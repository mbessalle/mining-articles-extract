Be careful with currency values—sometimes they write "$" and mean Australian dollars. You have to check the exchange or whether it says ASX or Australia. Other times they write AUD$ or A$, and sometimes it's from other countries like CAD.

Be careful with which projects they are referring to—sometimes they talk not only about the project mentioned in the filename, but also about other projects. If they don’t specify and mention a certain amount of resources allocated to all projects, then assume the distribution of resources to each one is equal.

Be careful with exploration commitments—sometimes they are mentioned as financial support for the project's activities. If it's stated in meters of drilling, 1 meter is equivalent to 200 USD.

Be careful with values in an article that refer to other projects—in that case, flag it as an error indicating it concerns a different project.

Be careful with links that refer to one project, but the PDF is about another project—in that case, flag it as an error indicating the link points to the wrong project.
