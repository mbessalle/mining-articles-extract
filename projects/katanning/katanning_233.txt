ASX Release 14 September 2023
Ausgold secures freehold properties at Katanning Gold Project
Acquisition covers key mining and infrastructure areas, significantly de-risking the project
Ausgold Limited (ASX: AUC) (Ausgold, or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has entered into binding
agreements to acquire two farming properties at its 100%-owned 3.04 million ounce Katanning Gold Project (KGP),
located 275km south-east of Perth in Western Australia.
The two properties cover a combined area of 1,026 hectares. One property, located within Mining Lease 70/488,
covers an area of 94 hectares and encompasses the southern extent of the Central Zone Resource (the Jinkas, Jinkas
South and Jackson deposits) – an area which will be a primary source of ore in the first 18 months of production at
the KGP. The vendor of this property is Mr John Smith.
The second property, located within Exploration Licences 70/2928 and 70/3952, covers an area of 932 hectares
and it is proposed that key mine infrastructure will be located on a part of this property. The vendor of this property
is Wallacup Holdings Pty Ltd. Ausgold will shortly proceed to lodge applications to convert the exploration tenure
over the property to Mining Leases.
The agreements are each on usual terms, with settlement of the acquisitions not subject to any material conditions
precedent and the total consideration being $10.76 million, with $3.12 million paid on signing of the agreements
and the balance to be paid in early April 2024. Ausgold is currently considering traditional and non-dilutive funding
alternatives to fund the deferred consideration and land acquisitions as part of the overarching project finance for
the development of the KGP.
The vendors are not related parties of the Company.
Ausgold Managing Director, Dr Matt Greentree, said:
“This is an important milestone for the Katanning Gold Project which reflects our intent to advance this large-scale
asset towards development. We are pleased to have reached agreement with two key landowners to secure these
properties, which cover significant parts of the early mine plan as well as proposed mine infrastructure. This is a
significant de-risking step for the development of a proposed long-term mining operation at the KGP.”
This announcement has been approved by the board of directors.
On behalf of the Board,
Matthew Greentree
