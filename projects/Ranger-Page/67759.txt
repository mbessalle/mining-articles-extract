# Silver Dollar Completes Acquisition of the Ranger-Page Project in Idaho's Silver Valley

The drill ready Ranger-Page Project is located in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District that ranks among the world's top producers of silver, lead and zinc.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - August 7, 2024) - **Silver Dollar Resources Inc. (CSE: SLV) (OTCQX: SLVDF) (FSE: 4YW) ("Silver Dollar" or the "Company")** is pleased to announce that, further to the news release of [July 15, 2024](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZAWqjCLeEz), it has completed the acquisition of the assets related to the Ranger-Page Project located in Shoshone County, Idaho, USA ([Figure 1](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ar8RBCeYbD)), which includes the option rights under the Government Gulch Option and Joint Venture Agreement and the Page Mine Mineral Rights Lease and Option Agreement.

_Project Highlights:_

  * A drill-ready project in a world-class silver district where over 90 mines have operated since the first major lead-zinc-silver discovery was staked in 1884.
  * Ideally situated approximately two kilometres (km) south of Interstate 90 Freeway and the town of Smelterville, the Project features power, water, year-round access to local infrastructure and a workforce skilled in exploration and mining.
  * The Project comprises two contiguous patented lode claim groups - Government Gulch (403 acres) and Page Mine (802 acres) - that consolidate the western end of the Silver Valley mining corridor under a single operator for the first time.
  * The land package covers six historic mines with the option to acquire ownership of the Project's mineral rights, which are not currently subject to any royalties.
  * Surface access rights are in place to allow Silver Dollar to conduct exploration activities, and the permitting process is with the State of Idaho, no federal permitting required.
  * Multiple exploration targets developed over the last two years and are ready to drill after the systematic use of modern exploration techniques for the first time.
  * Primary target areas are up-plunge from where historical underground mining ended, near surface, and targets have been defined laterally away from the footprint of the past producing mines.
  * Additional drill targets not associated with the historical mining areas have also been identified.
  * The Project borders the Bunker Hill mine that is on track to restart mining in Q4 2024.

_A Structurally Active Area:_

The ore deposits of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District are hosted in structural features characterized by a complex network of faults and folds resulting from tectonic forces of diverse ages and movements. The district occurs at the intersection of the west-northwest-trending Osburn Fault and a north-trending anticlinal (upfolded) structure called the Noxon Arch. 

The 27 km displacement of the Osburn Fault runs through the district's most productive silver belts and along the northern boundary of the Ranger-Page Project. A network of seven secondary faults transverses the Project area, with the north-south trending Page Fault (that hosts the Page Mine) at the western end and the Crown Point Fault at the eastern end intersecting the Osburn Fault. Additional faults include the east-west trending Curlew, 96, Buckeye and Spring faults and the southeast-northwest trending Government Gulch Fault (Figures [2](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2Ea7mTRZ41) and [3](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/MAwYyCK7PM)).

_Exploration Potential:_

Major discoveries in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District tend to result from deep exploration down plunge of near-surface mineral showings. Narrow veins near surface can blossom into multimillion-ounce ore bodies at depth, where vein structures intersect favourable rock formations. Consequently, the district remains an active region for exploration and mining even 140 years after Ag-Pb-Zn deposits were first discovered along the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River.

Consistent with the exploration history of the district, the Ranger-Page Project exhibits similar discovery potential near surface and at depth. This assessment is based on the comprehensive underground mining database that provides strong evidence of high-grade mineralization continuing at depth and along strike from where historical underground mining ended, and the latest exploration results from geophysical and geochemical surveys, extensive trenching and sampling, and geological mapping that have identified new target areas with potential near-surface mineralization.[1](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/bVWB1hOW40)

"We are thrilled with the acquisition of the Ranger-Page Project and thank all involved for their assistance in expediting the completion of the transaction," said Mike Romanik, president of Silver Dollar. "Our immediate exploration focus is on the near-surface targets recently discovered outside of the area of the historic mines."
