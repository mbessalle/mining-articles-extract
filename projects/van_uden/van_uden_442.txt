VALUE PROPOSITION
- STRATEGIC FIT AND SYNERGIES
Dual Commodity Strength – Diversifies risk through gold & lithium exposure, maximising
market opportunities
Strategic Expansion – Van Uden Gold adds a second high-value asset alongside Lake
Johnston Lithium
Fast-Track Potential – Granted mining leases, established haul roads and nearby gold
Plants provide near-term production potential
Exploration Upside – Gold system open along strike and down dip with strong growth
potential and secondary deposit opportunities
Regional Synergies – Located 100km from Lake Johnston, providing the ability to leverage
logistics, personnel and infrastructure
Market Advantage – Gold at record highs, positioning the project for immediate value
creation for TG6 shareholders
