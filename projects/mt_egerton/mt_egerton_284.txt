ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
4 November 2024 
AGREEMENT TO SELL GLENBURGH AND EGERTON 
GOLD PROJECTS TO BENZ MINING 
Sale of non-core assets is consistent with Spartan’s strategic focus on 
continued high-grade resource growth at its flagship Dalgaranga Project  
 
Spartan Resources Limited (Spartan or Company) (ASX: SPR) is pleased to advise that it has entered 
into a binding agreement to sell its non-core Glenburgh and Egerton Gold Projects in WA to Benz Mining 
Corp. (Benz) (ASX: BNZ) in a cash and scrip transaction valued at up to $15.6 million that will see it retain 
exposure to future exploration success at the projects through a significant shareholding in Benz.   
The gross consideration payable to Spartan is up to A$15.6 million, comprising A$1.0 million in cash1, 
A$8.6 million of Benz CHESS Depository Instruments2 and up to an additional A$6.0 million in contingent 
payments3. Completion of the transaction is expected in December 2024. 
Upon completion of the transaction, Spartan will become an approximately 15%4 shareholder in Benz 
and will be entitled to nominate a director to the Board of Benz (subject to satisfaction of certain 
conditions). As a result of the transaction, Spartan is expected to incur an approximately $17 million 
non-cash accounting impairment expense against the carrying value of the Glenburgh and Egerton 
Projects. 
Spartan Interim Executive Chairman, Simon Lawson, said: 
“The Glenburgh and Egerton Projects have undoubtedly suffered from a lack of attention within the 
Spartan Group in recent years as a result of the incredible success we have enjoyed at Dalgaranga. As 
a result, they are considered non-core within our portfolio given our focus on continuing to rapidly add 
high-grade ounces and advancing Dalgaranga towards a production re-start decision.  
“We are therefore pleased to have reached agreement with a funded and well-backed explorer in Benz 
Mining to give these assets a reinvigorated life. With a combined Mineral Resource Estimate of 537koz 
at 1.0g/t Au, Glenburgh and Egerton are exciting growth assets with demonstrated potential for high-
grade underground ounces – which is expected to be the focus of Benz’s exploration campaign.  
 
 
 
1 A$0.5 million cash consideration payable on completion and A$0.5 million 12-months after completion. 
2 Spartan to receive 33 million Benz CHESS Depository Instruments (CDIs) with equity consideration value based on the last traded price of 
Benz on the ASX of A$0.26 per CDI (as at 1 November 2024). 
3 Contingent payments are payable in three equal tranches of A$2 million (in cash or equity) on Benz declaring a Mineral Resource Estimate (at a 
minimum 2.0g/t cut-off) for the Glenburgh & Egerton Projects of (i) 500koz (ie. 7.8Mt at 2.0g/t Au); (ii) 1,000koz (ie. 15.6Mt at 2.0g/t Au); and (iii) 
1,500koz (ie. 23.3Mt at 2.0g/t Au). 
4 Based on Benz ordinary shares outstanding at 1 November 2024 and adjusted for the expected Benz equity raising as per its trading halt 
announcement on 4 November 2024.

“The Spartan team is looking forward to staying involved in the exploration at the Glenburgh & Egerton 
Projects and Nick Jolly – a key member of the Spartan geology team associated with the discovery of the 
Never Never and Pepper high-grade gold deposits – is the proposed Spartan nominee to the Benz Board.  
“Spartan will also be providing additional technical support and assistance to Benz given our history with 
the asset and capitalising on the insights gained at Dalgaranga – where our team have successfully 
discovered high-grade gold deposits close to historic lower grade open pit deposits.”

BACKGROUND ON SPARTAN RESOURCES 
Spartan Resources Limited (ASX: SPR) is an ASX-listed gold company which is pursuing a focused high-
grade gold exploration and development strategy centred on the 100%-owned Dalgaranga Gold Project, 
located 65km north-west of Mt Magnet in the Murchison Region of Western Australia. 
Spartan has overseen a remarkable turnaround of the Dalgaranga Project – which produced over 
70,000oz of gold in FY2022 prior to an operational reset in November 2022 commencing with placing the 
previous low grade open pit mining operations on care & maintenance. 
The discovery of the high-grade Never Never and Pepper Gold Deposits, less than 1km from the existing 
2.5Mtpa CIL processing plant and infrastructure, has been instrumental in this turnaround – underpinning 
a fresh vision and new approach based on the delineation of high-grade ounces close to existing 
infrastructure. 
The Never Never gold deposit is one of Australia’s most exciting new gold discoveries, with a high-grade 
Mineral Resource Estimate of 1.48Moz (5.72Mt at 8.07g/t) – including an Indicated classification of 
1.091Moz (3.88Mt at 8.74g/t) – and remains open along strike and at depth. The recent high-grade 
Pepper discovery, immediately adjacent to Never Never, comprises an initial Mineral Resource Estimate 
(all Inferred category) of 0.43Moz (1.78Mt at 7.66g/t Au) – and also remains open along strike and at 
depth. 
Spartan Resources is focused on continuing to deliver high-grade ounces at its flagship Dalgaranga Gold 
Project as the foundation for a sustainable long-term operating plan that will deliver strong returns for all 
key stakeholders. 
Spartan is committed to safe and respectful operation as a professional and considerate organisation within a 
diverse and varied community. Our people represent our culture and our culture is always to show respect to 
each other and to our community, to respect the unique environment we operate within and to show respect 
to all of our various stakeholders. This is reinforced by our recently refreshed core SPARTA values:
