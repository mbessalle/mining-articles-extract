# Orogen Royalties Sells the Celts Gold Project to Eminent Gold

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / December 12, 2024 /****(TSXV:OGN)(OTCQX:OGNRF)** Orogen Royalties Inc. ("Orogen" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a purchase and sale agreement (the "Agreement") with a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Eminent Gold ("Eminent") (TSX.V: EMNT) whereby Eminent has acquired the Celts gold project ("Celts" or the "Project"), located in Nevada, USA.

To acquire a 100% interest in Celts, Eminent will pay a total of US$400,000 consisting of cash and/or shares, subject to regulatory approval, and will grant a 3% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty, of which 1% can be purchased for US$1.5 million.

Pursuant to the terms of a generative alliance (the "Alliance") agreement between Altius Minerals Corporation (TSX:ALS) ("Altius") and Orogen previously announced September 12, 20221, proceeds from the sale of the Project will be split evenly between the Alliance participants whereby each party will receive US$200,000 in cash and/or shares and a 1.5% NSR royalty.

"Celts is one of four projects generated and the second sold to date under the Alliance with Altius, a collaboration of technical expertise to identify targets with geological similarities to the Expanded Silicon project in the Walker Lane Trend, Nevada," commented Orogen's CEO and President, Paddy Nicol. "Celts is representative of Orogen's business model of organic royalty generation, creating exposure to new discoveries with significant leverage to value potential. We are excited to partner with the Eminent team and look forward to their exploration efforts."

** _About the Celts Gold Project_**

The 560-hectare Celts project is located in southeastern Nevada, thirteen kilometres northeast of the historic high-sulphidation Goldfield district and one-hundred kilometres northwest of the Silicon discovery (Figure 1). Celts contains a cell of advanced argillic alteration that is recognized to be steam heated alteration within a low-sulphidation system. The steam cap remains undrilled.

The alteration cell at Celts is centered on a Tertiary rhyolite dome with an eight-hundred metre diameter zone of alteration composed of alunite and kaolinite interspersed with regions of fine-grained silica flooding (Figure 2). Celts could be one of the few epithermal systems in Nevada associated with slab window magmatism, like the Silicon (3.4Moz of indicated and 800Koz inferred gold resources) and Merlin (9.05Moz gold resource inferred) deposits, where Orogen holds a 1% NSR royalty.

Similar to the Silicon deposit, there is no gold at surface in the steam cap, but peripheral gold, including grab samples up to 33 grams per tonne, occurs in quartz veins associated with illite and adularia at lower elevations one to two kilometres from the dome (Figure 2). Taken together, the central steam cap and peripheral gold-bearing mineralized structures define a four-square kilometre mineral system.

The property is on road-accessible BLM land with a clear and unencumbered pathway to drill testing.

**_Transaction Details_**

Orogen, Altius and Eminent have signed an Agreement whereby Eminent has acquired a 100% interest in the Celts Project by paying US$400,000 consisting of US$30,000 cash and US$45,000 in common shares of Eminent at closing, and US$325,000 consisting of cash and/or shares, at the discretion of Eminent, within six months from the date of signing. Eminent will also grant a 3% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty, of which 1% can be purchased for US$1.5 million.

The issuance of Eminent shares is subject to regulatory approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.
