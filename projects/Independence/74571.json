The Independence Project is owned by Independence Mining LLC (“IML”), an incorporated joint venture between Battle Mountain Resources Pty Ltd (‘BMR”) (51.54%, the “BMR Interest”) and Americas Gold Exploration Inc (‘AGEI\") (48.46%, the “AGE Interest”). The Company has agreed to acquire 100% of the issued capital of BMR and, in turn, will acquire the BMR Interest and the right to earn the AGE! Interest over a period of two years. If the Company completes the eam-in, it will hold a 100% interest in IML and the Independence Project. The transformational acquisition ensures that the Company is now underpinned by an advanced exploration asset, with significant resource growth potential and future low-cost development opportunities in a Tier-1 global mining jurisdiction. James Bay Executive Director, Andrew Dornan, commented: “This is an exceptional opportunity for our shareholders and we are extremely fortunate to have secured this acquisition and earn-in at the Independence Gold Project. This gives us the opportunity to enhance our existing asset base in North America with a substantial high-grade gold asset with immediate growth potential. “The combination of existing high-grade resources, significant growth potential at both the near-surface and skarn deposits, and a location in one of the best mining districts globally presents a huge opportunity for the Company. We are very excited about what this transformational deal brings to JBY.” The Project contains an NI 43-101 Mineral Resource as outlined below: \" Gold (Au) g/t Gold (Au) Description Tonnes Gold (Au) g/t Ent aan Gold (Au) Oz Equivalent 022 Skarn — Mineral Resource | ewes | 3794000 | 65 | 655 | 796200 | 796200 | 8.713,000 108,800 125.900 | ndcated | 10284000 | 036 | 040 | 224500 | 249600 | [ewes | 5218000 | 030 | 033 | 50800 | 85100 | The Mineral Resource Estimate at the Independence Gold Project is a foreign estimate prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101.
