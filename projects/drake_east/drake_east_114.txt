Antimony Uses
Classified as a Critical Mineral by key global economies UK, EU,
USA, Australia, Japan.
Considered a Critical, Strategic and Industrial metal due to its
wide range of applications.
Antimony is used in the production of semiconductors,
batteries, solar panels, ammunition and artillery shells, high-end
military hardware such as night-vision goggles, flame retardants,
cables.

US Critical Mineral Policy
The critical mineral issue is one of America’s
most pressing national security challenges.
For countless military and commercial
applications, America is overly reliant on
China and others for minerals.
US President Trump has issued executive
orders to review policy and spur domestic
action to strengthen USA’s supply of critical
metals, including declaring critical metals
supply a national emergency.
Trump’s recent actions abroad (Ukraine) indicate recognition that USA will work with its
allies such as Australia to secure its critical mineral supply.

Drake East, NSW
On a regional perspective, the Drake East Project is well placed.
Antimony is commonly found in the region in association with gold in epizonal orogenic systems.
Many historical goldfields in northeast NSW are known to host high-grade antimony mineralisation,
including Larvotto Resources’ (ASX: LRV) Hillgrove Mine and Trigg’s (ASX: TGM) Wild Cattle Creek
deposit.
Hillgrove is one of the ten largest antimony resources globally and Australia’s largest antimony deposit.
As well developing the antimony potential of the Drake East Project, the Company will also pursue the
gold (silver and copper) potential.
Limited systematic and modern exploration at Drake East represents significant opportunity for RML.
RML plans to initiate systematic exploration programs, including geophysical surveys, geochemical
sampling, and drilling campaigns, to evaluate the mineral potential of these projects.

Neardie Antimony Project, QLD
The Company’s second antimony-focused project is the Neardie Antimony Project,
located approximately 20km north-northeast of Gympie, in QLD.
It hosts the historic Neardie stibnite mines, which have been a significant producer
of high-grade antimony ore, with intermittent operations since the 1890s.
Underground rock chip sampling at the Neardie Antimony Mine in 1971 yielded
results up to 19.5% Sb
It is RML’s opinion that significant extensions of high-grade antimony are
possible, not only along strike and at depth, but in parallel systems, as was
concluded in 1974 “the prospects of finding additional ore shoots in parallel and
faulted lodes are favourable” J. Siemon 1974).
