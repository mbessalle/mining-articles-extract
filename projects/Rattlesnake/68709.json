Geologically, the Project is centrally located within a roughly 1,500-kilometre-long belt of alkalic intrusive complexes that occur along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains from Montana to New Mexico, several of which are associated with multiple gold deposits.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">The Project has approximately 100,000 metres (“m”) of historic drilling which has outlined three significant zones of alteration and precious metal mineralization that are associated with Eocene age alkalic intrusions at North Stock, Antelope Basin and Blackjack. The majority of the drilling has focused on near-surface, open pit mineralization in the North Stock and Antelope Basin deposits with highlights that include intercepts<sup>(</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>)</sup> of 1.85 grams of gold per tonne (g/t Au) over 236.2 m hole length; 4.20 g/t Au over 77.7 m hole length; 2.08 g/t Au over 150.9 m hole length and 0.82 g/t Au over 99.1 m hole length. In addition to the outlined zones of mineralization, the Company believes that the district is highly prospective and has outlined several kilometre-scale greenfield targets that have never been drill tested. These greenfield targets were generated from the Company’s geophysical and geochemical programs and host strong similarities to the North Stock and Antelope Basin systems.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><sup>(</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>)</sup> Gold intervals reported are based on a 0.20 g/t or 0.50 g/t Au cutoff. Weighted averaging has been used to calculate all reported intervals. True widths are estimated at 60-100% of drilled thicknesses.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>About Patriot Gold Vault</u></strong> <strong><u>Ltd.</u></strong><br />Patriot Gold Vault is a gold mineral resource aggregator whose principal activity is to acquire high quality resource-ready gold assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions. Led by a team of proven technical and financial mining executives, Patriot will focus on increasing asset resources via drilling in Phase 1 and profitably divesting of its assets in Phase 2.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>About GFG Resources Inc.</u></strong> <br />GFG is a North American precious metals exploration company focused on district scale gold projects in tier one mining jurisdictions, Ontario and Wyoming. In Ontario, the Company operates three gold projects, each large and highly prospective gold properties within the prolific gold district of Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The projects have similar geological settings that host most of the gold deposits found in the Timmins Gold Camp which have produced over 70 million ounces of gold. The Company also owns 100% of the Rattlesnake Hills Gold Project, a district scale gold exploration project located approximately 100 km southwest of Casper, Wyoming, U.S.</p>  <p><strong><em>For further information, please contact: </em></strong><br />Brian Skanderbeg, President &amp; CEO<br />or <br />Marc Lepage, Vice President, Business Development <br />Phone: (306) 931-0930 <br />Email: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xG644v6yEl_dfaSvl0iAj9yNGdGualJvKHbWlOD-EWi9Q1FT5QHtbf0O8XbPPMrE1mlHFO57YTKCb_oCgNgvWClU-OQHilIURJVY3akJuEU=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"info@gfgresources.com\">info@gfgresources.com</a><br />Website: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yB2GRrTq50vKyGULLuoapgdnWnUlZSHnUGbSxzMRJjiYe4vlddvC6FcVPpJEVxgw_zTYNmW5EDCNpb0bqfolKgfgMga0EAuQAj1BCd7hA_8=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.gfgresources.com\">www.gfgresources.com</a>  </p>  <p><strong>Stay Connected with Us</strong><br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LWYkS0hU_n-6GtuCxI6REMQgH7DA08DS3F9pAR9ksKBlNeJ9GJX27fHXc2f7GOt2Y9c-NrnHS8l7hvh4pnwwhg-nY_DW1zJPNnRow36wkoE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@gfgresources\">@gfgresources</a><br />LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tHf9XYZkUbjkT3xuhPtngodwKS3mlNeD66YhiT_tg8js8Y2Z72hyGLwm5XyPrGtgjFphf1tXwsJ5akQqtEg_3GMI84aDIdQlA6NAD4cuyA55-rCIyGVlsIntfetdtrBkeblFdPO_Cq_Obs4VPKO1Zs4Zt70KCxtIaLVdaHNRAFE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/gfgresources/</a><br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tHf9XYZkUbjkT3xuhPtnghpwxPUdNJtK-W36cJUt-9BUUSw3jOgxxj_-dBqtBQYTu85z5byOHibw3zSGjvkbC9rTibVPakC7airryNiiaMIo5L4PcvnOIZ0jDJb8nnYyWbEiBwwB-isUhHHO_iiIGw==\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">https://www.facebook.com/GFGResourcesInc/</a></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><em>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</em></p>  <p><strong>CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">All statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this news release constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (referred to herein as “forward-looking statements”).
