“We’ve picked up 113km² of first-class gold tenure in our strategic location. There 
are gold mines all around us. There are lots of historic workings and mining activity. 
There’s a distinct whiff of gold in the air with these tenements and we’re looking 
forward to proving up their potential. 
 
“The package surrounds many of the Westgold (ASX: WGX) mines in the area. The 
acquisition of the Loded Dog tenements shows our enthusiasm to expand Auric’s 
footprint,” said Mr English.  
 
The Announcement 
 
Auric Mining Limited (ASX: AWJ) (Auric or the Company) is pleased to announce 
that through its wholly owned entity Widgie Gold Pty Ltd (WGPL) it has entered into 
an agreement to purchase 8 tenements from Loded Dog Prospecting Pty Ltd (Loded 
Dog), covering 113 square kilometres in the Widgiemooltha-Higginsville district, 
subject to one condition precedent. 
 
The acquisition complements Auric’s ground holding in the highly prospective 
Higginsville location. Settlement will take place once the condition precedent, 
which relates to the assignment of various heritage protection agreements and 
access deeds, is satisfied. All contracts were executed late yesterday afternoon. 
 
The Tenement Sale Agreement (TSA) specifies that Auric will pay $475,000 (plus GST) 
in cash to Loded Dog at settlement and completion. 
 
In addition, the two parties have agreed on the following milestone payments:  
 
i. 
If a JORC compliant resource of greater than 20,000oz of gold, or a JORC 
compliant resource of any commodity measured on a >20,000oz gold 
equivalent basis, at a 0.5g/t cut off, is defined by WGPL on any of the 
tenements, WGPL will pay $100,000 (plus GST) in cash; and 
 
ii. 
If a JORC compliant resource of greater than 50,000oz of gold, or a JORC 
compliant resource of any commodity measured on a >50,000oz gold 
equivalent basis, at a 0.5g/t cut off, is defined by WGPL on any of the 
tenements, WGPL will pay an additional $150,000 (plus GST) in cash.  
 
The Company has also agreed to grant the following royalties: 
a) For any gold produced - a net smelter royalty of 1.5%. 
b) For any other minerals – a net smelter royalty of 0.75% to 1.5%, depending on

Auric’s existing tenements in the Higginsville area (Figure 1) such that Auric now has 
a substantial footholding in this area.  
 
The presence of numerous recently mined open pits and underground gold 
operations in close proximity to the tenements highlights the prospectivity of the new 
tenements. Those gold operations include the Trident mine which was one of the 
largest underground gold mines in the area, producing 1.045Moz from 7.434Mt at 
an average grade of 4.4g/t between 2008 and 2016. 
 
The Amorphous Prospect and to a lesser extent, the Foote’s Find Prospect have 
been explored by Resolute Limited, Australian Gold Resources and most recently by 
Argonaut Resources (now Orpheus Uranium) (Orpheus).  
 
Amorphous Prospect 
 
The Amorphous Prospect was recognised in 1990 following systematic (ie, grid-
based) soil sampling and follow-up aircore drilling by Resolute Limited. Further 
aircore and RAB drilling followed. 
 
The first RC holes were drilled into the prospect in 1994 by Resolute Limited with 
further RC drilling in 2007 by Australian Gold Resources and in 2020 by Orpheus.

Orpheus described drill hole anomalism over approximately 1km strike length as 
defined by a total of 114 holes, comprising 36 RAB holes, 35 aircore holes and 43 RC 
holes (Figure 2). Drilling is relatively shallow with RC holes averaging 80m vertical 
depth, aircore 15m and RAB holes 50m depth. All significant assays at a 0.5g/t cut-
off are recorded in Appendix A; hole details are recorded in Appendix B; and a 
JORC checklist in Appendix C.

Figure 2. Amorphous Prospect Drill Hole Plan and geology. 
 
The mineralisation lies along the western margin of a north-south aligned shear 
hosted in strongly altered ultramafics and dolerites, bound by metasediments to the 
west and mafic rocks (basalt) to the east. Gold mineralisation has been described 
in association with quartz veining, biotite and carbonate alteration and pyrite and 
arsenopyrite. 
 
Drilling has concentrated on a western zone of mineralisation but a single line of 
deeper RC holes approximately 100m to the east represents a second zone of 
mineralisation and a separate drill target (eg, HGC02 in Figure 3).

Foote’s Find Prospect 
 
Foote’s Find is focussed on two small open pits developed by a prospector, Mr 
Foote, in the 1980s in conjunction with Falcona Exploration and Mining NL. Reports 
suggest that the pit was based on results from RAB drilling and that the mining was 
unsuccessful. No record of those RAB holes has been found.  
 
The two pits extend along approximately 300m of strike (Figure 4). Drilling by Resolute 
in the 1990’s focussed on the two small pits with 21 RC holes drilled (FFP series). 
Resolute also drilled 11 shallow (ie 6m) aircore holes over a small area of tailings a 
short distance to the northwest of the pits. Three more RC holes were drilled in the 
same area by Orpheus in 2020 (FFRC series).

Future Work 
 
At the Amorphous Prospect, numerous mineralised intercepts remain open towards 
surface, down dip or along strike. The mineralisation intersected in holes along the 
eastern margin of the prospect is separated by as much 360m between drill sections. 
Auric plans to better define mineralisation at Amorphous with an RC drill program 
comprising at least 20 drill holes. 
 
RC drilling at Foote’s Find will focus on the northern of the two small pits where there 
is potential to expand the known mineralisation. Westgold’s (ASX: WGX) Pioneer 
deposit lies 11km to the south of Foote’s Find along the same distinctive magnetic 
stratigraphy. Aircore drilling will be used to test that mineralised trend to the north 
and south of Foote’s Find. 
 
Drilling is very sparse in the other tenements acquired from Loded Dog and the 
efficacy of historic soil sampling remains to be determined. In combination with 
other tenements held by Auric in the area, the Company will review historic results 
in relation to open pitted gold deposits and magnetics, and geological and 
structural interpretation will be undertaken. It is expected that numerous targets will 
be generated in this way.

Amorphous and Foote’s Find Prospects – Historic Drilling JORC 
Table 1 Checklist 
 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to the succeeding section) 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling 
(e.g. cut channels, random 
chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals 
under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be 
taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
Include reference to measures 
taken to ensure sample 
representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems 
used. 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material 
to the Public Report. 
In cases where ‘industry 
standard’ work has been done 
this would be relatively simple 
(e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling 
was used to obtain 1 m samples 
from which 3 kg was pulverised 
to produce a 30 g charge for fire 
assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, 
such as where there is coarse 
gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities 
or mineralisation types (e.g. 
submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed 
information. 
Orpheus 
• 
Orpheus RC samples were 
logged for lithology, 
weathering, alteration and 
mineralisation. Representative 
samples for each sample 
interval were retained in chip 
trays. QA/QC procedures 
included CRMs and blanks 
inserted at a rate of 1 each 
per 20 sample respectively for 
1m split sampling. 
• Individual 1m samples 
collected via a rotary cone 
splitter. 4m RC drill chip 
composites sampled using a 
spear throughout. Where 4m 
composite samples have 
returned Au values greater 
than or equal to 0.05 g/t, 1 
metre rotary cone splits 
submitted  
• RC samples were dried, 
crushed, split, pulverised and 
pulps taken for 30g Fire Assay 
digest followed by analysis by 
AAS for Au. Multi-element 
analysis by Aqua Regia digest 
and analysis by ICP- MS 
techniques.  
• All sample preparation was 
conducted by ALS Kalgoorlie, 
Au analysis by ALS Kalgoorlie 
and multi-element analysis by 
ALS Perth. 
Resolute 
• Resolute drilled RAB, aircore 
and RC holes in the Foote’s

Find/Amorphous Prospects 
• RC holes were sampled at 1m 
intervals. 
• Aircore and RAB holes were 
sampled as composites at 4m 
intervals. Samples returning gold 
concentrations of 0.10ppm or 
higher were resampled at 1m 
intervals 
• Composite samples were 
assayed by either Minlabs or 
Kalgoorlie Assay Laboratories in 
Kalgoorlie using a 25g charge 
and aqua regia digest with AAS 
finish 
• One metre resamples were 
assayed for Au at Analabs and 
one metre RC samples were 
assayed at Minlabs in Kalgoorlie 
using a 25g charge and aqua 
regia digest with AAS finish. 
 
Australian Gold Resources 
• One metre RC samples were 
geologically logged and 
composited into 4m samples 
using a hand scoop 
• One metre RAB samples were 
composited into 4m samples 
using a pipe sampler 
• Composite RAB and RC samples 
were assayed for Au and As via 
aqua regia digest and AAS 
finish at Genalysis Laboratory 
Services in Perth. Bottom of hole 
RAB samples were also 
analysed for a suite of elements. 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse 
circulation, open-hole hammer, 
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, 
depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, 
whether core is oriented and if so, 
by what method, etc). 
• RAB, aircore and RC drilling 
techniques are not described in 
the available reports. The drilling 
took place from 2000 onwards, 
by which time RC sampling was 
by face sampling hammer 
throughout the WA goldfields.

Drill sample 
recovery 
Method of recording and 
assessing core and chip sample 
recoveries and results assessed. 
Measures taken to maximize 
sample recovery and ensure 
representative nature of the 
samples. 
Whether a relationship exists 
between sample recovery and 
grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of 
fine/coarse material. 
• Drill chip recoveries and wet 
samples were recorded by 
Orpheus. It is not known 
whether Resolute or Australian 
Gold Resources did the same. 
 
Logging 
Whether core and chip samples 
have been geologically and 
geotechnically logged to a level 
of detail to support appropriate 
Mineral Resource estimation, 
mining studies and metallurgical 
studies. 
Whether logging is qualitative or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or 
costean, channel, etc) 
photography. 
The total length and percentage 
of the relevant intersections 
logged. 
• Drill chips were logged at 1m 
intervals corresponding to the 
sample intervals and according 
to the different companies 
coding systems. 
• The drill data is appropriate to 
exploration but may not be 
suitable for resource estimation. 
Further validation would be 
required if some of the drill data 
is utilised in resource estimation. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and sample 
preparation 
If core, whether cut or sawn and 
whether quarter, half or all cores 
taken. 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube 
sampled, rotary split, etc and 
whether sampled wet or dry. 
For all sample types, the nature, 
quality and appropriateness of the 
sample preparation technique. 
Quality control procedures 
adopted for all sub-sampling 
stages to maximise representivity 
of samples. 
Measures taken to ensure that the 
sampling is representative of the 
in-situ material collected, including 
for instance results for field 
duplicate/second-half sampling. 
Whether sample sizes are 
appropriate to the grain size of the 
material being sampled. 
• RC chips were sampled at 1m 
intervals via either a riffle splitter 
or fixed cone splitter and all 
Orpheus samples were dry. 
There is no record as to wet 
sampling by the other 
companies. 
• Orpheus utilised CRMs and 
inserted blanks at a ratio of 1 in 
20 samples for 1m RC sampling.  
• QA procedures utilised by 
Resolute and Australian Gold 
Resources are not recorded

Quality of 
assay data 
and 
laboratory 
tests 
The nature, quality and 
appropriateness of the assaying 
and laboratory procedures used 
and whether the technique is 
considered partial or total. 
For geophysical tools, 
spectrometers, handheld XRF 
instruments, etc, the parameters 
used in determining the analysis 
including instrument make and 
model, reading times, calibrations 
factors applied and their 
derivation, etc. 
Nature of quality control 
procedures adopted (e.g. 
standards, blanks, duplicates, 
external laboratory checks) and 
whether acceptable levels of 
accuracy (ie lack of bias) and 
precision have been established. 
• Orpheus utilised CRMs and 
inserted blanks at a ratio of 1 in 
20 samples for 1m RC sampling.  
• QA procedures utilised by 
Resolute and Australian Gold 
Resources are not recorded 
 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
The verification of significant 
intersections by either 
independent or alternative 
company personnel. 
The use of twinned holes. 
Documentation of primary data, 
data entry procedures, data 
verification, data storage (physical 
and electronic) protocols. 
Discuss any adjustment to assay 
data. 
• The sampling and assaying 
data is derived from historic 
records, including annual 
reports. There are no twinned 
holes. Auric would need to drill 
a number of holes to validate 
historic drill hole data sets 
before any historic data could 
be utilised in a resource 
estimate 
Location of 
data points 
Accuracy and quality of surveys 
used to locate drill holes (collar 
and down-hole surveys), trenches, 
mine workings and other locations 
used in Mineral Resource 
estimation. 
Specification of the grid system 
used. 
Quality and adequacy of 
topographic control. 
Orpheus 
• 
Hole collar positions were 
located using a hand-held GPS 
referenced to MGA-GDA94, 
Zone 51 and are accurate to 
within 5m. 
• Downhole surveys for RC holes 
were taken by the drilling 
contractor using a gyro at 
approximately 30m intervals.  
• Collar surveys included an 
elevation measurement and 
are located within the MGA-
GDA94 grid system, Zone 51 
Resolute 
• Resolute drill holes were 
referenced to AMG-AGD84 and 
since transformed to MGA-

Data spacing 
and 
distribution 
Data spacing for reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
Whether the data spacing and 
distribution is sufficient to establish 
the degree of geological and 
grade continuity appropriate for 
the Mineral Resource and Ore 
Reserve estimation procedure(s)

Whether sample compositing has 
been applied. 
• At this early exploration stage, 
the data is represented entirely 
by historic drilling with 
insufficient QA to be 
incorporated into a resource 
estimate. 
Amorphous 
• There are 114 holes drilled into 
the Amorphous Prospect, 
comprising 35 aircore, 36 RAB

Orientation of 
data in 
relation to 
geological 
structure 
Whether the orientation of 
sampling achieves unbiased 
sampling of possible structures and 
the extent to which this is known, 
considering the deposit type. 
If the relationship between the 
drilling orientation and the 
orientation of key mineralised 
structures is considered to have 
introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if 
material. 
• Orpheus have interpreted 
mineralisation at Amorphous to 
dip at approximately 60 such 
that drill intercepts down hole 
will be exaggerated by 
approximately 115% of true 
widths. This interpretation 
requires further drilling to 
substantiate. 
• A provisional interpretation 
suggests a steep, near vertical 
easterly dip to mineralisation at 
Foote’s Find. This interpretation 
also requires further drilling to 
substantiate. 
 
 
Sample 
security 
The measures taken to ensure 
sample security. 
• There is no record of security 
protocols utilised by the 
different exploration companies 
at either prospect. 
Audits or 
reviews 
The results of any audits or reviews 
of sampling techniques and data. 
• There have been no reviews of 
sampling techniques and data 
related to the historic drill data.

exclusion does not detract from 
the understanding of the report, 
the Competent Person should 
clearly explain why this is the case. 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (e.g. cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are 
usually Material and should be 
stated. 
Where aggregate intercepts 
incorporate short lengths of high-
grade results and longer lengths of 
low-grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should 
be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations 
should be shown in detail. 
The assumptions used for any 
reporting of metal equivalent 
values should be clearly stated. 
• Samples were collected at 1m 
intervals and either 
composited to 4m intervals or 
assayed at 1m intervals. 
Aggregate intervals 
incorporate either composite 
intervals or 1m intervals. 
• Samples were aggregated at 
a 0.5g/t cut-off with no top-
cut applied 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
If the geometry of the 
mineralisation with respect to the 
drill hole angle is known, its nature 
should be reported. 
If it is not known and only the 
down hole lengths are reported, 
there should be a clear statement 
to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole 
length, true width not known’). 
• The orientation of 
mineralisation has yet to be 
confirmed. Historic 
interpretations suggest steep 
dips to mineralisation at 
Foote’s Find (~80˚) and 
Amorphous (~60˚) such that 
true widths would be between 
65% and 85% of drill intercepts 
in drill holes angled at 60˚ from 
surface 
 
 
Diagrams 
Appropriate maps and sections 
(with scales) and tabulations of 
intercepts should be included for 
any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but 
not be limited to a plan view of 
drill hole collar locations and 
appropriate sectional views. 
• Refer to Figures 2-3 and 
Appendix A. 
Balanced 
reporting 
Where comprehensive reporting 
of all Exploration Results is not 
practicable, representative 
reporting of both low and high 
• Reporting is balanced – only 
significant Au values at a 
0.5g/t cut-off are tabulated
