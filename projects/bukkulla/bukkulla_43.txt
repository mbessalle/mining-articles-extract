ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 4 February 2025
TRIGG EXPANDS ANTIMONY PORTFOLIO WITH PAST
PRODUCING HIGH GRADE ANTIMONY PROJECT
EXCEEDING MINING GRADES OF 25% Sb
HIGHLIGHTS
• Trigg expands its NSW antimony portfolio by acquiring the historic Bukkulla Mine
and an extension to the Nundle Goldfield.
• Expands Trigg’s antimony footprint to 1,026km2 adding to its substantial existing
717km2 regional portfolio, which includes the Wild Cattle Creek 29,902-tonne
antimony resource1 at its Achilles Project, and the Taylors Arm and Spartan projects
• High-grade antimony confirmed: The Bukkulla Mine previously produced antimony
at grades exceeding 25% Sb, while recent rock chip sampling returned a value of
~23% Sb2.
• Strategic expansion: The tenement applications include the northern extension of
the Nundle Goldfield, one of NSW's most significant gold-producing regions in the
19th century. The presence of historical Fogarty, Woodley, and Stanning antimony
mines within the Nundle Goldfield underscores the area's prospectivity for high-
grade antimony mineralisation.
• Untapped potential: No modern exploration has been conducted on these
tenements, presenting a significant opportunity for discovery.
• Exploration roadmap: Trigg plans to conduct systematic exploration, including
geophysical surveys, sampling, and drilling programs, to test the depth extensions of
the historically productive Bukkulla Mine and explore high-priority targets within the
Nundle Goldfield.
Trigg Minerals Limited (ASX: TMG) is pleased to announce it has submitted three
Exploration Licence Applications (ELAs) – ELA 6870, ELA 6871, and ELA 6872 – within the
highly prospective New England Orogen in New South Wales (Figure 1).
The New England Orogen is a well-known geological region with a strong history of
mineral discoveries, including antimony, gold, silver, copper, and other critical minerals.
These three applications represent an exciting strategic opportunity to expand Trigg
Minerals’ portfolio and align with the company’s focus on exploration in regions with
proven potential for economic mineralisation.

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 4 February 2025
Key highlights of the applications include:
• ELA 6870 (Bukkulla Antimony Project): Covers 87km² (29 units) of highly
prospective ground with known antimony mineral occurrences, including the historic
Bukkulla mine workings, where a single rock chip returned 22.9% Sb and past mining
grades reportedly exceeded 25% Sb3. The deposit's chemistry is consistent, featuring
high Sb, As, Ag and elevated Au, characteristic of Hillgrove-type antimony deposits.
• ELA 6871 (North Nundle Antimony Project): Targets antimony and gold
mineralisation within a structurally favourable setting adjacent to the Peel Fault and
in the immediate extension to the historical Nundle Goldfield, one of the most
significant goldfields in NSW during the 19th century.
• ELA 6872 (Tia Antimony Project): Encompasses multiple underexplored deep leads
and reef gold occurrences, offering significant regional opportunities.
Trigg’s technical team has assessed the New England region and identified these areas
as prospective targets based on geological data and historical exploration results. Once
granted, Trigg plans to initiate systematic exploration programs, including geophysical
surveys, geochemical sampling, and drilling campaigns, to evaluate the mineral
potential of these projects.
Executive Chairman Tim Morrison commented: “This is an exciting step forward for
Trigg Minerals as we continue to diversify and grow our exploration footprint in highly
prospective regions like the New England Orogen. These new applications demonstrate
our commitment to unlocking shareholder value by targeting highly prospective areas
with strong potential for further major discoveries.”
The licence applications add to Trigg’s substantial existing 717km2 regional portfolio,
which includes the Wild Cattle Creek 29,902-tonne antimony resource4 at its Achilles
Project, and the Taylors Arm and Spartan projects.
Trigg will provide further updates as the exploration licences progress through the
approval process and as work programs are developed for these new projects.
Summary of Bukkulla Mine Workings
Historical workings extend 18m deep and 9m along strike, following an intrusive-related
or a meta hydrothermal vein linked to the nearby Bundarra Plutonic Granitoid. Located
at 310775mE, 6739344mN (AMG84, Z56), the site has a substantial dump with stibnite-
bearing veins hosted in altered Texas Beds. Sampling of massive stibnite and gangue
(Analysis G94/48) returned 0.106 g/t Au, 47 g/t Ag, 22.9% Sb, and 1,300 g/t As3.

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 4 February 2025
Antimony Potential in the Nundle Goldfield
The Nundle Goldfield, one of New South Wales’ most historically significant gold-
producing regions, also holds untapped potential for antimony mineralisation. While
primarily known for its rich gold deposits, the area's geological setting suggests a strong
prospectivity for antimony, particularly in association with quartz-sulphide veining and
shear-hosted mineralisation.
Geological Context
The Nundle Goldfield sits within the New England Fold Belt, a region with a well-
documented history of gold and base metal mineralisation focused along the Peel Fault.
Antimony (Sb) is commonly found alongside gold in epizonal orogenic systems, often
occurring in the form of stibnite (Sb₂S₃). Given that many historical goldfields in northeast
NSW also host high-grade antimony deposits—such as Hillgrove and Trigg’s Wild Cattle
Creek deposit—there is strong potential for similar mineralisation at Nundle.
Historical Indicators
• Presence of Past-Producing Antimony Mines: The Fogarty’s, Woodly’s, and
Stanning’s antimony mines are located within the Nundle Goldfield, providing
direct evidence of significant antimony mineralisation in the region.
• Gold-Antimony Association exists in the adjacent Nundle Goldfield: In many
NSW deposits, gold and antimony occur together, with high-grade stibnite often
found in quartz veins carrying gold.
• Limited Modern Exploration: Despite its historical significance, the Nundle
Goldfield has seen little systematic exploration for antimony, meaning significant
mineralisation could remain undiscovered.
Exploration and Future Potential
With modern exploration techniques, including geophysical surveys, geochemical
sampling, and targeted drilling, Trigg can define new high-grade antimony targets at
Bukkulla and in the Nundle Goldfield. Key factors supporting this potential include:
• Presence of Favourable Structures: Shear zones and fault systems, known
hosts for antimony in similar geological settings.
• Historical Mining Activity: Past workings may provide clues to undiscovered
extensions of mineralised systems.
The Bukkulla and Nundle Projects present a promising but underexplored opportunity for
high-grade antimony mineralisation. With no modern exploration conducted, Trigg is
well-positioned to unlock the field’s antimony potential through systematic exploration,
potentially adding significant value to its expanding NSW antimony portfolio.

Cautionary Statement
The tabled result for sampling at the historical Bukkulla working is sourced from a public
document: Inverell 1:250 000 Metallogenic Map SH/56-5: Metallogenic Study and
Mineral Deposit Data Sheets by Brown R.E. & Stroud W.J. and released by the Geological
Survey of New South Wales in 1997. The Bukkulla deposit data is from the Department's
Mineral Resources Land Information System (MRLIS). This integrated relational database
permits graphic and text inquiries about mineral deposits, geology, mining and
exploration titles. The listed location (coordinate) information refers to the site of a
historical work, not the sample collection point. The exact sample location isn't specified
but is described in relation to the historical working. For example, samples from a nearby
mullock dump were collected within or near the working. Trigg confirms that a geologist
from the NSW Geological Survey conducted the sampling to characterise the identified
mineralisation at the historical working. The discussed Bukkulla deposit is confirmed to
be located within ELA 6870. The Fogarty’s, Woodly’s, and Stanning’s antimony mines
from the Nundle Goldfield lie in the adjacent tenement, southeast of the Nundle
application.
The announcement was authorised for release by the Board of Trigg Minerals Limited.
