"We have now fulfilled all of our obligations to Waterton in respect of the acquisition of Gabbs, and with the payment from the sale of the Ball Creek Claims, we are funded through the coming year and into the next," commented Joe Ovsenek, President and CEO of P2.  "What's more, with the increase in metal prices, under the Company's preliminary economic assessment announced on May 22, 2024 and described in the Gabbs Technical Report dated May 17, 2024 (available under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360395-1&h=2497773367&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedarplus.com%2F&a=www.sedarplus.com)), Gabbs has an internal rate of return of 43.3% and net present value at a 5% discount rate of US$1.2 billion at today's spot metal prices of $2,909 gold, $32 silver and $4.22 copper.  We look forward to providing further updates as we advance Gabbs."
