STAGED OPTION AGREEMENT TO 
ACQUIRE TWO HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE 
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN URANIUM PROJECTS 
Highlights 
• 
Core Energy Minerals enters into options to acquire up to a 100% interest in the Cummins Project and 
Harris Greenstone Project, two highly prospective uranium projects, covering a combined area of 
over 2,300km2 in the Tier 1 uranium exploration and mining jurisdiction of South Australia. 
• 
Historic drilling results at the 952km2 Cummins Project show widespread palaeochannel hosted 
uranium mineralisation over a distance of approximately 10 kilometres and similar in nature to the 
nearby Alligator Energy (ASX: AGE) 17.5Mlbs U3O8 Samphire Project1. 
• 
The 1,350km2 Harris Greenstone Project covers unexplored extensions of the well-defined 
palaeochannels hosting nearby 1.48Mlb Warrior Uranium Deposit2, with Native Title 9B access 
agreement already in place enabling fast tracked on-ground exploration. 
• 
On-ground exploration including mapping, confirmatory drilling and geophysical surveys at the 
Cummins Project is planned to commence in Q1 2025, with drilling proposed to commence 
immediately following receipt of statutory approvals. 
 
Core Energy Minerals Limited (ASX:CR3) (“Core Energy” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the signing 
of two binding staged option agreements to acquire up to a 100% interest in two uranium projects comprising a 
total of 3 granted exploration licences, the Cummins Project and the Harris Greenstone Project, both located in 
the Tier 1 exploration and mining jurisdiction of South Australia.   
Core Energy Minerals Executive Director, Tony Greenaway, said: 
“We are excited to add both of these significant acquisitions in South Australia to Core Energy’s existing portfolio 
of high quality, global uranium exploration assets. 
“The Cummins Project in particular provides Core Energy with multiple advanced drill ready targets, based on 
historic exploration which shows widespread, shallow palaeochannel hosted uranium mineralisation over 
distances of greater than 10km3. As historic exploration was limited to regional 1km spaced drilling, there remains 
strong potential for high-grade mineralised zones of significant strike length to be delineated from the significant 
historic intercepts. The Company plans to validate this historic work with some initial shallow drilling before 
undertaking a more systematic exploration drilling campaign across the wider project area.    
“While the Harris Greenstone Project is less advanced than the Cummins Project, it is located in a region of South 
Australia which hosts multiple world class uranium projects, including the Olympic Dam, Honeymoon and the 
Four Mile uranium mines. Geophysical data covering the Harris Greenstone Project highlights a significant

network of palaeochannels across the project.  These same palaeochannels play host to the Warrior Uranium 
Deposit adjacent to the north of the Harris Greenstone tenements. 
“We are eager to get on the ground in South Australia, where the Cummins Project has targets ready to test, 
while we advance our other earlier-stage assets.” 
 
Overview of South Australian Uranium Projects 
Both the Cummins and Harris Greenstone Projects are located in the Tier 1 exploration and mining district of 
South Australia, which is often considered to be Australia’s most supportive Uranium Mining jurisdiction (Figure 
1) and where Core Energy already holds the Western Eyre Peninsula (“WEP”) Project. 
Figure 1: Project Location map showing the newly acquired Cummins and Harris Greenstone Project relative Core Energy’s 
existing WEP Project, and several existing world class Uranium Mines in South Australia. There is no certainty that further 
work by the Company will lead to achieving the same size, shape, grade, or form of the comparison resources or projects 
noted in this Figure 1. The Company’s projects are in a different stage of development and further exploration needs to be 
undertaken to further prove or disprove any comparison.4 
This region of South Australia hosts several world class operating uranium mines, including the Olympic Dam 
Mine (BHP Group Ltd, ASX:BHP), the Honeymoon Project (Boss Energy, ASX:BOE), and Heathgate’s Four Mile 
Mine. In addition, Alligator Energy (ASX:AGE) is currently advancing its Samphire Uranium Project, where it is

proposing to extract uranium via In-Situ Recovery (“ISR”), from palaeochannels similar in nature to those 
identified in historic drilling on Core Energy’s Cummins Project5. 
Cummins Project, South Australia 
The Cummins Project Area, comprising EL6624, encompasses 952 km2 of highly prospective Uranium tenure 
located on the southern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, a Tier 1 uranium mining jurisdiction with long term pro-
uranium bipartisan government support. 
The Eyre Peninsula is one of the highest radiometric regions of South Australia, host to numerous known uranium 
occurrences and uranium deposits (e.g. Samphire Uranium Deposit, Alligator Energy Ltd (ASX: AGE)) with reduced 
facies tertiary palaeochannels trending through the Cummins Project Area providing ample trap sites for 
remobilised uranium to accumulate. 
The Cummins Project was subject to uranium exploration in the 1970’s by Endeavour Oil Company NL/Le Nickel 
(Australia) Exploration Pty Ltd JV (1973) and Uranerz (Australia) Pty Ltd (1975 – 1976) which identified uranium trap 
sites within the tertiary basin sediments at redox boundaries. Broad, shallow zones, greater than 10km, of 
anomalous gamma were identified from historical drilling and later confirmed by French state-owned uranium 
exploration company Areva in 20096. Redox trap sites in upper and lower units of the tertiary basin are prospective 
for uranium accumulation, as well as possible basement targets. No follow-up uranium exploration has been 
carried out since Areva relinquished its ground in 2014. 
 
5 There is no certainty that further work by the Company will lead to achieving the same size, shape, grade, or form of the comparison resources or 
projects. The Company’s projects are in a different stage of development and further exploration needs to be undertaken to further prove or disprove 
any comparison.

The most advanced target area within the project is the Nunmulta Prospect, just west of the township of Cummins 
(Figure 1) in the northern region of EL6624, providing a drill ready walk-up priority target for first round exploration.  
The Nunmulta Prospect, as identified in the South Australian Geodata Database, is based on Le Nickel (Aust) 
Exploration Pty Ltd, 1972 drill hole Kapi26 with a maximum grade of “613ppm U” and is supported by elevated 
gamma over 750m cross section in follow up holes Kapi 27, 28, 32 AND 337. Follow up drilling in 1975 by Uranerz 
(Australia) Pty Ltd intersected a gamma peak of “134cps equivalent to 0.017% (or 170ppm) U3O8” in drill hole 
U228. Areva Exploration PL from 2010-2014 confirmed broad uranium mineralisation west of Kapi26, with best

intercepts reported in MR006 at 145ppm U from 28m and MR0021 at 182ppm U from 23.6m9 (Figure 3 and  
Figure 4). This work has highlighted a coherent and continuous shallow zone of anomalous uranium 
mineralisation over a distance greater than 10km that represents a compelling high priority drill ready target for 
Core Energy. 
This historic drilling was limited to regional 1km spaced drilling, within the road reserves for ease of access. 
Therefore, there remains a strong potential for high grade mineralised zones of significant strike length to be 
delineated out from the significant historical gamma intercepts, dramatically increasing the overall grade and 
mineralisation footprint.

Proposed Exploration 
During the exploration license transfer process, Core Energy intends to engage with local stakeholders and to 
secure the statutory approvals for ground disturbing exploration activities. In addition, drill programs will be 
prepared to validate historic exploration results and follow up broad spaced drilling in priority target areas.  Upon 
completion of the tenement transfers, low impact, on-ground exploration will begin with surface mapping and 
sampling, with drilling to commence following receipt of the required government approvals.  The Company aims 
to drill test the priority target areas of the Cummins Project within the first half of 2025. 
Note: 
• 
Exploration Results above have been previously reported by the previous explorers as noted in the 
highlighted footnotes. 
• 
As noted above, some historic exploration was undertaken and reported in the mid 1970’s prior to the 
adoption of the JORC code and between 2010-2014. Hence, some of these results may not be reported in 
accordance with the requirements in the JORC Code 2012. 
• 
Core Energy is unable to determine the accuracy of all drilling results from the 1970’s, however Core Energy 
is of the opinion that drilling undertaken by Areva Exploration PL between 2012 -2014 should be reliable 
under current standards.  Historical 1970’s reports list some details of drilling types including RC mud drill 
hole; however no details of hole survey location, sampling or analytical methodology are mentioned.  
Reports do indicate that detailed geological logging of drill cuttings was undertaken. 
• 
Exploration programmes noted in historic records include: reconnaissance drilling by Endeavour Oil Co. NL 
in the early 1970’s and Le Nickel (Aust) Exploration Pty Ltd in 1972, follow-up drilling by Uranerz (Australia) 
PL in 1976, and Mud Rotary drilling and ground-based gravity surveys by Areva Exploration PL between 
2010-2014. 
• 
Core Energy has not identified any additional exploration results or data relevant to understanding these 
Exploration Results. 
• 
Core Energy intends to complete several twin aircore drillholes and detailed analytical testwork on samples 
collected through independent contractors and laboratories to, where possible validate the historic results 
noted above, detailed hole location surveys will be completed for new holes undertaken by Core Energy

and any historic drill collars should they be identified in the field. All new activities undertaken by Core 
Energy will be reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012. 
• 
Core Energy intends to undertake the proposed exploration work within the first half of 2025.   
• 
Core Energy cautions that these reported Exploration Results are historical estimates and: 
○ 
have not been reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; 
○ 
a Competent Person has not done sufficient work to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance 
with the JORC Code 2012; 
○ 
it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration work that the Exploration Results 
will be able to be reported as mineral resources or ore reservices under the JORC Cade 2012; 
○ 
nothing has come to the attention of Core Energy that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability 
of the former owner's Exploration Results; but 
○ 
Core Energy has not independently validated the former owner's Exploration Results and therefore 
is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results. 
Harris Greenstone Project, South Australia 
The Harris Greenstone Project, consists of two exploration licences EL6578 and EL6579, encompassing 1,350km2 
of virtually unexplored extensive palaeochannel systems located in the central Gawler Craton, South Australia (). 
The nearby Warrior Uranium Deposit (1.48Mlb U3O8 at 700ppm12 only 23km away) and Kingoonya palaeovalleys 
trend into the Harris Greenstone Project project area (Figure 5) and supports the potential for a tertiary 
palaeochannel hosted uranium deposit.  
Critical elements such as Hiltaba Suite Granites (potential source rocks), large regional structures (fluid conduits 
and zones of deep basement weathering) and reduced tertiary palaeochannels (redox trap sites) that allowed the 
formation of the Warrior Uranium Deposit, all exist within the Harris Greenstone Project Area indicating a high 
prospectivity for uranium mineralisation13. 
Core Energy has inherited a first-class geophysical dataset, including magnetics and VTEM which has defined the 
basement structures, geology and palaeochannel system within the project area that are ideal for drill targeting. 
Native Title Mining 9b Access Agreements are already in place for the project, which is expected to expedite 
access to on ground exploration and drilling by up to 12 months. 
Proposed Exploration 
Core Energy Limited intends to immediately begin the transfer process for title and the Native Title 9b Access 
Agreements. During this time, target prioritisation and on ground exploration programs will be prepared for 
regulatory submission/approvals (Exploration Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation – EPEPR). 
The Company aims to quickly be in a position to drill test the Harris Greenstone Project uranium potential.

in a different stage of development and further exploration needs to be undertaken to further prove or disprove any comparison.

(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld 
XRF instruments, etc). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
• Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases 
more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg 
submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
Endeavour Oil Company NL/Le Nickel 
(Australia) Exploration Pty Ltd JV 
• Neltronic Porta Logger (hired/borrowed) from 
the South Aust. Dept Mines and Energy was 
used to log self potential, radioactivity 
(gamma) and single point resistivity. 
• Down hole gamma logs were used to identify 
mineralised zones. Each gamma ray log was 
systematically run on the 20 counts/sec/cm 
scale over the total depth, then rerun at higher 
scales where required; average cable speed 
was 3m/minute. From the down hole gamma 
counts per second (cps), a conversion formula 
based on grade calibrations of the gamma tool 
were applied to determine ppm or % eU3O8. A 
conversion of 1200counts/sec = 875ppm 
eU3O8 was applied. These results are used by 
CR3 as an indication for exploration targeting 
rather than reliable grade data. 
• Drill cuttings were sampled in 3’ composites, 
geologically logged and assayed.  Rotary mud 
drill cuttings are considered to be very poor 
quality samples, qualitative rather than 
quantitative. 
• 6.10m of side wall sampling of Kapi 26 were 
taken of the anomalous gamma zone after 
triple tube coring method failed to return a 
sufficient sample. Side wall sample method 
provides samples which are neither sufficient 
in volume nor representative. These results 
are used by CR3 as an indication for 
exploration targeting rather than reliable grade 
data.

known, considering the deposit type. 
• If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to 
have introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if 
material. 
• Anomalous gamma zone is horizontal. All drill 
holes are appropriately orientated, drilled 
vertically. 
Sample 
security 
• The measures taken to ensure sample 
security. 
• All results are from historical data. Sample 
security cannot be verified. 
Audits or 
reviews 
• The results of any audits or reviews of 
sampling techniques and data. 
• Sample results have not been audited.

Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style 
of mineralisation. 
• Deposit style is tertiary palaeochannel hosted 
uranium with potential for calcrete style 
uranium and basement hosted, metasomatic 
style uranium.  
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all information material to 
the understanding of the exploration 
results including a tabulation of the 
following information for all Material drill 
holes: 
o easting and northing of the drill hole 
collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in metres) 
of the drill hole collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o down hole length and interception 
depth 
o hole length. 
• If the exclusion of this information is 
justified on the basis that the information 
is not Material and this exclusion does 
not detract from the understanding of 
the report, the Competent Person 
should clearly explain why this is the 
case. 
• Drill hole details are located within Appendix 1 
of the ASX release. Elevation data is not 
reported within the South Australia Geobase 
Database for the U prefixed drill holes 
(Uranerz) and the Kapi prefixed drill holes 
(Endeavour Oil NL / Le Nickel (Australia)

aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (eg cutting of high grades) 
and cut-off grades are usually Material

short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should 
be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting 
of metal equivalent values should be 
clearly stated. 
No data aggregation methods are used.

• AREVA grade data tabulated in Appendix 4 is 
reported as grade (ppm eU3O8) x thickness (m) 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, 
its nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down 
hole length, true width not known’). 
• All drill holes reported with in this ASX release 
are drilled vertically. Sedimentary hosted 
mineralisation is horizontal/tabular. 
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view 
of drill hole collar locations and 
appropriate sectional views. 
• All appropriate diagrams are included within 
the ASX release attached. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting 
of Exploration Results. 
• All historical drill holes, their historically 
reported results and details, reviewed by this 
release are detailed in the Appendices 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful 
and material, should be reported 
including (but not limited to): geological 
observations; geophysical survey 
results; geochemical survey results; bulk 
samples – size and method of treatment; 
metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• CR3 has not yet reviewed all available 
historical information 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further 
work (eg tests for lateral extensions or 
depth extensions or large-scale step-out 
drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas 
of possible extensions, including the 
• Completion of literature review 
• Obtain on-ground access through stakeholder 
engagement and regulatory approval 
• Review of geophysics requirements 
• Drilling to confirm historical results, extend
