STAGED OPTION AGREEMENT TO
ACQUIRE TWO HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN URANIUM PROJECTS
Highlights
• Core Energy Minerals enters into options to acquire up to a 100% interest in the Cummins Project and
Harris Greenstone Project, two highly prospective uranium projects, covering a combined area of
over 2,300km2 in the Tier 1 uranium exploration and mining jurisdiction of South Australia.
• Historic drilling results at the 952km2 Cummins Project show widespread palaeochannel hosted
uranium mineralisation over a distance of approximately 10 kilometres and similar in nature to the
nearby Alligator Energy (ASX: AGE) 17.5Mlbs U3O8 Samphire Project1.
• The 1,350km2 Harris Greenstone Project covers unexplored extensions of the well-defined
palaeochannels hosting nearby 1.48Mlb Warrior Uranium Deposit2, with Native Title 9B access
agreement already in place enabling fast tracked on-ground exploration.
• On-ground exploration including mapping, confirmatory drilling and geophysical surveys at the
Cummins Project is planned to commence in Q1 2025, with drilling proposed to commence
immediately following receipt of statutory approvals.
Core Energy Minerals Limited (ASX:CR3) (“Core Energy” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the signing
of two binding staged option agreements to acquire up to a 100% interest in two uranium projects comprising a
total of 3 granted exploration licences, the Cummins Project and the Harris Greenstone Project, both located in
the Tier 1 exploration and mining jurisdiction of South Australia.
Core Energy Minerals Executive Director, Tony Greenaway, said:
“We are excited to add both of these significant acquisitions in South Australia to Core Energy’s existing portfolio
of high quality, global uranium exploration assets.
“The Cummins Project in particular provides Core Energy with multiple advanced drill ready targets, based on
historic exploration which shows widespread, shallow palaeochannel hosted uranium mineralisation over
distances of greater than 10km3. As historic exploration was limited to regional 1km spaced drilling, there remains
strong potential for high-grade mineralised zones of significant strike length to be delineated from the significant
historic intercepts. The Company plans to validate this historic work with some initial shallow drilling before
undertaking a more systematic exploration drilling campaign across the wider project area.
“While the Harris Greenstone Project is less advanced than the Cummins Project, it is located in a region of South
Australia which hosts multiple world class uranium projects, including the Olympic Dam, Honeymoon and the
Four Mile uranium mines. Geophysical data covering the Harris Greenstone Project highlights a significant

Deposit adjacent to the north of the Harris Greenstone tenements.
“We are eager to get on the ground in South Australia, where the Cummins Project has targets ready to test,
while we advance our other earlier-stage assets.”
Overview of South Australian Uranium Projects
Both the Cummins and Harris Greenstone Projects are located in the Tier 1 exploration and mining district of
South Australia, which is often considered to be Australia’s most supportive Uranium Mining jurisdiction (Figure
1) and where Core Energy already holds the Western Eyre Peninsula (“WEP”) Project.

existing WEP Project, and several existing world class Uranium Mines in South Australia. There is no certainty that further work
by the Company will lead to achieving the same size, shape, grade, or form of the comparison resources or projects noted in
this Figure 1. The Company’s projects are in a different stage of development and further exploration needs to be undertaken
to further prove or disprove any comparison.4
This region of South Australia hosts several world class operating uranium mines, including the Olympic Dam
Mine (BHP Group Ltd, ASX:BHP), the Honeymoon Project (Boss Energy, ASX:BOE), and Heathgate’s Four Mile
Mine. In addition, Alligator Energy (ASX:AGE) is currently advancing its Samphire Uranium Project, where it is

proposing to extract uranium via In-Situ Recovery (“ISR”), from palaeochannels similar in nature to those
identified in historic drilling on Core Energy’s Cummins Project5.
Cummins Project, South Australia
The Cummins Project Area, comprising EL6624, encompasses 952 km2 of highly prospective Uranium tenure
located on the southern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, a Tier 1 uranium mining jurisdiction with long term pro-
uranium bipartisan government support ().
The Eyre Peninsula is one of the highest radiometric regions of South Australia, host to numerous known uranium
occurrences and uranium deposits (e.g. Samphire Uranium Deposit, Alligator Energy Ltd (ASX: AGE)) with reduced
facies tertiary palaeochannels trending through the Cummins Project Area providing ample trap sites for
remobilised uranium to accumulate.
The Cummins Project was subject to uranium exploration in the 1970’s by Endeavour Oil Company NL/Le Nickel
(Australia) Exploration Pty Ltd JV (1973) and Uranerz (Australia) Pty Ltd (1975 – 1976) which identified uranium trap
sites within the tertiary basin sediments at redox boundaries. Broad, shallow zones, greater than 10km, of
anomalous gamma were identified from historical drilling and later confirmed by French state-owned uranium
exploration company Areva in 20096. Redox trap sites in upper and lower units of the tertiary basin are prospective
for uranium accumulation, as well as possible basement targets. No follow-up uranium exploration has been
carried out since Areva relinquished its ground in 2014.
5 There is no certainty that further work by the Company will lead to achieving the same size, shape, grade, or form of the comparison resources or
projects. The Company’s projects are in a different stage of development and further exploration needs to be undertaken to further prove or disprove
any comparison.

The most advanced target area within the project is the Nunmulta Prospect, just west of the township of Cummins
(Figure 1) in the northern region of EL6624, providing a drill ready walk-up priority target for first round exploration.
The Nunmulta Prospect, as identified in the South Australian Geodata Database, is based on Le Nickel (Aust)
Exploration Pty Ltd, 1972 drill hole Kapi26 with a maximum grade of “613ppm U” and is supported by elevated
gamma over 750m cross section in follow up holes Kapi 27, 28, 32 AND 337. Follow up drilling in 1975 by Uranerz
(Australia) Pty Ltd intersected a gamma peak of “134cps equivalent to 0.017% (or 170ppm) U3O8” in drill hole
U228. Areva Exploration PL from 2010-2014 confirmed broad uranium mineralisation west of Kapi26, with best
intercepts reported in MR006 at 145ppm U from 28m and MR0021 at 182ppm U from 23.6m9 (Figure 2 and

mineralisation over a distance greater than 10km that represents a compelling high priority drill ready target for
Core Energy.
This historic drilling was limited to regional 1km spaced drilling, within the road reserves for ease of access.
Therefore, there remains a strong potential for high grade mineralised zones of significant strike length to be
delineated out from the significant historical gamma intercepts, dramatically increasing the overall grade and
mineralisation footprint.

Proposed Exploration
During the exploration license transfer process, Core Energy intends to engage with local stakeholders and to
secure the statutory approvals for ground disturbing exploration activities. In addition, drill programs will be
prepared to validate historic exploration results and follow up broad spaced drilling in priority target areas. Upon
completion of the tenement transfers, low impact, on-ground exploration will begin with surface mapping and
sampling, with drilling to commence following receipt of the required government approvals. The Company aims
to drill test the priority target areas of the Cummins Project within the first half of 2025.
Note:
• Exploration Results above have been previously reported by the previous explorers as noted in the
highlighted footnotes.
• As noted above, some historic exploration was undertaken and reported in the mid 1970’s prior to the
adoption of the JORC code and between 2010-2014. Hence, some of these results may not be reported in
accordance with the requirements in the JORC Code 2012.
• Core Energy is unable to determine the accuracy of all drilling results from the 1970’s, however Core Energy
is of the opinion that drilling undertaken by Areva Exploration PL between 2012 -2014 should be reliable
under current standards. Historical 1970’s reports list some details of drilling types including RC mud drill
hole; however no details of hole survey location, sampling or analytical methodology are mentioned.
Reports do indicate that detailed geological logging of drill cuttings was undertaken.
• Exploration programmes noted in historic records include: reconnaissance drilling by Endeavour Oil Co. NL
in the early 1970’s and Le Nickel (Aust) Exploration Pty Ltd in 1972, follow-up drilling by Uranerz (Australia)
PL in 1976, and Mud Rotary drilling and ground-based gravity surveys by Areva Exploration PL between
2010-2014.
• Core Energy has not identified any additional exploration results or data relevant to understanding these
Exploration Results.
• Core Energy intends to complete several twin aircore drillholes and detailed analytical testwork on samples
collected through independent contractors and laboratories to, where possible validate the historic results
noted above, detailed hole location surveys will be completed for new holes undertaken by Core Energy

and any historic drill collars should they be identified in the field. All new activities undertaken by Core
Energy will be reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012.
• Core Energy intends to undertake the proposed exploration work within the first half of 2025.
• Core Energy cautions that these reported Exploration Results are historical estimates and:
○ have not been reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012;
○ a Competent Person has not done sufficient work to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance
with the JORC Code 2012;
○ it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration work that the Exploration Results
will be able to be reported as mineral resources or ore reservices under the JORC Cade 2012;
○ nothing has come to the attention of Core Energy that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability
of the former owner's Exploration Results; but
○ Core Energy has not independently validated the former owner's Exploration Results and therefore
is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results.
Harris Greenstone Project, South Australia
The Harris Greenstone Project, consists of two exploration licences EL6578 and EL6579, encompassing 1,350km2
of virtually unexplored extensive palaeochannel systems located in the central Gawler Craton, South Australia ().
The nearby Warrior Uranium Deposit (1.48Mlb U O at 700ppm12 only 23km away) and Kingoonya palaeovalleys
3 8
trend into the Harris Greenstone Project project area (Figure 4) and supports the potential for a tertiary
palaeochannel hosted uranium deposit.
Critical elements such as Hiltaba Suite Granites (potential source rocks), large regional structures (fluid conduits
and zones of deep basement weathering) and reduced tertiary palaeochannels (redox trap sites) that allowed the
formation of the Warrior Uranium Deposit, all exist within the Harris Greenstone Project Area indicating a high
prospectivity for uranium mineralisation14.
Core Energy has inherited a first-class geophysical dataset, including magnetics and VTEM which has defined the
basement structures, geology and palaeochannel system within the project area that are ideal for drill targeting.
Native Title Mining 9b Access Agreements are already in place for the project, which is expected to expedite
access to on ground exploration and drilling by up to 12 months.
Proposed Exploration
Core Energy Limited intends to immediately begin the transfer process for title and the Native Title 9b Access
Agreements. During this time, target prioritisation and on ground exploration programs will be prepared for
regulatory submission/approvals (Exploration Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation – EPEPR).
The Company aims to quickly be in a position to drill test the Harris Greenstone Project uranium potential.
