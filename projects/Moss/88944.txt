#  Mako Mining Receives Conditional Approval for the Acquisition of the Moss Mine in Arizona

**VANCOUVER, BC /[ACCESS Newswire](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) / February 24, 2025 / ****Mako Mining Corp.** (TSX-V:MKO)(OTCQX:MAKOF) ("**Mako** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to provide an update on Mako's proposed acquisition (the "**Acquisition** ") of the Moss Mine in Arizona, through the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of EG Acquisition LLC ("**EGA** ") from investment funds (the "**Sellers** ") controlled by Mako's controlling shareholder, Wexford Capital LP ("**Wexford** "). Mako is pleased to announce that it has received the conditional approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the "**TSXV** ") for the Acquisition. Completion of the Acquisition remains subject to Mako satisfying all regulatory requirements and receiving the final approval of the TSXV. Mako is concurrently working on finalizing a definitive share purchase agreement with the Sellers in connection with the Acquisition.

EGA took over full operational control of the Moss Mine on December 31st, 2024, and has a services contract with Mako's operating team who has been assisting EGA. Since that time, consumable inventories have been replenished, critical maintenance has been completed, and a scope of work has been issued to mining contractors to restart mining operations within the next five weeks.

Since January 2025, gold and silver sales from the Moss Mine have continued unabated with 832 oz. gold and 5,607 oz. silver shipped with an estimated value of US$2.6 million. This significantly exceeds a US$1.6 million cash infusion made by EGA into the operating company at the beginning of January for critical maintenance and repairs.

While the previously announced non-binding term sheet for the Acquisition (see December 31, 2024 press release) contemplates a purchase price of between US$4.9 million and US$6.4 million (dependent on whether certain royalties are extinguished), all the net cashflow derived from gold and silver sales since December 31st, 2024 will accrue to the benefit of Mako under the proposed terms of the Acquisition. In addition, Mako is expected to receive approximately US$1.5 million in cash collateral from Trisura Guarantee Insurance Company in connection with the renegotiation of certain environmental reclamation bonds at the Moss Mine, which will have the impact of lowering the effective purchase price of the Acquisition by such amount.

On behalf of the Board,

**Akiba Leisman**  
**Chief Executive Officer**
