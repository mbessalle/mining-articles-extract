ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 19 March 2025
TRIGG EXPANDS TIER-1 AUSTRALIAN ANTIMONY-GOLD TENURE
WITH GRADES UP TO 61% Sb & 1045 g/t Au
New acquisition complements Trigg’s flagship WCC deposit and the Company’s vision
to become a primary antimony play and future global supplier of antimony
HIGHLIGHTS
• Trigg Minerals signs a binding purchase agreement to acquire 100% rights of the Nundle,
Upper Hunter, Cobark/Copeland projects, conditional upon completion of due diligence.
Covering a total area of 1,039.7 km².
• These projects will be developed as Trigg’s second flagship exploration asset behind its
primary, advanced stage high-grade Wild Cattle Creek deposit. Trigg will have two
exploration teams advancing both these new projects and Wild Cattle Creek
simultaneously.
• The package includes five historical antimony deposits, with rock chips grading 61% Sb
and 9.7% Sb, and 12 tonnes of recorded Sb production (EL 9594, Nundle), plus a 37% Sb
sample collected from 12m down adit indicating potential mineralisation at depth (EL
9655, Upper Hunter).
• The tenements also feature 60+ historical gold mines/occurrences across each tenement
with historical recorded high-grade production. As an example, Standard Reef was worked
in 1904 with an estimated production of 15,000oz at 53.8 g/t Au.
• Total historical production across the tenement package is estimated at 174,000 oz Au
without modern mining techniques and significantly lower gold prices. Initial review
suggests that mineralisation is interpreted to be open along strike and down depth and
with considerable high grade rock chip grades ranging from 30 g/t Au to 1,045 g/t Au.
• The addition of the Nundle Project to TMG’s North Nundle holdings extends the
Company’s prospective strike along the underexplored and prolific Peel Fault to
approximately 40 km, significantly enhancing exploration potential.
Trigg Minerals Limited (ASX: TMG; OTCQB: TMGLF) ("Trigg" or the "Company") is pleased to
announce the acquisition of the Nundle, Upper Hunter and Cobark/Copeland Projects, a
highly prospective tenement package covering a significant portion of the historic Nundle
Goldfield and three additional historic goldfields within the New England Orogen (NEO) in
northern New South Wales.

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 19 March 2025
The acquisition includes four key projects:
Nundle (EL 9594)
The Nundle Goldfield has a rich history of gold production, with several historical antimony
mines present within the region. It covers parts of the major Peel Fault and contains
numerous old workings where typically small high-grade gold deposits occur in dolerites. The
expanded Nundle Project, encompassing both Nundle and North Nundle, provides Trigg
access to a 40 km length of the Peel Fault, a deep-seated conduit for mineralising fluids,
controlling the localisation of auriferous (gold-bearing) quartz veins and antimony deposits.
Several historical goldfields, including Nundle, Hanging Rock, and Bingara, are closely
associated with this fault system.
Upper Hunter (EL 9655)
The Upper Hunter Goldfield in NSW is a historic gold-producing region known for its
structurally controlled, quartz-vein-hosted gold deposits. Mineralisation occurs in fault
breccia and shear zones within sedimentary rocks, with gold typically found alongside pyrite,
arsenopyrite, minor chalcopyrite, and, locally, stibnite (antimony).
Cobark and Copeland (EL 9653)
The Cobark and Copeland Goldfields in NSW were prominent during the late 1800s gold rush.
Mining focused on high-grade quartz veins hosted in faults and shear zones. The Copeland
area became a key mining hub, with underground workings targeting gold-rich sulphides such
as pyrite, stibnite (antimony), arsenopyrite, and minor chalcopyrite. The region remains highly
prospective for modern exploration.
The association of antimony mineralisation with gold enhances the project's critical mineral
potential, aligning with Trigg Minerals’ strategy to explore and develop high-value, multi-
commodity assets in Tier-1 mining jurisdictions.
STRATEGIC RATIONALE
The Projects are in an underexplored yet highly prospective region, with historical workings
and strong geological indicators suggesting significant upside potential. The presence of both
gold and antimony presents an exciting opportunity for Trigg to unlock new resources and
expand its footprint in the strategic metals sector.
Tim Morrison, Executive Chairman of Trigg Minerals, commented:
“The acquisition of the Nundle and other Projects marks an exciting expansion for Trigg
Minerals into historically productive goldfields with strong critical mineral potential. The
presence of both gold and antimony in this underexplored region aligns perfectly with our
focus on high-value, strategically significant minerals. We look forward to applying modern
exploration techniques to uncover new opportunities within this proven mineral province.”

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 19 March 2025
Trigg Minerals will undertake a systematic exploration program, leveraging historical data and
modern exploration methodologies to assess the potential for high-grade gold and antimony
mineralisation across the tenement package.
This acquisition reinforces Trigg Minerals' commitment to building a diverse, high-quality
asset portfolio and advancing projects with strong potential for gold and critical mineral
resources in Australia’s premier mining regions.
GEOLOGY AND MINERALISATION
The Nundle-Bingara belt hosts the most significant clusters of deposits, occurring adjacent to
the Peel Fault or its subsidiary structures. These major dislocations appear to have controlled
regional-scale fluid flow, while local structures determined the final emplacement of
mineralisation.
Similarly, in the Copeland-Barrington goldfield, which includes the Upper Hunter, Copeland
and Cobark Projects, gold-bearing veins are structurally controlled by faulting related to the
Peel Fault system, with most mines clustered near a fold hinge and within Riedel shears.
Across both regions, deposits typically occur within faults, shears, or joints, forming simple or
multi-phase vein fillings. The veins consist primarily of quartz, with varying amounts of gold,
sulphides (mainly stibnite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite), or scheelite, while ankerite or calcite is
commonly present as late-stage infill.
The gold-antimony veins strongly prefer metasediments, volcanics, and serpentinite adjacent
to major structural dislocations, reinforcing the importance of fault-controlled fluid flow in
ore deposition. The surface distribution of deposits suggests a regional east-west zoning, with
a thin, poorly defined scheelite belt, a central gold belt, and a stibnite belt, all broadly
concordant with host rock bedding.
Three historical antimony mines—Stanning’s, Woodley’s, and Fogarty’s—are located within 2
km of each other in the Tamworth Group sediments in the Nundle area. These deposits are
hosted in cherty argillites, occurring higher in the Tamworth Group stratigraphy than the gold-
quartz vein-bearing units. A fourth stibnite deposit, documented by Odernheimer (1855a, b),
was reportedly located near Silver Gully, north of this deposit group. Antimony occurs as
stibnite in short, steeply pitching ore shoots within breccia zones, both with and without
quartz. Minor gold (up to 10 g/t in stibnite) and occasional scheelite mineralisation are also
present.
Traces of scheelite (an important tungsten ore) are present in several gold- and stibnite-
bearing reefs, though significant concentrations have only been identified in and around
Zwer’s Scheelite Mine (164). This deposit consists of a quartz-scheelite vein hosted in dolerite
and is located well away from any known gold deposits. Minor scheelite occurrences have
also been recorded at the Rip and Tear Scheelite Prospect (201) and Fogarty’s Antimony Mine
(179).
