(<i>TSX: CG) (NYSE: CGAU)&#160;</i>(\"Centerra\"), are pleased to announce the signing of an agreement to acquire the Mary Anne group of patented claims located adjacent to the 100% controlled Cherry Creek Project in eastern White Pine County, Nevada.  The agreement was signed with Southwest Land and Minerals Corp. of Reno, Nevada.</p><p>The property is comprised of 24 patented claims commonly known as the Mary Anne claim group.

Ore was developed on a mineralized quartz vein system at or near the contact between the Prospect Mountain Quartzite and the Cherry Creek Quartz Monzonite. The vein system is dominated by silver mineralization accompanied by values in copper, lead and gold.  There are no current estimates of remaining reserve potential.  </p><p>Mark Abrams, Viscount VP of Exploration, stated: \"These additional patented claims are an important addition to our district play at Cherry Creek. Non-compliant historic sampling suggests mineralization may extend from the mined veins into the quartz monzonite wall rock.  This presents the potential for bulk tonnage mineralization in addition to vein targets in the area of the historic mines.  The property history is quite unique in that both Presidents Roosevelt and Taft signed the patent documents for some of the claims.\"</p><p>The Company is also pleased to announce the appointment of Scott Davis CPA, CGA, as our new CFO. Mr. Davis is a partner of Vancouver-based Cross Davis &#38; Company LLP Chartered Professional Accountants.  The firm is focused on providing accounting and management services for publicly-listed companies.  Mr. Davis has extensive accounting and finance experience dealing with the complexities of both private and public corporations in a variety of industries.  </p><p>Derick Sinclair, Viscount's CFO since inception is retiring but will take an advisory role position with the company. Jim MacKenzie, Viscount CEO, stated, \"The Board of Viscount would like to thank Derick for his valuable contribution to the company and we wish him well in his retirement.

It is located 44 miles WSW of Pueblo, Colorado, and has year-around access by paved road. The property consists of 96 lode claims where high grade silver, gold, and base metal production came from numerous mines during the period 1878 to the early 1900's. The property underwent substantial exploration between 1967 and 1984. The property is interpreted to encompass a portion of a large caldera and a highly altered sequence of tertiary rhyolitic flows and fragmental units which offers the potential to host deposits with both precious and base metals. This has been demonstrated in the mineralization historically extracted from the numerous underground and surface mining operations. Based on the accumulated data and feasibility study, Tenneco Minerals made the decision with silver at $5.00 USD an ounce to construct at that time a $35,000,000 USD milling operation for the extraction of the silver reserves at Silver Cliff. Shortly thereafter Tenneco's Mining Unit was sold, and the planned milling operation was abandoned.</p><p>The Cherry Creek exploration property is in an area commonly known as the Cherry Creek Mining District, located approximately 50 miles north of the town of Ely, White Pine County, Nevada. Cherry Creek consists of 578 unpatented and 41 patented claims as well as mill rights. Cherry Creek includes more than 20 past-producing mines. In January 2021, Viscount entered an exploration earn-in agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Centerra Gold Inc.
