# Americas Gold and Silver Closes Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Galena Complex; Appoints New Directors to the Board

TORONTO--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSX: USA) (NYSE American: USAS) (“Americas” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has closed the acquisition of the remaining 40% interest in the Galena Complex (“Galena”) in Idaho, USA (the “Transaction”) from an affiliate of Eric Sprott ("Sprott"). 

> Pursuant to the Transaction, shareholders of Sprott affiliates received an aggregate of 169,999,998 common shares of the Company. In addition, Americas paid US$10 million in cash and will provide monthly silver deliveries of 18,500 ounces for a period of 36 months starting in January 2026 to affiliate of Sprott. 

As part of the Transaction, the Company issued an aggregate of 294,999,998 shares of the Company to various parties, including pursuant to the exchange of 125,000,000 subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”) for common shares of the Company, which were issued on a private placement basis on October 30, 2024 for gross proceeds of C$50 million, a portion of which was used to fund the cash purchase price of US$10 million payable pursuant to the Transaction. Each Subscription Receipt was automatically exchanged in accordance with their terms, without payment of additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holders thereof, for one common share in the capital of the Company. The common shares issued pursuant to the Transaction are subject to a four-month hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws. 

“I would like to thank our shareholders for supporting the acquisition of the remaining 40% interest in the Galena Complex. We are very excited about the transaction as it consolidates an asset with a tremendous team and resource base and positions the Company to benefit in an anticipated strong silver price environment," said Paul Andre Huet, Americas’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “With the proceeds of the private placement and the anticipated restructuring of our existing debt obligations, I am extremely excited for the shareholders of Americas moving forward.” 

"I would like to sincerely thank outgoing Chairman Alex Davidson and the other retiring Americas board members including Alan Edwards, Manuel Rivera and Christine Carson for their numerous contributions to the Company over the years; without their support, it would have been difficult to get to the closing of this exciting transaction," stated Darren Blasutti, Americas’ President.
