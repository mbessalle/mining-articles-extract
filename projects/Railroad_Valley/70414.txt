# Pure Energy Signs Letter of Intent to Option Railroad Valley Property from Ameriwest Lithium Inc

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 4, 2024) - **Pure Energy Minerals Ltd. (TSXV: PE) (OTCQB: PEMIF)** ("Pure Energy" or "the Company") is pleased to announce that it has signed a Letter of Intent ("LOI") dated August 30, 2024 to acquire up to an 85% interest in the Railroad Valley Property (the "Property"), located in Nye County, Nevada, from Ameriwest Lithium Inc. ("Ameriwest" or "AWLI"). The Property comprises 563 placer mineral claims granted by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"), and is well situated for exploration for lithium-bearing brines.

Pure Energy's LOI with Ameriwest provides for the following terms over six years: 

  * Initial earn-in option over three years to earn a 65% interest in the Property by expenditures in cash and shares of $450,000, plus project expenditures of USD$1.0 million;
  * Second Option over two years to earn-in to a 75% interest in the Property by expenditures of an additional $500,000 in shares and cash, plus project expenditures of USD$1.5 million;
  * Third Option over one year to earn-in to a 85% interest by US$1.0 million in cash and shares, and project expenditures of USD$1,000,000.



The 11,201 acre (4,533 hectare) Property is a green fields lithium brine exploration target located in Railroad Valley, Nevada. The North Railroad Valley drainage basin is larger in size and has geologic characteristics to host a lithium brine deposit similar to the one found in Clayton Valley, Nevada, located just 125 mi to the west-southwest. Clayton Valley currently hosts the most advanced and largest lithium-brine pilot plant in the United States, developed at Pure Energy Minerals' Clayton Valley property with our partner, which is currently in operation to produce lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). Clayton Valley also hosts the Silver Peak lithium brine mine operated by Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB). Similarities of the RRV Property to Clayton Valley do not guarantee exploration success at RRV.

Ameriwest has defined a large lithium brine exploration target in the southwestern end of North Railroad Valley. The target is based on gravity, magnetotelluric, and seismic geophysics studies completed by Ameriwest, along with available historic oil well drilling logs and seismic data. Drilling is required next to confirm the presence of a lithium bearing brine, and no mineral resources or reserves have yet been defined on the property. The transaction is subject to the entering into of a definitive agreement and approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.

"Pure Energy is pleased to add the Railroad Valley property to its exploration focus, as it shows a number of important markers for lithium brine potential," remarked Joseph Mullin, CEO of Pure Energy Minerals. "We look forward to collaboration with Ameriwest in the exploration of the RRV property, and to continue our efforts in the battery metals arena."
