STRATEGIC RATIONALE
• Established production platform: The Henty Gold Mine is an established gold production
platform, with historical production of 1.4Moz @ 8.9g/t. Since acquiring Henty in 2021, Catalyst
has made significant operational improvements and investments at Henty, including drill
platforms, drilling, tailings, underground fleet and people.
• 5-year mine plan: Work to date has culminated in establishing a robust 5-year mine plan
underpinned by a current Ore Reserves of 1.2Mt @ 4.0g/t for 154koz. There is significant
scope to extent mine life based on the current Mineral Resource of 4.1Mt @ 3.4g/t Au for
449koz along with the considerable opportunities for near-mine exploration and development
success.
• Significant infrastructure: There is significant infrastructure in place at the Henty Gold Mine
including a 300ktpa CIL processing plant, surface & underground workshops, administration
complex, access to hydro generated grid power and refreshed tailings storage capacity.
• Implement and build on operational capacity: Key Kaiser executives have significant
experience in the optimisation of similar assets to Henty achieved through a combination of
operational improvement and targeted exploration investment. The support from Catalyst as a
19.99% strategic shareholder, along with the addition of the Henty site operating team, a stable
& skilled local workforce of +150 employees, will further strengthen the Kaiser team.
• Flagship asset: With the Henty Gold Mine as its flagship asset, the Kaiser team will provide
dedicated focus to continue the significant work completed by Catalyst and further drive
operational improvements at Henty.
• Significant increase to Kaiser’s gold production: the acquisition of the Henty Gold Mine will
immediately transform Kaiser into a multi-asset gold producer with +30koz of annual production.

providing the Company with enhanced financial flexibility for further reinvestment, exploration,
debt reduction or return to shareholders. The current record gold price environment provides
Kaiser with an excellent opportunity to generate strong margins from an operation that has
historically held a stable cost base.
• Re-rating potential: The total upfront consideration of A$31.6 million reflects an acquisition
metric of less than A$1,200 per production ounce4. Given the current trading range of small ASX
gold producers on an EV/Production basis, the Transaction represents excellent value and a
potential re-rating opportunity for Kaiser shareholders.
Kaiser’s Managing Director, Jonathan Downes said:
“We are excited to significantly expand Kaiser’s production base, exploration opportunities and enter
into a strategic partnership with Catalyst in Victoria. We look forward to welcoming the Henty team
into Kaiser and growing the business together.
“Catalyst has done a great job building a profitable operation at Henty over the last 4 years, with
clear production and mine life visibility, plus some great exploration targets. Kaiser will continue to
re-invest into Henty and build on what Catalyst has already achieved. We are very pleased to have
Catalyst’s continued involvement and exposure to the upside at Henty, both as Kaiser’s major
shareholder and through their board representation.
“The option for Kaiser and Catalyst to enter into a 50/50 JV partnership at the Maldon processing
plant gives both parties a clear pathway that supports their Victorian ambitions. A Joint Venture can
unlock the benefits that would come with plant expansion and increased operational scale, and we
look forward to working with Catalyst as JV partners if they execute the option.
“I’m also pleased that Brad Valiukas will be taking a full-time role with Kaiser as Director –
Operations. Brad has a wealth of experience in underground mining and helping to grow companies
such as Mincor Resources, to their peak period operating 8 mines, and Northern Star, bedding in
assets from Newmont, Barrick and Sumitomo. Brad has been instrumental in the changes we have
made over the last few months at A1, accelerating the capital development to get below historic
workings and setting A1 up to deliver going forward.
“The addition of Henty to our portfolio, alongside A1 in Victoria, positions Kaiser as a >30,000oz old
producer and targeting 50,000 ounces of gold production per annum in the short term. Each of the
gold projects provides expansion and exploration opportunities and collectively positions Kaiser for
a market re-rating in line with our peers. The value metrics of Kaiser are compelling with three gold
mines (one on care and maintenance) and two gold processing plants – all held with an enterprise
value of A$67 million.”
MATERIAL AGREEMENTS
Kaiser and its subsidiary have entered into a number of agreements in respect to the Transaction
and Auramet funding. Please see Appendix 6 for further details on each of these agreements.

Appendix 1: Project Overviews
Henty Gold Mine Overview
Henty is located in a world-class mineral province, hosting high-grade multi-commodity mines in
northwest Tasmania. Henty commenced operations in 1996 and has since produced approximately
1.4 million ounces of gold at mined grade of approximately 9 g/t. The project also includes a strategic
underexplored tenement package with 25 kilometres of strike along the Henty fault.
Operations consist of an underground mine accessed via a decline. Primary mining methods are
long hole bench stoping, traverse open stoping and cut and fill stoping, Henty is an owner-operated
operation utilising a local and regional drive-in and drive-out workforce.
Processing is via a conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) processing plant with the capacity to treat up
to 300,000tpa. Processing achieves high recoveries (generally +90%) and produces a high-quality
gold doré.

Appendix 3: Henty Resource and Reserve Material Information Summary
HENTY GOLD MINE, TASMANIA
Material information summary as required under ASX Listing Rule 5.16 and 5.17.
Mining
Henty has been in operation for 28 years, whereby various mining methods have been used in the
past (room and pillar, longhole open stoping with paste fill/ rock fill or no fill). The mining method
used for the mining plan is a combination of longhole stoping and benching.
Stope designs assume a minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 10m and stope
height to a maximum of 15m. The intervals vary from 12-15m, which is deemed an appropriate
method for control of dilution, reduction of pillars and ore loss, ground control, safety and regional
stability. Dilution of 15% is applied to the in-situ stope ore tonnes and the ore recovery of 92-95% is
applied, depending on extraction method.
Unclassified and inferred material have not been included within the Ore Reserves, however if the
material is mined as a consequence to mining an Ore Reserve stope, then material had a zero-grade
assigned and was therefore treated as dilution waste.
Processing
Henty’s process plant has an annual plant capacity of 300,000 tonnes and comprises a semi-
autogenous mill (SAG) feeding a conventional carbon-in-leach (CIP) circuit. Catalyst has operated
the plant since January 2021. Feed grade during that time has been 3.5-4.0g/t. The 92% recovery
used in the ORE plan is consistent with current plant recoveries and there is no foreseeable reason
to change to projected recovery.
Economic assumptions
• Mine operating costs (including mining, development, maintenance and grade control
drilling) have been based on recent operating history and estimated mining physicals.
Costing for sustaining capital items have been based off recent history, vendor quotes or
management estimates.
• Operating costs for the processing plant have been estimated using recent operating history
and estimated physicals.
• Other operating costs including power and administration have been estimated using recent
operating history.
• Royalties are based on existing royalties with the Tasmanian government and third parties.

ORE RESERVE ESTIMATE
1. Material information summary as required under ASX Listing Rule 5.9.Level of Study
The declaration of Henty Ore Reserve Estimation is based on Catalyst’s internal studies and
Kaiser’s internal review which demonstrate continued economic viability of the currently operating
Henty mine. The level of accuracy of the of the mine plan is technically achievable and operationally
executable.
2. Classification
A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable portion of an Indicated Mineral Resource.
The Ore Reserves classification reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit. Only Probable
reserves have been declared and are based on Indicated Resources following consideration of
modifying factors. No probable Ore Reserves are derived from Measured Resources, as there was
no Measured Resource within the MRE. There is a high level of confidence in the modifying factors
applied because they based on ‘actual’ operating performance currently being achieved at the
Plutonic mine.
3. Mining Method
Henty has been in operation for 28 years, whereby various mining methods have been used in the
past (room and pillar, LHOS with paste fill/ rock fill or no fill) The historic voids have been
incorporated into the MRE and coded to ensure the method of fill determines proximity of stope
shape generation. The mining method used for the Reserve is a combination of Longhole Stoping
and Benching.
Dilution of 15% is applied to the in-situ stope ore tonnes and the ore recovery of 92-95% is applied,
depending on extraction method. Waste development has a 15% dilution factor applied; however
Ore development had no dilution applied. Development has 100% mining recovery applied.
Majority of the stopes will be filled using unconsolidated rock fill trucked from surface or
underground development waste. This will improve stope stability and increase ore recovery while
minimising the backfill costs. Stopes will be filled with waste rock from development where possible
to minimise the trucking requirements.
4. Processing
The Henty Gold Mine has been operational since 1996. The process plant has an annual plant
capacity of 300,000 tonnes and comprises a semi-autogenous mill (SAG) feeding a conventional
carbon-in-leach (CIP) circuit. Catalyst has operated the plant since January 2021. Feed grade
during that time has been 3.5-4.0g/t. The 94% recovery used in the ORE estimation is consistent
with current plant recoveries and there is no foreseeable reason to change to projected recovery.
5. Cut-off Grade
Stope optimiser shapes were initially categorised by using the operating cut-off grade (1.7g/t).
Subsequently, stope shapes that were spatially distant from the mine’s footprint were deleted to
filter inventory requiring excessive development costs to access. Operating cut-off grades applied
to the Ore Reserve Estimate were 1.7g/t for stope shapes (after all forms of dilution and ore loss)
and 1.0g/t for ore development shapes (after applying development profiles to the ore boundary).
Cost and modifying factors used to determine the above COG’s were direct underground operating
(mining and geology) A$ 90/ore t, processing A$ 28/ore t, site G&A A$24/ore t, metallurgical
recovery 92.0%, royalties 5.9% NSR (variable using grade recovery curve) and gold price of
A$3,000/oz.
6. Estimation Methodology
The Ore Reserves estimate is reported within an underground Shape Optimiser (SO) evaluation
from the depleted resource model. SO input parameters include a 1.7 g/t Au cut-off, Gold price of

AUD$3,000/oz, minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 10m. Control strings have
been used to control stope height to a maximum of 15m. The intervals vary from 12-15m, which is
deemed an appropriate method for control of dilution, reduction of pillars and ore loss, ground
control, safety and regional stability. Stable stope dimensions using a maximum HR=4m have
been based on geotechnical assessment.
The orientation of the SO’s is variable depending on the geometry of the minerialisation.
7. Other Material Factors, Approvals and Infrastructure
Activities undertaken onsite are undertaken in accordance with the environmental approvals.
Monitoring programs are conducted to ensure that key approval and licence requirements are
complied with. The Company has demonstrated a strong environmental and social performance,
there are no identified threats that place the company's social licence to operate at risk.
All Henty Mine infrastructure is in place. The Henty TSF is approved for a further two lifts which
will allow production through to 2030.

the global gold Mineral Resources within the Henty Gold Mine deposit, based on sampling data
from Diamond drilling Sludge holes and Channel Samples available as of 28 January 2024.
Mineral Resources are reported below topography and are comprised of fresh rock only.
The Henty Gold Mine March 2024 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) has been undertaken with a
focus on delineating areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic
Extraction (RPEEE) by underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an
underground Shape Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model.
SO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 1.5m minimum stope
length of 5m, stope height of 16m. The orientation of SO’s is variable depending on the geometry
of the mineralisation.
The entire MRE consists of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. No Measured Mineral
Resources have been reported at this stage of the project.

For the most recent drilling completed by Catalyst, DD collar positions are set out by Mine
Surveyors. The drilling crew has an azi-reader device that enables them to set up at the correct
azimuth and dip according to the drillhole plan. Final collar positions are then picked up by Mine
Surveyors at hole completion. For downhole surveys taken up to January 2019, a Devi-flex tool was
used, with surveys taken every few metres. From January 2019 onwards, a downhole Gyroscopic
tool was employed.
For underground workings, development drives are regularly picked up by Mine Surveyors. At stope
completion, a cavity monitoring system is generally used to model the final voids.
The location of face channel samples is determined by measuring the distance from the closest
survey station. The face channel is treated as a short drillhole, with collar and survey information
stored in the site database.
All reported coordinates are referenced to the grid system Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994
(GDA94).
Underground mobile DD drill rigs are utilised to produce either LTK60 or NQ2 size core. Drill core
is not routinely oriented.
4. Historical Drilling
Details relating to geospatial location protocols for drilling earlier than 2009 are unavailable;
however, Catalyst considered it reasonable to assume that industry standard techniques were
employed.
5. Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques
For drillhole data, either whole core or half core is submitted for analysis. In areas where infill
drilling is required, whole core may be submitted given that there are other holes available with half
core for future reference. Sample recovery is recorded for DD core samples as part of geotechnical
logging
Samples are taken at 0.2–1.2 m intervals and honour lithological boundaries, with intervals entered
in the same spreadsheet that is used for logging. Core is cut with an automatic core saw. Samples
are placed in calico bags and then into polyweave bags for transport to the laboratory. Certified
reference materials (CRMs) and blank material are inserted in the sample stream to monitor
analytical bias and carry-over contamination, respectively.
For underground workings, face channel sampling is carried out at grade height (~1.5 m). A
duplicate sample is taken on all faces to monitor sample precision. Samples are taken at 0.2–1.2 m
intervals and honour different rock types, alteration zones, and mineralised zones. CRMs and blank
material are inserted in the sample stream to monitor analytical bias and carry-over contamination,
respectively.
Samples are placed in an oven on site after the geologist returns from underground. The primary
laboratory (ALS in Burnie) collects the samples each morning and generally provides results later
that day, giving a 24–36-hour sample turnaround.
Sludge holes are drilled at Henty in areas where additional grade control data is needed to confirm
grades adjacent to existing development. Sludge holes are drilled with underground production
rigs, with samples collected by operators for each drill rod from drill return fines, and holes flushed
between samples. Sludge hole collar positions are marked out by site surveyors and picked up
once holes are completed, with hole dip and azimuth not measured and taken from design
documents. Sludge samples are processed at the Burnie ALS laboratory using fire assay, with
crushed rock standard and blank material is submitted with each sludge sample batch.
6. Historical Sampling
Details relating to drilling techniques, quality assurance (QA) protocols and quality control (QC)
results for data gathered prior to 2009 is largely unavailable. However, the information provided

indicates that sampling techniques and sample preparation were broadly similar to that of the current
drilling techniques. QA protocols were employed, in some form, for the analytical data gathered
during this period.
7. Sample Analysis Method
Historical information provided indicates that several analytical laboratories have been used over
the history of the Project, and analytical methodologies have varied slightly over time. Typically fire
assay with determination by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) has been used.
Currently all samples are submitted to ALS Burnie for gold analysis. Samples are crushed and
pulverised prior to selection of a 30 g subsample for fire assay with determination by AAS.
Occasionally, bismuth, silver, copper, lead, zinc, arsenic and molybdenum analyses are completed
to assist with understanding the nature of the mineralisation and for metallurgical assessment.
Copper, for example, may consume cyanide during processing. If required, pulps are sent from
Burnie to ALS Townsville for multi- element determination.
In 2020, CSA Global completed a detailed review of the QC data for the period 2016 to 2020 and
the analytical results were considered as being acceptable to support the MRE.
Catalyst submitted a total of 1,856 blank samples between January 2021 and December 2022 and
99% of the blank results were within acceptable limits. Fifteen blank failures (1%) were recorded
during the period. The batches with failed blanks were re-assayed. This is not considered as
presenting a material issue to the MRE.
Catalyst submitted a total of 2,234 standards between January 2021 and December 2022. A total
of eight different types of CRMs were submitted to the laboratory and a new CRM; OREAS 251b
was introduced in December 2022. CSA Global reviewed the results of CRM submissions and
concluded that the submitted CRMs performed within acceptable limits.
Although sample collection, sample preparation, sample logging and analytical techniques have
varied over the Project’s history, all can be considered as industry standard at the time. The amount
of QC data that was collected has also varied over the Project’s history, but overall is considered as
being acceptable to support the MRE.
8. Geology and Geological Interpretation
The Henty deposit lies within the Mount Read Volcanic (MRV) Belt in western Tasmania. The most
important metallogenic event in Tasmania coincided with the deposition of the MRV, which occurred
from the early middle Cambrian to the early late Cambrian. The main mineralised belt of the MRV
between Mount Darwin and Hellyer is the Central Volcanic Complex (CVC). The CVC is dominated by
proximal volcanic rocks (rhyolite and dacite flows, domes and cryptodomes and massive pumice
breccias) and andesite and rare basalt (lavas, hyaloclastites, and intrusive rocks) deposited in a
marine environment.
The Cambrian Tyndall Group Comstock Formation hosts much of the mineralisation at the Henty
deposit. A unit of quartz-bearing volcaniclastic sandstone and conglomerate of mixed felsic and
andesitic provenance, with the latter common towards the base, and minor felsic and andesitic lavas
and intrusive rocks and welded ignimbrite.
The Henty Gold Mine consists of a series of small high-grade lenses of gold mineralisation in
quartz-sericite altered volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks that occupy a large sub-vertical quartz-
sericite alteration zone.
There are three main alteration assemblages intimately associated with the gold mineralisation
as follows:
• MV alteration assemblage:

TABLE:
 | ASX: KAU

ASX: KAU
o Sulphide-poor, quartz+sericite alteration facies (“MV”) is distinguished by pale green
sericite concentrated in cleavage planes that envelop domains of intense silicification. The
boundaries between sulphide-rich domains (“MZ”) and MV domains are typically very
sharp. MV contains minor chalcopyrite and galena, as small coarse-grained
concentrations in siliceous domains, with sparse sphalerite and pyrite. Purple fluorite
occurs in places.
• MQ alteration assemblage:
o High gold grades are most commonly hosted in an intense silicification alteration facies
(“MQ”). The MQ-style alteration is generally 5–50 m stratigraphically below the base of the
Lynchford Tuff and generally shows a close spatial association with MV alteration.
Boundaries between MV and MQ altered rocks are sharp. The MQ has been repeatedly
fractured and annealed, with multiple generations of fine veinlets of quartz, sulphide and
calcite, in contrast to the adjacent sericite-rich MV which behaved in a ductile manner
during deformation. The distinguishing feature of the MQ is that all feldspars and sheet
silicates are replaced by quartz. Late irregular fractures within the MQ contain free gold,
together with pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and minor tellurides and bismuth sulphosalts.
• MZ alteration assemblage:
o Within the footwall of the massive pyrite horizon, the host rocks are altered to a
quartz+sericite+pyrite assemblage with disseminated base metal sulphides (“MZ”). This
assemblage commonly has an apparent fragmental texture and is best developed in
coarse volcaniclastic rocks. Sulphide content is relatively high, averaging ~5%, with
typically 0.1–1 ppm Au. The appearance of base metal sulphides is usually a visual
indicator of anomalous gold grades.
A total of 881,623 m of sampling from 6,756 diamond drill holes, 1,452 sludge holes and 5,822
channel samples were available for the Mineral Resource estimate and supported by a nominal drill
density of 10 x15m along strike.
The Henty deposit comprises 12 individual model areas all of which have been updated in this
MRE (Cradle Zone, Darwin Central, Darwin North, Darwin South, Intermediate Zone, Newton-
Mount Julia, Read Zone, Sill Zone, Tear Away Zone, Tyndall Zone, Zone 15 and Zone 96).
Gold mineralisation domains were interpreted primarily on geological logging, face channel sampling
and geological mapping of underground exposures, based on lithology, grade distribution, major
faults and geometry.
Interpretations of domain continuity were undertaken in Datamine software using all available
drillholes, face channel samples and sludge holes. Interpretation of each ore domain was
constrained by a combination of gold grades (nominally 0.5-1 g/t ) and lithology, with individual lenses
generally conforming to a particular style of alteration.
The domains to the north of the Moa fault steeply dip to the west with a thickness of 1-8 m and run
semi-parallel to the NNE striking Henty Fault; south of the Moa fault the domains trend from NNE to
NE. The mineralisation extends over a strike length (North – South) of approximately 3200 m and
currently extends to a depth of approximately 850 m below surface.
Drillhole data spacing varies somewhat over the deposit area. Density of drilling is selected to match
the complexity of mineralisation, which is recognised as varying between different domains. Most
deposits are drilled out at 10–15 m spacings (along strike and down dip). Drillholes are clustered in
some areas, and often become more widely spaced at the edges of the deposits or in areas where
the mineralisation is low tenor and delineation of economic material is unlikely.
For underground workings face channel sampling is carried out at grade height (~1.5 m) along ore
development drives prior to stoping. Approximately every second cut (or ~6.0 m strike length) is
generally sampled, however, this does not always occur.

CYL considers confidence in mineralisation continuity and distribution, as implied within the Mineral
Resource estimate classification of Indicated and Inferred, is moderate, given the drill spacing
described above and the patchy nature of mineralisation at Henty.
9. Estimation Methodology
The majority of mineralisation domains used in the MRE were manually constructed in Datamine
software. The Z96 geological was constructed using LeapFrog software. Block modelling and grade
interpolation were carried out using Surpac software. Statistical analysis was carried out using
Snowden Supervisor software.
Block model constraints were created by applying the interpreted mineralised domain wireframes.
Sub-celling in all domains was 0.625 m x 0.625 m x 0.625 m to accurately reflect the volumes of the
interpreted wireframes.
All drillhole assay samples were uniquely flagged according to the mineralisation domains. All
drillholes are composited to 1m downhole using a best-fit methodology and 0.5 m minimum threshold
on inclusions. All DD, CH and SL samples were composited to 1m downhole using a best-fit
methodology and 0.5 m minimum threshold on inclusions. A small of residual composites were
retained in the estimation.
Henty gold mineralisation is hosted in multiple sub-parallel and sub-vertical tabular lenses ranging
in strike length from a few tens of meters up to nearly 800m in length. The vertical extent of individual
lenses can range from a few tens of meters to 270m vertically. The true width of the lenses ranges
from 0.5m to >10m. The Henty March 2024 MRE incorporates the estimation of fifty-five individual
mineralised lenses.
The distribution of gold grades within the mineralised lenses is highly variable and is characterised
by distinct cohesive regions of higher tenor gold grades, with clusters of individual values often
reaching several hundred grams per tonne. Whilst these higher-grade zones appear reasonably
cohesive, they are manifested by a high-degree of short-scale variability, making difficult to manually
interpret constraining domains. These internal; high-grade regions are often surrounded by
peripheral regions of lower grade mineralisation that is also highly variable.
Raw Coefficients of Variation (CoV) are typically in the order of 1.5-3.5, indicating moderate to high
grade variability. Some of the more substantial and higher-grade zones such as Z96 have CoV’s of
greater than 5.
The moderate to high grade variability and complex spatial continuity of high grades at Henty
requires a pseudo non-linear approach to deal with these high grades during estimation. A traditional
approach of physical domaining, assay cutting, and linear estimation (IDW or OK) is considered
inadequate in dealing with this complexity.
The estimation method applied to most of the domains combines Categorical Indicator Kriging (CIK)
to define internal estimation sub-domains domains, together with applying distance limiting at chosen
grade thresholds to restrict the influence of the high grade and extreme grade values during grade
interpolation.
Ordinary Kriging (OK) was used to directly estimate a small number of domains that were either
poorly informed with data or where grade variability did not warrant a more sophisticated approach.
Table 2 summarises the estimation method applied to each mine area by estimation domain.

Prior to estimation, a reference surface for each estimation domain was exported from the Leapfrog
This is calculated as the best fit surface using the hangingwall and footwall surfaces. The reference
surface is then imported into Surpac and a dip and dip-direction of each triangle facets is imported
into the Surpac block model to provide information for dynamic search and variogram model
orientation during interpolation. Dynamic estimation is applied for estimating the CIK indicators and
gold grades.
Categorical Indicator Kriging Workflow
Two Categorical Indicator values are determined for the CIK domains:
• A low-grade (LG) indicator of 1.0 g/t Au was assigned to differentiate between background
‘waste’ and low-tenor mineralisation.
• A high-grade (HG) indicator of 5.0 g/t Au was assigned to define broad areas of consistent
higher-tenor mineralisation.
Indicator variograms were modelled for the LG and HG thresholds for all mine areas. The indicator
variograms for both grade thresholds exhibited a moderate nugget effect of between 20-30%. The
LG indicator demonstrated well-structured average continuity of around 35m. The HG indicator
demonstrated less well-structured average continuity of around 19m.
The CIK indicators were estimated using Ordinary Kriging into a finely gridded block model with block
dimensions of 1.25m x 1.25m x 1.25m. The small block size for the indicator process is beneficial for
creating categorical sub-domains at resolution which can be used to accurately back-flag composite
data.
Three categorical sub-domains were generated: low-grade (LG), medium-grade (MG) and high-
grade (HG) areas. The HG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.35 and
the LG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.65. The MG sub-domain is
assigned to blocks that do not satisfy either the HG or LG sub-domain criteria.
The three categorical block model sub-domains (HG, MG and LG) were used to ‘back-flag’ the 1m
composites from each mine area, thus creating a separate composite file for each sub-domain.
Assay top-cuts are applied to the sub-domain composite files on a domain-by-domain basis and are
typically in the following ranges:

MG = 5-50 g/t Au

The assay top-cuts were generally between the 97th to 99.9th percentile of the distribution and were
aimed at globally limiting extreme values only. Top-cuts are not used as the primary tool to control
metal risk. The use of grade thresholds and distance limiting is considered a more objective and
influential method in controlling metal risk, while better reflecting the actual localised occurrence of
discontinuous high-grade gold mineralisation.
Grade variograms were initially attempted separately for the LG, MG and HG sub-domains, however,
this resulted in poorly structured and incoherent variograms. It was decided to use a variogram
modelled on the combined grade data for each mine area. The combined grade variograms typically
exhibited a moderate nugget effect of between 16% and 38% (average 31%) with a maximum range
of continuity of between 21-45m (average 28m).
Grade thresholds for distance limiting were initially determined for each mine area from log-
probability plots and visual inspection. Final distance limits were subsequently optimised following
a detailed backward-looking mill reconciliation using mine stope voids for the period May 2023 to
March 2023 (230Kt). The adjustment of grade distance limits was an iterative process until an
acceptable reconciliation with the mill was achieved. The final applied grade distance limits are
follows:
0-10 g/t = No Limit
10-25 g/t = 20m
25-50 g/t = 15m
>50 g/t = 7.5m
Prior to grade estimation, sub-domain codes from the 1.25m resolution block model are imported into
a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m resolution model and the proportion of LG, MG and HG is calculated for each
2.5m block. Grade estimation for the LG, MG and HG domains was undertaken in Surpac software
using Ordinary Kriging with grade threshold distance limiting. Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (KNA)
was undertaken to assist with defining estimation parameters. Search routines and variogram
orientations are drawn from the pre-populated dynamic search information recorded in each block.
Final block grades at a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m block resolution were calculated by weighting the
estimated grades for each sub-domain by the relevant domain proportion. The parent estimation
block size was 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m. A minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 composites were used for
each sub-domain estimate per block. It is possible that up to 36 composites can be used to estimate
a parent block where there is a proportion of all three sub-domains present. Block discretisation was
set at 3 E x 3 N x 3 RL points (per parent block). A standardised single pass search distance of 40-
60m was used. Octant restrictions were not used. Data spacing varied from <10m x 10m to 40m x
20m.
Model validation was completed to check that the grade estimates within the model were an
appropriate reflection of the underlying composite sample data, and to confirm that the interpolation
parameters were applied as intended. Checks of the estimated block grade with the corresponding
composite dataset were completed using several approaches involving both numerical and spatial
aspects as follows:
• Semi-Local: Using swath plots in X, Y and Z directions comparing the estimates to the sample
data.

Ordinary Kriging Workflow
Ordinary Kriging (OK) was used to directly estimate six domains that were either poorly informed
with data or where grade variability did not warrant a more sophisticated approach.
All DD, CH and SL samples were composited to 1m downhole using a best-fit methodology and 0.5 m
minimum threshold on inclusions. A small number of residual composites were retained in the
estimation.
Composite files were statistically analysed in Supervisor software, with assay top cuts defined. Top
cuts of between 7.5-15 g/t were applied to the data to control the effects of outlier high grade Au
values that were considered not representative. The effect of the top cuts was reviewed with respect
to the resulting Mean and CV values.
Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis was undertaken to assess the effect of changing key kriging
neighbourhood parameters on block grade estimates. Kriging efficiency and slope of regression were
determined for a range of block sizes, minimum/maximum samples, search dimensions and
discretisation grids. Variograms were generated using composited top-cut drill data in Snowden
Supervisor v8 software.
Within each domain, an Ordinary Kriging estimate of gold grade was produced using the cut
composite data. A standardised single pass search distance of 60m was used. Octant restrictions
were not used. Hard boundaries were used for the estimate.
To enable the use of dynamic variograms and search orientations during the estimation of gold, the
reference surfaces for each domain were exported from the Leapfrog project. This is calculated as
the best fit surface using the hanging wall and footwall surfaces.
A minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 (1 m composite) samples per block were used with no limit of
samples per drillhole. The minimums and maximums were established through independent KNA on
each major domain. Block discretisation was set at 3 E x 3 N x 3 RL points (per parent block).
Octant restrictions were not used, and estimates were into parent blocks, not sub-blocks.
Drill spacing was approximately 20m by 20m or closer. Block dimensions were 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m
(XYZ).
Model validation was completed to check that the grade estimates within the model were an
appropriate reflection of the underlying composite sample data, and to confirm that the interpolation
parameters were applied as intended. Checks of the estimated block grade with the corresponding
composite dataset were completed using several approaches involving both numerical and spatial
aspects as follows:
• Semi-Local: Using swath plots in Northing and RL comparing the estimates to the sample
data.
• Local: Visual inspection of the estimated block grades viewed in conjunction with the sample
data.
10. Bulk Density
CSA Global in 2023 were supplied 5,096 “Weight Wet” and “Weight Dry” records determined from
1,662 individual drillholes via the Archimedes (water immersion) method. Density was calculated
from the data by the following equation:
Density= (Weight Air)/ (Weight Air-Weight Water)
The available density data was selected from within the mineralised zone interpretations for the
various model areas. Outlier samples were removed from the data selected and a global average of

density was calculated. A value of 2.8 t/m3 was determined, which has been applied directly to the
model cells for all block model areas. No new density data was available for the 2024 MRE.
11. Classification Criteria
Mineral Resources were classified as Indicated and Inferred to appropriately represent confidence
and risk with respect to data quality, drill hole spacing, geological and grade continuity and
mineralisation volumes. Additional considerations were the stage of project assessment, current
understanding of mineralisation controls and mining selectivity within an underground mining
environment.
The drilling, surveying and sampling undertaken, and analytical methods and quality controls used,
are appropriate for the style of deposit under consideration.
Indicated Mineral Resources were defined where a moderate level of geological confidence in
geometry, continuity and grade was demonstrated, and were identified as areas where:
• The portions of the Henty Gold Mine 2024 MRE classified as Indicated have been flagged in
areas of the model where average drill hole spacing is 20m x 20m or closer. The drill spacing
within the Indicated portion of the resource is appropriate for defining the continuity and
volume of the mineralised domains, at a nominal 20 m drill spacing on 20 m sections.
• Blocks were interpolated with a neighbourhood largely informed by the maximum number of
samples.
Inferred Mineral Resources were defined where a low to moderate level of geological confidence
in geometry, continuity and grade was demonstrated, and were identified as areas where:
• Drill spacing averaged a nominal 40 m or less, or where drilling was within 40 m of the block
estimate.
Further considerations of resource classification include; data type and quality (drilling type, drilling
orientations, down hole surveys, sampling and assaying methods); geological mapping and
understanding; statistical performance including number of samples, slope regression and kriging
efficiency.
Mineralisation within the model which did not satisfy the criteria for classification as Mineral
Resources remained unclassified.
The delineation of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources appropriately reflects the Competent
Person’s view on continuity and risk at the deposit.
12. Cut-off Grade
The Henty underground Mineral Resources is reported at a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au. The cut-off
grade has been derived from current mining and processing costs and metallurgical parameters.
Inputs into the cut-off grade calculation include:
• Mining Fixed and Variable = AUD$66/t
• Grade Control = AUD$12/t ore
• Processing Costs = AUD$28/t ore
• Maintenance Costs = AUD$43/t ore
• Metallurgical Recovery = 92%
• Royalties = 5.9%
• Gold Price = AUD$3,500/oz

In addition to applying a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au, the Mineral Resource has been reported within
an underground Shape Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the undiluted and depleted resource model.
SO input parameters include a minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 5m, stope
height of 16m.
13. Assessment of Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction
The Henty Gold Mine Mineral Resource (MRE) has been undertaken with a focus on delineating
areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) by
underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an underground Shape
Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model that contains 75% or greater of its
volume as in-situ material.
SO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 1.5m minimum stope
length of 5m, stope height of 16m. The orientation of SO’s is variable depending on the geometry of
the mineralisation resource model.
The Mineral Resource is considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction
(RPEEE) given the access to critical infrastructure, the volume and grade of mineralisation available
for mining and the RPEEE criteria which have been applied prior to reporting the Mineral Resource.
14. Mining and Depletion
Underground mining at Henty has taken place since 1996. Mining depletion to January 31, 2024, was
applied to the model.
No dilution or cost factors were applied to the estimate.
15. Metallurgy
Henty is an operating mine and there are no material metallurgical issues that are known to exist.
No metallurgical recovery factors were applied to the Mineral Resources or resource tabulations.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data Henty Gold Mine Deposit
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria Commentary
Sampling • The sampling database for Henty includes data using diamond drilling (DD), channel sampling
techniques and sludge sampling techniques.
• The database was compiled from information collected by numerous previous owners
of the project including:
Catalyst Metals Ltd (CYL) (2021 to current)
Diversified Minerals (DVM) (2016 to 2020)
Unity Mining (2009 to 2016)
Barrick Gold (2006 to 2009)
Placer Dome (2003 to 2006)
Aurion Gold (2001 to 2003)
RGC/Goldfields (1996 to 2001).
• Details relating to drilling techniques, quality assurance (QA) protocols and quality control
(QC) results for data prior to 2009 is unavailable. Drilling completed since 2009 has
reasonable, although partially incomplete descriptions of data collection procedures and
relevant QAQC.
• Diamond drillholes are sampled as either whole core or half core. Samples are taken at
0.2–1 m intervals and honour geological boundaries.
• Face sampling is carried out at mineralisation height (~1.5 m). Samples are taken at
0.2–1 m intervals and honour geological boundaries and mineralised zones as defined
by geologists.
• Sludge holes are drilled with underground production rigs, with samples collected by
operators for each drill rod from drill return fines, and holes flushed between samples.
• Sludge hole collar positions are marked out by site surveyors and picked up once
holes are completed, with hole dip and azimuth not measured and taken from design
documents.
• Sludge samples are processed at the Burnie ALS laboratory using fire assay, with crushed
rock standard and blank material is submitted with each sludge sample batch.
• Diamond drilling and face samples were subsequently pulverised to produce a 30 g charge
for fire assay with determination by atomic absorption spectrometry (FA/AAS) for gold.
Drilling techniques • Underground mobile DD drill rigs are utilised to produce either LTK60 or NQ2 size core. Drill
core is
not routinely oriented.
Drill sample • Drilling recoveries are recorded for diamond core samples as part of geotechnical logging.
recovery • Recovery of drill core is maximised by using drilling techniques and drilling fluids suited
to the particular ground conditions.
• No relationship between grade and recovery has been identified.
Logging • Drillhole logging is carried out at a core shed with adequate facilities including roller-
racks, lighting, core photograph facilities and an automatic core saw.
• Drillholes are logged directly into a MS Excel based spreadsheet on a lap top computer. A
template with project-specific codes has been set up to ensure consistent collection of
relevant geological information.
• Alteration, geotechnical, structure and rock type information are collected into separate
tables using standalone codes. Zones of core loss are also recorded.
• Underground, the backs are mapped 6 m from the face to provide a check for the mapping
from the previous round. If a round is missed, then 9 m requires mapping to provide the 3
m overlap for checking. Faces are photographed for future reference.
• Logging is generally qualitative in nature. All core is stored at site and has been photographed
wet. All DD core has been geologically logged in full (100%).

Estimation and • All geological domains used in the MRE were constructed in Datamine software. Block
modelling techniques modelling and grade interpolation were carried out using Surpac software. Statistical analysis
was carried out using Snowden Supervisor software.
• The majority of mineralisation domains used in the MRE were manually constructed in Datamine
software. The Z96 geological was constructed using LeapFrog software. Block modelling and
grade interpolation were carried out using Surpac software. Statistical analysis was carried out
using Snowden Supervisor software.
• Block model constraints were created by applying the interpreted mineralised
domain wireframes. Sub-celling in all domains was 0.625 m x 0.625 m x 0.625 m to
accurately reflect the volumes of the interpreted wireframes.
• All drillhole assay samples were uniquely flagged according to the mineralisation
domains. All DD, CH and SL samples were composited to 1m downhole using a best-
fit methodology and 0.5 m minimum threshold on inclusions. A small number of
residual composites were retained in the estimation.
• Henty gold mineralisation is hosted in multiple sub-parallel and sub-vertical tabular
lenses ranging in strike length from a few tens of meters up to nearly 800m in
length. The vertical extent of individual lenses can range from a few tens of meters
to 270m vertically. The true width of the lenses ranges from 0.5m to >10m. The
Henty March 2024 MRE incorporates the estimation of fifty-five individual
mineralised lenses.
• The distribution of gold grades within the mineralised lenses is highly variable and is
characterised by distinct cohesive regions of higher tenor gold grades, with clusters
of individual values often reaching several hundred grams per tonne. Whilst these
higher-grade zones appear reasonably cohesive, they are manifested by a high-
degree of short-scale variability, making difficult to manually interpret constraining
domains. These internal; high-grade regions are often surrounded by peripheral
regions of lower grade mineralisation that is also highly variable.
• Raw Coefficients of Variation (CoV) are typically in the order of 1.5-3.5, indicating
moderate to high grade variability. Some of the more substantial and higher-
grade zones such as Z96 have CoV’s of greater than 5.
• The moderate to high grade variability and complex spatial continuity of high grades
at Henty requires a pseudo non-linear approach to deal with these high grades
during estimation. A traditional approach of physical domaining, assay cutting, and
linear estimation (IDW or OK) is considered inadequate in dealing with this
complexity.
• The estimation method applied to most of the domains (49) combines Categorical
Indicator Kriging (CIK) to define internal estimation sub-domains domains, together
with applying distance limiting at chosen grade thresholds to restrict the influence
of the high grade and extreme grade values during grade interpolation.
• Ordinary Kriging (OK) was used to directly estimate a small number (6) of domains
that were either poorly informed with data or where grade variability did not
warrant a more sophisticated approach.
• Prior to estimation, a reference surface for each estimation domain was exported
from the Leapfrog . This is calculated as the best fit surface using the hanging wall
and footwall surfaces. The reference surface is then imported into Surpac and a dip
and dip-direction of each triangle facets is imported into the Surpac block model to
provide information for dynamic search and variogram model orientation during
interpolation. Dynamic estimation is applied for estimating the CIK indicators and
gold grades.
Categorical Indicator Kriging Workflow
• Two Categorical Indicator values are determined for the CIK domains:
o A low-grade (LG) indicator of 1.0 g/t Au was assigned to differentiate
between background ‘waste’ and low-tenor mineralisation.
o A high-grade (HG) indicator of 5.0 g/t Au was assigned to define broad areas
of consistent higher-tenor mineralisation.
• Indicator variograms were modelled for the LG and HG thresholds for all mine areas.
The indicator variograms for both grade thresholds exhibited a moderate nugget
effect of between 20-30%. The LG indicator demonstrated well-structured average

continuity of around 35m. The HG indicator demonstrated less well-structured
average continuity of around 19m.
• The CIK indicators were estimated using Ordinary Kriging into a finely gridded block
model with block dimensions of 1.25m x 1.25m x 1.25m. The small block size for
the indicator process is beneficial for creating categorical sub-domains at resolution
which can be used to accurately back-flag composite data.
• Three categorical sub-domains were generated: low-grade (LG), medium-grade
(MG) and high-grade (HG) areas. The HG sub-domain was based on an indicator
probability threshold of 0.35 and the LG sub-domain was based on an indicator
probability threshold of 0.65. The MG sub-domain is assigned to blocks that do not
satisfy either the HG or LG sub-domain criteria.
• The three categorical block model sub-domains (HG, MG and LG) were used to
‘back-flag’ the 1m composites from each mine area, thus creating a separate
composite file for each sub-domain.
• Assay top-cuts are applied to the sub-domain composite files on a domain-by-
domain basis and typically in the following ranges:
o HG = 15-300 g/t Au
o MG = 5-50 g/t Au
o LG = 2.5-5 g/t Au
• The assay top-cuts were generally between the 97th to 99.9th percentile of the
distribution and were aimed at globally limiting extreme values only. Top-cuts are not
used as the primary tool to control metal risk. The use of grade thresholds and
distance limiting is considered a more objective and influential method in controlling
metal risk, while better reflecting the actual localised occurrence of discontinuous
high-grade gold mineralisation.
• Grade variograms were initially attempted separately for the LG, MG and HG sub-
domains, however, this resulted in poorly structured and incoherent variograms. It was
decided to use a variogram modelled on the combined grade data for each mine area.
The combined grade variograms typically exhibited a moderate nugget effect of
between 16% and 38% (average 31%) with a maximum range of continuity of between
21-45m (average 28m).
• Grade thresholds for distance limiting were initially determined for each mine area
from log- probability plots and visual inspection. Final distance limits were
subsequently optimised following a detailed backward-looking mill reconciliation
using mine stope voids for the period May 2023 to March 2023 (230Kt). The
adjustment of grade distance limits was an iterative process until an acceptable
reconciliation with the mill was achieved. The final applied grade distance limits are
follows:
o 0-10 Au g/t= No Limit
o 10-25 Au g/t = 20m
o 25-50 Au g/t = 15m
o >50 Au g/t = 7.5m
• Prior to grade estimation, sub-domain codes from the 1.25m resolution block model are
imported into a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m resolution model and the proportion of LG, MG
and HG is calculated for each
2.5m block. Grade estimation for the LG, MG and HG domains was undertaken in
Surpac software using Ordinary Kriging with grade threshold distance limiting. Kriging
Neighbourhood Analysis (KNA) was undertaken to assist with defining estimation
parameters. Search routines and variogram orientations are drawn from the pre-
populated dynamic search information recorded in each block.
• Final block grades at a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m block resolution were calculated by
weighting the estimated grades for each sub-domain by the relevant domain
proportion. The parent estimation block size was 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m. A minimum of 2
and maximum of 12 composites were used for each sub-domain estimate per block. It
is possible that up to 36 composites can be used to estimate a parent block where
there is a proportion of all three sib-domains present. Block discretisation was set at 3
E x 3 N x 3 RL points (per parent block). A standardised single pass search distance of
40-60m was used. Octant restrictions were not used. Data spacing varied from <10m x
10m to 40m x 20m.

defined. Top cuts of between 7.5-15 g/t were applied to the data to control the
effects of outlier high grade Au values that were considered not representative. The
effect of the top cuts was reviewed with respect to the resulting Mean and CV values
• Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis was undertaken to assess the effect of changing key kriging
neighbourhood parameters on block grade estimates. Kriging efficiency and slope of regression
were determined for a range of block sizes, minimum/maximum samples, search dimensions and
discretisation grids. Variograms were generated using composited top-cut drill data in Snowden
Supervisor v8 software.

Metallurgical factors or
assumptions | • Henty is an operating mine and there are no material metallurgical issues that are known to exist.
Environmental factors or
assumptions | • Henty is an operating mine with environmental permits in place.
Bulk density | • Bulk density determinations adopted the water displacement method.
• Samples were not wax coated prior to immersion. The host lithologies are not porous.
• Density has been applied on a global basis as follows:
2.76 g/cm3 for all model areas.
Classification | • Factors considered when classifying the model include:
• The portions of the Henty March 2024 MRE classified as Indicated have been flagged in
areas of the model where average data spacing is 20m x 20m or closer. The data spacing
within the Indicated portion of the resource is appropriate for defining the continuity
and volume of the mineralised domains.
• The portions of the Henty March 2024 MRE classified as Inferred represent minor areas
where geological continuity is present but not consistently confirmed by 20 m x 20 m
drilling.
• Further considerations of resource classification include; data type and quality (drilling
type, drilling orientations, down hole surveys, sampling and assaying methods);
geological mapping and understanding; statistical performance including number of
samples, kriging quality parameters, mill reconciliation and visual validation.
• The Mineral Resource estimate appropriately reflects the view of the Competent Person.
Audits or reviews | • The geological interpretation, estimation parameters and validation of the resource model
was peer reviewed by Catalyst staff.
• No external reviews of the resource estimate had been carried out at the time of writing.
Discussion of relative

operation since 1996.
• The Ore Reserves were estimated using Deswik software and reported against the updated

o Cost and modifying factors used to determine the above COG’s were:
o Direct underground operating (mining and geology) A$ 90/ore t
o Processing A$ 28/ore t
o Site G&A A$24/ore t
o Metallurgical Recovery 92.0%
o Royalties WA State 5.9% NSR (variable using grade recovery curve)
o A gold price of A$3,000/oz was used in the assessment.
Mining factors or • The Ore Reserves estimate is reported within an underground Shape Optimiser (SO) evaluation
assumptions from the depleted resource model. SO input parameters include a 1.7 g/t Au cut-off, Gold price
of AUD$3,000/oz, minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 10m. Control strings
have been used to control stope height to a maximum of 15m. The intervals vary from 12-15m,
which is deemed an appropriate method for control of dilution, reduction of pillars and ore loss,

Henty has been in operation for 28 years, whereby various mining methods have been used in
the past (room and pillar, LHOS with paste fill/ rock fill or no fill) The historic voids have been

Geology | • The Henty deposit lies within the Mount Read Volcanic Belt in western Tasmania. The belt
hosts several world-class polymetallic orebodies including the Hellyer, Que River, Rosebery,
Hercules and Mount Lyell deposits. The whole belt has been overprinted with a regional
lower green schist facies metamorphism.
• Mineralisation consists of a series of small high-grade lenses of gold mineralisation
hosted in quartz-sericite altered volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks that occupy a large
sub-vertical quartz-sericite alteration shear zone. Gold is present as both free gold
and as gold-rich electrum associated with chalcopyrite and galena in the main
mineralised zone.
