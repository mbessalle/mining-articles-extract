2 DECEMBER 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
DIVESTMENT OF CANGAI COPPER MINE 
 
HIGHLIGHTS:  
o 
CCZ’s Board is delighted to confirm that Infinity Mining’s (ASX: IMI) shareholders approved the 
Cangai Copper Mine Project acquisition at a General Meeting1 held on Thursday, 28 November 
2024 and a binding Tenement Sale Agreement has now been executed between the parties 
o 
Under the terms of the divestment, IMI will issue CCZ 40m shares and 20m options (5-years @ 
$0.07 exercise price) as consideration for the acquisition1 
o 
Consequently, with CCZ becoming a significant shareholder, it should benefit from any value 
created as IMI’s plans to undertake a comprehensive exploration campaign across the Cangai 
Copper Mine Project unfold  
o 
The successful divestment of the Cangai Copper Mine Project (for equity consideration) is 
CCZ’s second non-core asset sale in the last 12-months: 
• 
Pleasingly, value created from exiting the position in ASX-listed Rimfire Pacific Mining 
NL (ASX: RIM) – received from selling the Broken Hill West Project – will be redeployed 
to advance the Harts Range Niobium-Uranium Project in the Northern Territory2  
o 
For the remaining coppers assets, the Board’s plans are two-fold:  
• 
Secure a strategic partner to progress the NWQ Copper Project, commencing with the 
Big One Deposit; and 
• 
Hold the remaining two non-core assets – Broken Hill East Project in NSW and Mkushi 
Copper Project in Zambia – until they are sold   
 
CASTILLO COPPER’S CHAIRMAN, GED HALL COMMENTED: 
“This is excellent news as it coincides with CCZ shortly changing its name to New Frontier 
Minerals and rechannelling efforts into developing the Harts Range Uranium, Niobium and Rare 
Earth Elements Project in the Northern Territory. The Board’s strategy to hold non-core assets 
until the right development partner materialises has the potential to unlock significant value that 
can be redeployed to advance the core Harts Range Project. The Board has an exciting 
exploration agenda for 2025 and looks forward to progressing this at an accelerated pace.”   
 
The Board of Castillo Copper Limited authorised the release of this announcement 
to the ASX.
