# Ridgeline Minerals Receives Approval for Exploration Earn-In Agreement with South32 at the Selena Project, Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 6, 2024) - Ridgeline Minerals Corp. (TSXV: RDG) (OTCQB: RDGMF) FRA: 0GC0) ("**Ridgeline** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce, further to its news release on August 22, 2024, that the TSX Venture Exchange has accepted for filing the previously announced Earn-In Agreement dated August 21, 2024 (the "**Earn-In Agreement** " or "**Agreement** ") with a wholly-owned subsidiary of South32 Limited ("**South32** ") at the Selena carbonate replacement deposit project ("**Selena** " or the "**Project** ") located in White Pine County, Nevada. 

The Earn-In Agreement was signed effective August 21, 2024, wherein South32 has the option to earn an initial 60% ownership interest in the Project by paying Ridgeline a US$100,000 execution payment and funding a minimum of US$10.0 million (of which US$2.0 million is guaranteed) in qualifying exploration expenditures on the Project over an initial five-year term. Ridgeline will remain operator of the Project during the Initial Phase 1 Earn-in Option period (the "**First Option** "). Subject to South32 having exercised the First Option, South32 will have a further option (the "**Second Option** ") to increase its ownership interest in the Project to a total of 80% by incurring an additional US$10.0 million in expenditures over a three-year Phase 2 Earn-In Option period for an aggregate spend of US$20.0 million over eight years. 

If South32 wishes to exercise the Second Option, it must within 42 months of the Second Option commencement date, arrange for and provide draft definitive documentation in respect of a debt facility ("**Ridgeline Facility** ") from which (if executed) Ridgeline may draw on to sufficiently fund Ridgeline's share of costs associated with the development of a mine at Selena through to commercial production. Execution of the Ridgeline Facility will be subject to, among other things, approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.
