DIVESTMENT OF NON-CORE
WHITEHEADS GOLD PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
➢ Great Western Gold Pty Ltd (GWG) to acquire 100% of Great Boulders’ interest in the
Whiteheads Gold Project (Whiteheads) located in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia
➢ Great Boulder to receive the following consideration for the sale of Whiteheads:
o Exclusivity Fee: $50,000 cash payment (Paid)
o Cash Payment: a one-off cash payment at Listing, less the Exclusivity Fee, as a
reimbursement for reasonable cash payments incurred by Great Boulder with
respect to exploration and expenditure commitment at Whiteheads during the period
commencing on the Execution Date (today) and Completion Date (estimated costs of
~$250,000 to be incurred)
o Equity: Upfront and deferred equity consideration in GWG totalling $1,200,000
(assuming a $0.20 per share Listing price)
➢ GWG intends to complete an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX) in 1H-CY25
➢ The divestment of the non-core Whiteheads Gold Project allows Great Boulder to
continue to prioritise management time and capital allocation on progressing its flagship
Side Well Gold Project, whilst retaining equity upside to Whiteheads
Great Boulder Resources (“Great Boulder” or the “Company”) (ASX: GBR) is pleased to provide
an update regarding its Whiteheads Gold Project located 40km north of Kalgoorlie, Western
Australia.
Great Boulder’s Managing Director, Andrew Paterson commented:
“This is a great outcome for Great Boulder shareholders. The prospectivity and potential of
Whiteheads has been overlooked given the significant exploration success at Side Well, resulting in
the prioritisation of funds and management time, and we’re pleased to be working with Great
Western Gold to unlock value here.
In addition to maximising the value for Great Boulder shareholders from Whiteheads, this transaction
will further sharpen our focus on Side Well, where we are progressing a fully funded +50,000m drill
program to deliver material resource growth and new discoveries.

As we exit the project I’d like to thank our Joint Venture partner Scott Wilson for his support.
Whiteheads was an important stepping stone for Great Boulder back in 2019 and Scott has been a
great supporter of the Company ever since.”
