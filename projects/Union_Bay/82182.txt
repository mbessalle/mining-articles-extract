# Granite Creek Copper Incorporates Geologic Hydrogen Subsidiary, Options Union Bay Project and Appoints Allegra Hosford Scheirer to Lead Advisory Board

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 /****Granite Creek Copper Ltd. (TSXV:GCX)(OTCQB:GCXXF) ("Granite Creek" or the "Company")** is pleased to announce that it has incorporated Element One Hydrogen Ltd as a wholly owned subsidiary to further advance the exploration for geologic hydrogen. The Company is currently completing research in several jurisdictions in North America for possible acquisitions of projects prospective for both stimulated hydrogen from ultramafic rocks and for discovery of accumulations of hydrogen in the subsurface from various sources.

The Company further announces that it has entered into an agreement dated December 16, 2024 (the Option Agreement") granting 1508260 B.C. Ltd the option to acquire an 100% interest in the recently staked Union Bay hydrogen project ("Union Bay" or the "Project") located in Southeast Alaska. Union Bay is a classic "Ural-Alaska type" underlain by a zoned ultramafic-mafic complex, which ranges from dunite through wehrlite and magnetite-bearing olivine clinopyroxenite to hornblendite and gabbro on the margins. Exploration work completed on the project by previous owners included geological mapping and sampling, geophysical surveys and drilling which identified several high-grade platinum target areas. Research has shown that the olivine component in various ultramafic lithologies such as dunite and wehrlite may be conducive to production of hydrogen by interaction of water at depth.
