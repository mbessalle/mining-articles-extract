50km of the project.
Neighbouring operating mines include:
Northern Star3 (ASX:NST)
• Thunderbox Mine3 (4.2M oz Au Resources) 20km to the west
• Wonder Underground (0.9Moz Au Resources3) <1km west
Genesis Minerals4 (ASX:GMD)
• Hub Project (0.7 Moz Au Resources) adjoining Music Well Project
Vault Minerals5 (ASX:VAU)
• Darlot Gold Mine (1.9 Moz Au Resources) is located 12km north
• King of the Hills mine (4.1 Moz Au Resources) 20km to the south west
• Extensive geophysics, gravity, soil sampling and rock chipping have already been
completed with data validation and target prioritization underway
• Potential for gold discoveries from the dedicated and focused Augustus exploration
team over the next 2 years.
Andrew Ford, GM Exploration commented
“The acquisition of such a large prospective gold exploration package in close proximity to
operating mines owned by Northern Star, Genesis and Vault Minerals with +12M oz of
resources and over 450kozpa gold production2 is a significant coup for Augustus (Figure 1).
“With the gold price now exceeding A$4,000/oz it provides Augustus Shareholders with
significant exposure to future discovery in one of the greatest gold provinces in the world”.

ASX Announcement | 5 November 2024
Background
Augustus Minerals Limited (ASX: AUG) has executed a binding share purchase agreement
(“SPA”) with MCA Nominees Pty Ltd (“MCA”) to acquire 100% of the issued capital in Music
Well Gold Mines Pty Ltd (“MWGM”), an entity which holds the exploration licences comprising
the Music Well Gold Project (“Project”). The Project is in the Eastern Goldfields region of
Western Australia located 35km north of Leonora.
Comprising ten granted exploration licences covering an area of approximately 1,052km2 and
two exploration licences in application covering an area of 293km2. The total tenement
package is 1,345 sq km making the Project one of the largest exploration packages in the
region.
Augustus believes that adding a gold focussed exploration project of this size provides
optionality and complements its copper/base-metals/uranium focus at the Ti Tree Shear
project in the Gascoyne.
Music Well Project
The Project is located within the Murrin Murrin domain, Kurnalpi Terrane of the Yilgarn Craton
in the Leonora / Laverton Greenstone Belt of Western Australia.
The Yilgarn is a globally significant mineralised province for gold, nickel and aluminium, and
also hosts major deposits of other minerals such as copper, zinc and iron along with other
resources such as tantalum, lithium, vanadium, uranium and rare earth elements (“REEs”).

for source data for Mineral Resources of Gold Deposits in the Leonora-Laverton District).
MWGM initiated the consolidation of tenements and commenced field work, on ground
exploration and targeting studies from November 2019. In the resulting 5-year period from
November 2019 to November 2024 the Company has consolidated a tenement package of
Augustus Acquires 1,345km2 Gold Exploration Project Near Leonora 2

ASX Announcement | 5 November 2024
1,345 sq kms and has identified priority targets for follow up exploration work for Air Core,
RC and Diamond Drilling.
These high priority targets have been identified by using MWGMs “Three – Schema Gold
Prospectivity Model” which incorporates and utilises classical structural mapping
techniques, geochemistry such as Ultra Fine + (UFF) soil sampling, rock chip sampling and
advanced geophysics. This multi-disciplinary approach to exploration utilising high-resolution
airborne magnetics, gravity and radiometric data, including (UFF) soil sampling over + 1,052sq
kms also includes the reinterpretation of the solid geology, structure and deformation history
of the region to inform local interpretation of the geological framework and identification of
the targets completed over a 5-year period within the Project area.
The geological studies, completed with the assistance of a group of technical specialists,
including Southern Geoscience, Fathom Geophysics, Tower Geoscience, Geobase
Australia, Daishat Geodictic Gravity Surveyors, Walter Witt Experience and GeoSpy
Australia utilising high-resolution airborne magnetics, gravity and radiometric data.
The principal target types include gold in shear zones within granitoids and greenstones
(analogous to the nearby Wonder Deeps Gold Mine (Northern Star) and intrusion-related
gold systems potentially analogous to King of the Hills and Darlot Centenary mines located
southwest and north of the Music Well Gold Project respectively. The Music Well Gold Project
is considered to be prospective for gold, base metals and also for lithium, tantalum and REE,
which will also be investigated.
The tenement area is characterised by a strongly deformed stratigraphy and intrusions and
contains numerous predominantly west-northwest anastomosing subparallel shear zones
providing links potentially to Wonder Deeps and Thunderbox gold mines (Northern Star)
located to the west of the project area; and the Hub (Redcliffe) gold deposit located to the
east (Genesis).
In addition, a series of north-northwest and north-northeast structures trend through the
project area and structures of a similar orientation host many of the gold deposits in the
Leonora / Laverton area.
There are numerous operating gold mines in the district including the Darlot Gold Mine (~12
km to the north), the King of the Hills Mine (~20 km to the west), the Leonora Gold Camp
(~30km to the southwest), and the Thunderbox Gold Mine (~20 km to the west) (Figure 2).

In addition to the potential gold prospectivity of the Project, the Teutonic Bore, Jaguar and
Bentley Neoarchaean volcanic hosted massive sulphide Cu-Zn deposits are located some
60km north of Leonora and within 20km of the Music Well Project area. Mining at Teutonic
Bore over a period of 5 years extracted 5.355Mt at 2.6% Cu, 9.7% Zn, 126g/t Ag and 0.20g/t
Au6 from high grade massive sulphides.
The Teutonic Bore VMS deposits highlight the exploration potential for the discovery of high-
grade VMS gold and copper deposits within the Music Well Project tenement area.
There are 8 operating gold treatment plants within a 150Km radius of the Music Well Project
in the Leonora / Laverton district providing milling options for any major discovery.
