# Foremost Lithium Completes Acquisition of The Little Granite Mine in the Winston Group of Properties, New Mexico, USA, Announces Chairman, Executive and Adviser Appointments

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 14, 2022) - **Foremost Lithium Resource & Technology Ltd.** **(CSE: FAT) (OTCQB: FRRSF) (FSE: F0R0) (WKN: A3DCC8) (**[**www.foremostlithium.com**](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/8AYxZhJ1kJ)**) (** "**Foremost Lithium** "**,** "**Foremost** "**** or the "**Company** "**)** is pleased to announce further to its news release of March 31, 2015, that it has entered into an amended property acquisition agreement pursuant to which it has acquired 100% interest of the Little Granite Claims in the Winston Group of Properties Gold/Silver Project (the "**Property** "). 

Under the amended terms, Foremost successfully negotiated the final cash payment required to exercise its option on the Property from $380,000USD to $75,000USD which has been satisfied through the issuance a non-interest-bearing promissory note to the arm's length Vendor (the "**Note** "). The Note is due and payable by October 15, 2023, of which an initial $25,000 payment has been made. Following these amendments, the Company has acquired the Property for aggregate consideration of $186,000USD, versus aggregate consideration of $434,000USD under the original terms.

The Winston Gold and Silver Project is home to three historic producing mines: Ivanhoe, Emporia, and Little Granite located in Sierra County, New Mexico, USA. The project covers a 2780-acre property consisting of 139 unpatented BLM (Bureau of Land Management) mining claims and 2 patented Ivanhoe and Emporia lode mining claims. The Little Granite Mine has been worked during several periods since discovery in the 1870s; workings consist of 3 shafts, a 470ft decline, and several underground levels. The historic mines are hosted by north-south orientated vein systems which display characteristics typical of low sulphidation epithermal style mineralization, carrying grades in gold and silver. A sampling program at the Little Granite Mine last year, returned results ranging from 0.10 to 66.50 g/t gold and 7.6 to 2,940 g/t silver as disclosed in the Company's press release on June 29, 2022.

Jason Barnard, Foremost's President and CEO states, _"The Winston Gold/Silver Project is an exceptional property with strong potential, returning assays as high 66 g/t gold and 4,610 g/t silver. Significantly reducing our capex, allows us to redirect the budget to a 2023 drill program in New Mexico, which our Company and shareholders have anticipated for many years. I look forward to strategizing these objectives with our new board and management team."_
