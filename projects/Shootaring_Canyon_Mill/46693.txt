# Anfield Prepares For An Increase in Mill Production Capacity With the Acquisition of Additional DOE leases in Colorado

VANCOUVER, British Columbia , Jan. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Anfield Energy Inc. (TSX.V: AEC; OTCQB: ANLDF; FRANKFURT: 0AD) (“Anfield” or “the Company”)**  is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, Highbury Resources, Inc. (“Highbury”) has entered into a definitive agreement with Gold Eagle Mining Inc. (“GEM”) and Golden Eagle Uranium LLC (“GEU”) (collectively, “the Sellers”) to acquire a 100% interest in twelve Department of Energy (DOE) leases (“DOE Leases”) and associated data in various Counties in Colorado. The acquisition meets Anfield’s strategic objective of securing additional uranium and vanadium prospects as the Company prepares for an increase in production capacity throughput at Shootaring to 1,000 tons per day from 750 tons per day as part of its mill restart plan. Crucially, it provides Anfield with control over 21 of the 31 DOE leases in existence in Colorado, further strengthening the Company’s long-term strategic production position in the State.  


Corey Dias, Anfield’s CEO commented: “We are quite pleased to acquire these twelve additional DOE Leases which we believe are complementary to both our Slick Rock project and the nine DOE leases we currently hold in Colorado and underscores our commitment to uranium and vanadium production coming from this state. The strategic value of these Leases cannot be overstated, as many of them are contiguous to Anfield’s current Colorado holdings and could, therefore, be combined to create improved production economies of scale. Moreover, given that the stated uranium resource associated with each Lease has been determined by the DOE and its predecessor agencies, and when married to the historical production at each Lease site, we are confident that these uranium pounds will serve as an established base from which these resources could grow. Finally, the securing of these Leases provides the Company with the flexibility to categorize all of our DOE Leases within our DOE Lease portfolio in order to identify those we would consider the most prospective and prioritize their advancement to production.

“We will continue to seek out prospective uranium and vanadium assets which align with our two-fold production strategy. The near-term strategy centers on our advanced Utah and Colorado uranium and vanadium projects – Velvet Wood, West Slope, Slick Rock and our newly-acquired DOE leases – underpinned by our wholly-owned Shootaring Canyon mill, one of only 3 licensed, permitted and constructed conventional mills in the U.S. The long-term production strategy remains focused on the acquisition of complementary assets with the potential to feed additional uranium and vanadium resources to our Shootaring Canyon mill. The uranium and vanadium pounds associated with these DOE leases may serve as near-term feed under either the mill’s current throughput capacity of 750 tons per day or the proposed expanded throughput capacity of 1,000 tons per day. Finally, the Company will continue to pursue an expanded annual licensed uranium production capacity of up to 3 million pounds.”

There has been historical uranium and vanadium production on 10 of the 12 acquired DOE Leases, as shown below:

According to the DOE Uranium Lease Program, there remains significant uranium pounds associated with many of the acquired leases, as shown below. Please note that the “bid amount”, that is, the stated uranium pounds as determined by DOE and its predecessor agencies such as the Atomic Energy Corporation, is a function of the historical permitted ore from a DOE Lease minus the historical production from that Lease. The Company is providing this information to assist readers in assessing the scope of the DOE Leases. Readers are cautioned that these amounts are not necessarily indicative of mineral resources which may exist on the DOE Leases, nor is the Company treating them as current mineral resources.

**About Anfield**

Anfield is a uranium and vanadium development and near-term production company that is committed to becoming a top-tier energy-related fuels supplier by creating value through sustainable, efficient growth in its assets.    Anfield is a publicly traded corporation listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (AEC-V), the OTCQB Marketplace (ANLDF) and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (0AD). Anfield is focused on its conventional asset centre, as summarized below:

_Arizona/Utah/Colorado – Shootaring Canyon Mill_

A key asset in Anfield’s portfolio is the Shootaring Canyon Mill in Garfield County, Utah. The Shootaring Canyon Mill is strategically located within one of the historically most prolific uranium production areas in the United States, and is one of only three licensed uranium mills in the United States.

Anfield’s conventional uranium assets consist of mining claims and state leases in southeastern Utah, Colorado, and Arizona, targeting areas where past uranium mining or prospecting occurred. Anfield’s conventional uranium assets include the Velvet-Wood Project, the Frank M Uranium Project, the West Slope Project, as well as the Findlay Tank breccia pipe. A NI 43-101 PEA has been completed for the Velvet-Wood Project. The PEA is preliminary in nature, and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and, resultantly, there is no certainty that the included preliminary economic assessment would be realized. All conventional uranium assets are situated within a 200-mile radius of the Shootaring Mill.
