# Arizona Sonoran Purchases Contiguous MainSpring Property Providing Additional Planning Flexibility for the PFS

CASA GRANDE, Ariz. & TORONTO--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--**Arizona Sonoran Copper Company Inc.** (TSX:ASCU | OTCQX:ASCUF) (“ASCU” or the “Company”), an emerging US-based copper developer and near-term producer, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement (“PSA”) in respect of the MainSpring property, 523 acres of private land immediately south of the Parks/Salyer project and east of the mine access road (the “MainSpring Property”). The total increased land position of the combined Cactus and Parks/Salyer project is expected to be 5,368 acres, up from 4,845 acres. As a result, operational flexibility significantly improves with regards to planning requirements for the re-scoped pre-feasibility study (“PFS”) (see [**FIGURE 1**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Farizonasonoran.com%2Fprojects%2Fcactus-mine-project%2Fpress-release-images%2F&esheet=53353714&newsitemid=20230228006338&lan=en-US&anchor=FIGURE+1&index=1&md5=ef7184a6302c73746d574ad6479801fe)). 

**George Ogilvie, Arizona Sonoran President and CEO stated** , “As we continue to progress towards the design, engineering and infrastructure layout phases of the study, the MainSpring Property provides the Company with strategic alternatives to plan and optimize the re-scoped PFS. Specifically, the additional land allows for optimization within production scenarios being reviewed at Parks/Salyer and further flexibility in a potential Nuton scenario, thus allowing consideration of the most value accretive proposition for shareholders.” 

**Key Terms of the PSA**

Cactus 110 LLC (a group company of ASCU) has entered into a purchase and sale agreement in respect of certain parcels of real property situated in Pinal County comprising of approximately 523 acres. The total purchase price for the property is US$14 million to be paid as below: 

  * Payment of a US$1 million non-refundable deposit into an escrow account at the time of signing of the agreement; 
  * Payment of US$2 million on or prior to the expiry of the PSA Due Diligence date (such date being 5 months (subject to one month’s extension at the option of ASCU) into escrow; 
  * Payment of US$5 million one year from the effective date (being the signing date of the PSA) (“Closing Date”). Title is then transferred to Cactus 110 LLC; 
  * Payment of US$6 million together with accrued interest at 6% per annum, within 1 year from the Closing Date secured by way of a promissory note and deed of trust on the subject property. The promissory note may be repaid at any time prior to maturity with no penalties following which the deed of trust will be released. 



The agreements also include customary terms and conditions as applicable to transactions of a similar nature. 

The MainSpring Property demonstrates exploration upside contiguous to the Parks/Salyer project and may be the subject of future work programs for the Company. However, in the medium term, the Company’s focus remains on mine planning and engineering required for the upcoming PFS incorporating the existing Parks/Salyer and Cactus resource base. 

Permitting activities will be directed to the State and County levels in a similar process to owning private land.

ASCU’s objective is to become a mid-tier copper producer with low operating costs and to develop the Cactus and Parks/Salyer Projects that could generate robust returns for investors and provide a long term sustainable and responsible operation for the community and all stakeholders.

Contiguous to the Cactus Project is the Company’s 100%-owned Parks/Salyer deposit that could allow for a phased expansion of the Cactus Mine once it becomes a producing asset. The Company is led by an executive management team and Board which have a long-standing track record of successful project delivery in North America complemented by global capital markets expertise.
