Divestment of Mt Venn Project
Highlights
Orbminco Limited (ASX:OB1) signs non-binding heads of agreement with
Sarama Resources Ltd (ASX:SRR) to divest 80% interest in Mt Venn Project.
Subject to completion, the consideration for the sale is as follows:
• A non-refundable exclusivity payment of $20,000 (which has been
received); and
• The issue of 12,000,000 Chess Depository Instruments (“CDIs”) in Sarama
to Orbminco (~3% of Sarama’s issued capital) upon completion.
Orbminco Limited, formerly Woomera Mining Limited, (ASX:OB1)(“Orbminco” or
“Company”) is pleased to announce that it has signed a non-binding heads of
agreement with Sarama Resources Ltd (ASX:SRR), to divest its 80% interest in the Mt
Venn Project.
The divestment of Mt Venn aligns with Orbminco’s new focus on its Bronze Fox
Project in the Mongolian South Gobi Copper Belt.
Orbminco’s Chair Ian Gordon commented: “The divestment of Mt Venn, when
completed, will be a win – win for both businesses, with Sarama able to
complement their Cosmos Project with another quality asset in the region and
Orbminco retaining continued leverage to Mt Venn, via its shareholding in Sarama.”
Transaction Summary
As part of the terms of the divestment, Orbminco has granted Sarama a right of
exclusivity on and from the date of execution of the HoA and ending after a period
of 4-months or the date of execution of a binding agreement in respect of the
Transaction, whichever is earlier. In return for the grant of exclusivity, Sarama has
agreed to make a non-refundable cash payment of A$20,000 to Orbminco.
During this time, Sarama has also agreed to make payments on behalf of
Orbminco for annual exploration licence government rental fees totalling
approximately A$39,900 to ensure continuity of tenure for two of the exploration
licences the subject of the Transaction.
