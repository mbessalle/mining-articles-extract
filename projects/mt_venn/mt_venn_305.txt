Mt Venn Project
Mt Venn Project
The Project is comprised of 3 contiguous exploration tenements covering approximately 420km²
in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, approximately 110km north-east of Laverton and
35km west of the regionally- significant Gruyere Gold Mine(3). The Project is readily accessible via
the Great Central Road which services the regional area east of Laverton.
The Project captures the majority of the underexplored Jutson Rocks Greenstone Belt over a strike
length of ~50km. Rocks within the belt feature a diverse sequence of volcanic lithologies of varying
composition, together with pyroclastics and metasediments. Several internal intrusive units have
been identified throughout the Project and are commonly associated with local structural features. A
regionally extensive shear zone, spanning 1-3km in width, extends the entire length of the belt

Gold mineralisation was first discovered in the 1920's with sampling returning very high grades and
prompting the commencement of small-scale mining operations in the mid 1920's. Multiple gold
occurrences have since been identified throughout the Project, demonstrating the prospectivity of the
system. Despite the identification of several km-scale gold-in-soil anomalies by soil geochemistry
and auger drilling, many of these targets are yet to be properly tested. Encouragingly, drilling by
Cazaly Resources Limited ("Cazaly") (ASX: CAZ) at the Project intersected broad, gold
mineralisation over several fences in weathered and fresh rock at the Three Bears Prospect,
presenting a priority target for exploration (Cazaly news release 27 February 2017: "Widespread
Gold & Zinc Mineralisation Defined").
In addition to the attractiveness of the Project for gold, it is considered prospective for base metals
and platinum group elements. Historical exploration work including auger geochemistry and
geophysical surveys identified several targets for copper, nickel and zinc mineralisation. Several of
these targets remain untested due to historical funding and land access constraints. Exploration in
the belt to the immediate south of the Project area is noted to have intersected copper mineralisation
of significant grade over a significant strike length (4).
In summary, the Project is located within a prolific gold district and has a favourable lithological
Project Summary Com
and structural setting. A solid database of base-level historical exploration work by previous
operators, including generation of drill-ready targets, provides a good platform for Sarama to
advance the Project in conjunction with its activities at the Cosmo Project. The size and
prospectivity of the landholding that Sarama will have in the Laverton Gold District upon
completion of this transaction significantly enhances the chances of making an economic
discovery, particularly given the infrastructure and proliferation of mines in the region which will
have a favourable impact on the size threshold for finding something of economic value.

the Transaction, whichever is earlier. In return for this right of exclusivity, Sarama has agreed to make
a non-refundable cash payment of A$20,000. During this time, Sarama has undertaken to make
payments on behalf of Orbminco for annual exploration licence government rental fees totalling
approximately A$39,900 to ensure continuity of tenure for two of the exploration licences subject of
the Transaction.
The Transaction is an arm's length acquisition which is expected to constitute an Expedited
Acquisition pursuant to TSX Venture Exchange Policy 5.3 - Acquisitions and Disposition of Non-Cash
Assets. No finder's fees will be paid in connection with the completion of the Transaction.
Completion of the Transaction will be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Sarama of the
following key conditions:
execution of a definitive binding agreement for the Transaction;
receipt of Orbminco Board and shareholder approval for the Transaction, if required;
receipt of TSX Venture Exchange final acceptance of the Transaction and issuance of the
Consideration Securities;
receipt of Sarama Board and shareholder approval for the issue of the CDIs as consideration
for the Transaction;
complete assignment of all applicable Native Title Access Agreements affecting the Project;
execution of an assignment deed/agreement by Yamarna and Cazaly for Yamarna's interest in
the Project JV;
receipt of confirmation by Orbminco that it has not novated, assigned or otherwise changed
the structure or holding of Yamarna's interest in the JV or Project from the date of its entry into
the JV;
receipt of unconditional guarantee by Orbminco that it will be responsible for any debts and
liabilities that have been incurred by Yamarna in relation to the Project JV up to the date of
completion of the Transaction; and
receipt of government extension/renewal notices covering new annual periods for tenements
E38/3150 and E38/3581.
Project Joint Venture Structure
The Project is currently in exploration phase and is operated by Yamarna as an unincorporated joint
venture in which Yamarna and Cazaly hold interests of 80% and 20% respectively. The JV
agreement grants Yamarna exclusive right of access to the Project to conduct exploration and
feasibility activities. The JV agreement currently covers mineral tenements E38/3111, E38/3150 and
E38/3581 for a total area of approximately 418km².
At present, Yamarna is responsible for all costs incurred by the JV until the completion of a Pre-
Feasibility Study on the Project (the "Free Carry Period"). At that point, Cazaly may elect to start
contributing its pro-rata share of future JV expenditure to maintain its 20% interest, or alternatively,
elect to withdraw from the JV. In the event that Cazaly withdraws, its interest will be transferred to
Yamarna and it will be granted a 2% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty on minerals extracted from
the Project.
Following the end of the Free Carry Period and in the event Cazaly has elected to contribute its pro
rata share of Project costs, the JV participants will be subject to industry standard ‘contribute or
dilute' provisions in respect of their interests. In the event a JV participant's interest falls below 5%, it
will be deemed to have withdrawn from the JV and its interest automatically converted to a 2% NSR
royalty on minerals extracted from the Project.
The JV agreement includes customary protections for the participants associated with, but not
limited to, surrender of mineral tenements, disposals of JV property and assets, material revisions to
approved work programs and budgets, change of operatorship and decision to mine.

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
Information in this news release that is not a statement of historical fact constitutes forward-looking
information. Such forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding
the prospectivity of the Mt Venn and Cosmo Projects, information with respect to Sarama's planned
exploration activities, having or acquiring mineral interests in areas which are considered highly
prospective for gold and other commodities and which remain underexplored, costs and timing of
future exploration, the potential for exploration discoveries and generation of targets, the intention to
gain the best commercial outcome for shareholders of the Company, timing and receipt of various
approvals, consents and permits under applicable legislation and the completion of a transaction to
acquire an interest in the Mt Venn Project. Actual results, performance or achievements of the
Company may vary from the results suggested by such forward-looking statements due to known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, among others, that the
business of exploration for gold and other precious minerals involves a high degree of risk and is
highly speculative in nature; Mineral Resources are not mineral reserves, they do not have
demonstrated economic viability, and there is no certainty that they can be upgraded to mineral
reserves through continued exploration; few properties that are explored are ultimately developed
into producing mines; geological factors; the actual results of current and future exploration; changes
in project parameters as plans continue to be evaluated, as well as those factors disclosed in the
Company's publicly filed documents.
There can be no assurance that any mineralisation that is discovered will be proven to be economic,
or that future required regulatory licensing or approvals will be obtained. However, the Company
believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking information are
reasonable. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the Company's ability to
carry on its exploration activities, the sufficiency of funding, the timely receipt of required approvals,
the price of gold and other precious metals, that the Company will not be affected by adverse
political and security-related events, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and
effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain further financing as and when required
and on reasonable terms. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
Sarama does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except as required by
applicable laws.
