ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
MEDIA RELEASE
29 November 2024
Transformational Gold and Copper Project Acquisition
in the Lachlan Fold Belt
• Adavale has made an all-scrip acquisition of a 72.5% interest in the Parkes Gold and Copper
Project (the ‘Project’) located in the prolific Lachlan Fold Belt of central New South Wales.
• Adavale has acquired a 395km2 tenement holding, encompassing a geological setting that is
considered highly prospective for structurally-controlled gold and porphyry copper-gold
mineralisation.
• The Project is located at the intersection of the crustal-scale Lachlan Transverse Zone
structural corridor with Early Ordovician-age Macquarie Arc Volcanics. The Project is adjacent
to the Northparkes porphyry-hosted copper-gold mine (5.2Moz Au & 4.4Mt Cu) [ASX:EVN] and
in a similar tectono-stratigraphic setting to the world-class Cadia-Ridgeway copper-gold
porphyry deposits (35Moz Au & 7.9Mt Cu) [ASX:NEM].
• The key Project asset is the historical London-Victoria gold mine in EL 7242, which has an
Historical Estimate of 3.70Mt @ 1.04g/t Au for 124koz gold1 **.
• A diamond drillhole on EL7242 was completed in November 2024 to test the depth potential of
the London-Victoria gold deposit, intersected a possible 12m-thick down-dip extension of the
deposit 250m below surface and 150m below the bottom of the pit. Assays are currently
pending.
• Highest priority exploration target is the Ashes Prospect, located 12km east of the Northparkes
mine in EL 8831. It comprises an untested historical 200m-long, north-striking, up to 7.8%
copper5 and 8.8g/t gold2 rock chip sample geochemical anomaly 200m east across strike from
a yet to be fully resolved historical IP chargeability anomaly. Ashes is considered highly
prospective for porphyry copper-gold mineralisation.
• Modern techniques and advances in geochemistry targeting further enhance the regional
potential of the wider Project area.
**Cautionary Statement: Readers are cautioned that the Historical Estimate for the London-Victoria deposit referred to in
this Announcement is not reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. A Competent Person has not undertaken
sufficient work to classify the Historical Estimate as a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. Nothing
has come to the attention of Adavale that causes it to question the accuracy or the reliability of the former owner’s Historical
Estimate. However, Adavale has not independently validated the former owner’s estimate and therefore is not to be regarded
as reporting, adopting or endorsing the estimate. Following evaluation and further exploration work, it is uncertain whether
it will be possible to report the Historical Estimate as a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The
Historical Estimate has been reported in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. Refer to Appendix 1 for further information.

provide detail of the announcement on 5 December 2024 at 11.30am (AEDT) / 8.30am (AWST)
Adavale Resources Limited [ASX:ADD] (‘Adavale’ or the ‘Company’), a multi-resource mining
company operating in both Australia and Tanzania, is pleased to advise that the Company has
acquired a 72.5% interest in the Parkes Gold and Copper Project (the ‘Parkes Project’ or the ‘Project’)
in the Lachlan Fold Belt of central New South Wales, Australia. The Project comprises four exploration
tenements for a total area of 395km2, that are prospective for orogenic, epithermal and gold-rich
porphyry-style copper-gold deposits.
The Project area is located within the prolific gold and copper producing Macquarie Arc portion of the
Lachlan Fold Belt in central NSW. The Exploration Licences (‘EL’s’) are situated where Early
Ordovician-age Junee-Narromine Volcanic Belt rocks of the western part of the Arc are intersected
by the crustal-scale structural corridor of the Lachlan Transverse Zone (‘LTZ’). Significantly, the LTZ
is host to Tier 1 gold and copper mines, such as Northparkes (5.2Moz Au & 4.4Mt Cu) and Cadia-
Ridgeway (35.1Moz Au & 7.9Mt Cu) where it intersects Macquarie Arc rocks (Figure 1).
The Parkes Project’s most advanced prospect is the former London-Victoria Gold Mine which saw
estimated historical production by BHP Gold and Hargraves of 200,000 to 250,000 ounces at a head
grade of 1.5-2g/t Au. A non-JORC Historical Estimate of 3.7Mt at 1.04g/t Au for 123.8koz Au is
defined for London-Victoria (Refer to Cautionary Statement and see Reference 1 – Agricultural Equity
Investments 2011). At London-Victoria, it is intended to utilise the existing drillhole database,
augmented by a small number of new well-targeted deeper holes, to estimate a Mineral Resource.
This opportunity comes at relatively low cost and at a time of record gold prices.

Macquarie Arc Group. Note the Project’s proximity adjacent to the Northparkes mine at the intersection of the Lachlan
Transverse Zone with the Junee-Narromine Volcanic Belt.
Adavale’s Executive Chairman and CEO, Allan Ritchie commented:
“We are absolutely thrilled to announce this transformational gold and copper project acquisition
with significant upside, located in the Tier 1 jurisdiction of the Lachlan Fold Belt in NSW, near
Parkes. The Parkes Project contains four granted licences with advanced gold and copper
prospects and drill-ready targets identified in three of the Licenses. A diamond drill hole was also
recently completed with assays currently pending.
The Project is located adjacent to the giant Northparkes mine (ASX:EVN) that hosts 5.2Moz Au
and 4.4Mt Cu, is along strike of the Tomingley mine (ASX:ALK) with 2.3Moz Au and not far from
the world-class Cadia mine (ASX:NEM) with 35.1 Moz Au and 7.9Mt Cu.
Adavale has the London-Victoria deposit with an Historical Estimate of 124koz Au. We are very
excited about the deposit’s exploration potential and we see significant scope to increase the
resource. We also have 3 other licences with abundant gold and copper targets.
We are also very pleased with the support received for this Placement and welcome all our new
investors. The company is now well-funded to advance exploration at the Parkes Project and
commence our maiden drilling program at our uranium prospects in South Australia once we
receive the final necessary approval. There is a lot of exciting work ahead of us and we look
forward to providing regular updates to all shareholders.”

LONDON-VICTORIA GOLD MINE - NOVEMBER 2024 DIAMOND DRILLING
An angled 453m-long diamond core hole (AEIDD001) was drilled by the Vendor in November 2024
to test the down-dip depth potential of the London-Victoria gold deposit. The hole targeted the deposit
approximately 250m below surface and 150m below the bottom of the pit.
AEIDD001 was drilled –55o towards the west with an anticipated target, target depth of 340m
downhole. The hole intersected a prospective 12m-wide zone of quartz-carbonate veining and
shearing in pyrite-sericite altered andesitic volcanoclastic rock from 339m to 351m. The intercept is
broadly consistent with the geology, thickness, structure and alteration assemblage, exhibited by the
ore that was mined at the bottom of the London-Victoria pit by BHP Gold and Hargraves in the 1980’s
and 1990’s.
The drill core appears to be mineralised however no inferences can be drawn from these observations
about the gold grade of this intersection at present. Assay results for AEIDD001 are pending and will
be reported in full by Adavale as soon as they become available.
Figure 2 displays a satellite image showing AEIDD001’s location relative to the London-Victoria pit. A
photo of the drill core from the potential down-dip extension interval of the London-Victoria deposit
intersected in AEIDD001 is provided in Figure 3.
Further information about this hole can be found in Appendix 2.

quartz-carbonate veining and shearing in sericite-pyrite altered andesitic volcanoclastic rock intersected 339 to 351m
downhole, which is thought to be the down-dip extension of the London-Victoria deposit. Core tray length is 1m.
OTHER PROSPECTS
Other prospects in the Project area include Ashes, Myalls, Corner, Parkvale, Cunich and Birthday
Mine. These prospects have had minimal or no drill testing but have recorded numerous high-grade
polymetallic rock chip sampling assay results with which to guide initial exploration activities. Key drill
intercepts and rock chips from the prospects are presented in Table 1.
The ‘walk up’ Ashes, Myalls and Corner Prospects are within tenement EL 8831; adjacent to and
approximately 10km east of the Northparkes mine which contains an endowment of 5.2Moz Au and
4.4Mt Cu. These prospects share similar geology to Northparkes, as well as significant gold, silver
and copper assay results in rock chip samples from the prospects, representing compelling
exploration targets worthy of early follow-up by the Company (Figures 4 and 5).
Ashes is a particularly compelling porphyry copper-gold target as it comprises an untested, historical,
200m-long, north-striking, up to 7.3% copper5 and 8.8g/t gold2 rock chip sample geochemical
anomaly situated 200m east across strike from a yet to be resolved historical IP chargeability anomaly
and 400m south-west of historical end-of-auger-hole diamond core tails that intersected monzonite
which is the felsic intrusive lithology that hosts the Northparkes deposits6.
In addition to these prospects, there is still additional potential to make further discoveries in the
Project area. This is primarily due to advances in modern exploration geochemistry techniques,
including lower detection limits and more comprehensive assay methods, in addition to advances in
pathfinder element footprint vectoring for finding new deposits.

Appendix 1
Schedule 1 - Details of Historical Estimate in relation to ASX LR Chapter 5.
Sections 5.10 to 5.12. Requirements applicable to reports of historical estimates and foreign estimates
of mineralisation for material mining projects.
ASX Listing Rule 5.10 - An entity reporting historical estimates or foreign estimates of mineralisation in
relation to a material mining project to the public is not required to comply with rule 5.6 (The JORC
Code) provided the entity complies with rules 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14.
For the non-JORC Historical Estimate included in this market release, Adavale is not required to comply with
Listing Rule 5.6 (JORC Code) as all relevant and requested disclosures are stated in the report and tabulated
below. The Company complies with 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14 requirements for statement of non-JORC historical
resource estimates, as tabled below.
Listing Rule 5.11 - An entity must not include historical estimates or foreign estimates (other than
qualifying foreign estimates) of mineralisation in an economic analysis (including a scoping study,
preliminary feasibility study, or a feasibility study) of the entity’s mineral resources and ore reserves
holdings.
Adavale is not applying any economic analysis or commentary to the Historical Estimate referred to in this
market release.
Listing Rule 5.12 - Subject to rule 5.13 an entity reporting historical estimates or foreign estimates of
mineralisation in relation to a material mining project must include all of the following information in a
market announcement and give it to ASX for release to the market.
Listing Rule 5.12 sets out the parameters whereby Historical Estimates can be reported on the ASX.
Accordingly, in addition to the disclosure in the body of this announcement, Adavale provides the following
information regarding the Historical Estimate for the London-Victoria deposit.
5.12.1 – The source and date of the Historical Estimate of mineralisation.
The Historical Estimate of 3.70Mt at 1.04 g/t Au for 124k oz Au (‘London-Victoria Historical Estimate’) is
contained in the report titled: ‘Agricultural Equity Investments Pty Limited, Exploration Licence 7242, “Parkes”,
Third Annual Exploration Progress Report, for the period 7th November 2010 – 6th November 2011”. This, and
related, reports can be found in the Geoscience NSW public database (DIGS) as report RE0002336
(GS2012/0015). The Company estimates that 100% of this estimate is located within the properties it controls.
5.12.2 – Whether the historical resource estimates of mineralisation use categories of mineralisation
other than those defined in JORC Code 2012 and if so, an explanation of the differences.
The London Victoria Historical Estimate uses Indicated, Inferred and Total categories of mineralisation; the
same as those defined under the JORC Code 2012.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.3 – The relevance and materiality of the Historical Estimates of mineralisation to
the entity.
The London-Victoria historical Estimate is considered by Adavale to be relevant and of significant materiality to
an assessment of the value of the Parkes Gold and Copper Project as it provides an indication of scale and
grade as well as a level of context and background for the potential development of the Project.
14

ASX Listing Rule 5.12.4 – The reliability of the Historical Estimate of mineralisation, including reference
to any criteria in Table 1 of JORC Code 2012 which are relevant to understanding of the reliability of the
Historical Estimate.
It is the opinion of Adavale that the 2011 Historical Estimate, which was made using Datamine software by an
experienced consultant geologist and peer reviewed by a mining engineer and a second geologist, is reliable
and represents the results of work done to reasonable standards.
Regarding the specific criteria in JORC Table 1 – namely Sampling Techniques and Data, Reporting of
Exploration Results, and Estimation and Reporting of Mineral Resources – all relevant and available information
is contained in the Agricultural Equity Investments Annual Report referenced above.
Appendix 3 contains further information with reference to the criteria in Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Table 1 of the
JORC Code, to the extent considered relevant to understanding the reliability of the Historical Estimate referred
to in this announcement.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.5 – To the extent known, a summary of the work programs on which the Historical
Estimates of mineralisation is based and a summary of the key assumptions, mining and processing
parameters and methods used to prepare historical resource estimates of mineralisation.
All relevant and available information is contained in the Agricultural Equity Investments Annual Report
referenced above.
In summary, the London-Victoria area has been extensively explored and drilled, prior to, during and after open-
pit mining (1988-1995) by previous owners Alkane Resources, BHP Gold, Newcrest Mining and Hargraves
Resources. Information for the Historical Estimate model was collated by these owners, as well as subsequent
owners Michelago Resources / Sipa Resources, Golden Cross Resources and Agricultural Equity Investments.
The historical pit shape has a NNE strike of 1.6km and a width of up to 170m, with depth to 150m; the resource
is focused on remnant material in the pit walls and floor to an additional depth of approximately 100m.
The Historical Estimate was based on a database of more than 1000 drill holes (RAB, RC and DC), exceeding
35km of drilling. It is reported using a cutoff grade of 0.5g/t Au. Grade interpolation was performed using
Ordinary Kriging into 12.5x4x5m parent cells.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.6 – Any more recent estimates or data relevant to the reported mineralisation
available to the entity.
Adavale is not aware of any recent estimates or data relevant to the London-Victoria property.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.7 – The evaluation and/or exploration work that needs to be completed to verify
the Historical Estimate of mineralisation as a Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with
the JORC Code 2012.
Adavale has commenced a program of evaluation work that includes verification of historical drillhole data and
other geological work. Resource definition drilling will also be completed by Adavale to support a JORC 2012
Mineral Resource estimate for the London-Victoria deposit. Prior to estimating a Mineral Resource, the
Company will undertake its own resource evaluation work as required under the 2012 JORC Code which will
include site visits, geological interpretation, data assimilation, new estimation and modelling techniques,
assessment of relevant environmental factors and assumptions regarding mining methods, processing and
potential dilution.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.8 – The proposed timing of any evaluation and/or exploration work that the entity
intends to undertake and a comment on how the entity intends to fund that work.
The Company will complete resource definition work following the completion of a data review and after
acquiring any required permits. It is working towards conducting an initial drilling program in 2025. The drilling
will be funded through the capital raising as announced.
