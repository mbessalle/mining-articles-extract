The Project consists of 89 unpatented mineral claims totaling approximately 1,780 acres.

(\"<b>Alta</b>\") in the early-to-mid 1990s resulted in the discovery of the nearby Hammer Ridge deposit. A total of 214 drill holes totaling 62,768 feet (19,137 metres) were drilled to delineate both deposits at the Project and a mine plan was generated and approved in 1997 (see Figure 2). </p><p>Alta reported production of 62,661 ounces of gold from the two deposits between 1998 and 1999. A proposed expansion of the Hammer Ridge pit was being pursued by Alta when it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1999 after suffering unsustainable losses incurred during the startup of its Olinghouse Mine, near Reno, Nevada. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2799/241637_91b9f4189425fbf0_002full.jpg\"><img src=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2799/241637_91b9f4189425fbf0_002.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" alt=\"Cannot view this image?

In conjunction with computer modeling, the Company believes that the application of modern ground geophysics and leading-edge soil geochemical surveys could assist in determining new target areas at the Project. The only application of modern geophysics at Griffon consisted of a gravity survey completed in 2012 that assisted in mapping many of the complex structures observed in the results. Nevada Sunrise is currently soliciting a bid for an Induced Polarization/Resistivity survey for integration with the 2012 gravity data, and plans to carry out conventional and Soil Gas Hydrocarbon soil surveys over the interpreted structures to optimize new drill targets at Griffon (see Figure 4). </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2799/241637_91b9f4189425fbf0_004full.jpg\"><img src=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2799/241637_91b9f4189425fbf0_004.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Hamilton : The subject of a transaction with an emerging public company, Bendito Resources Inc., which hosts Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of 545,000 oz. gold and 4,459,600 oz. silver contained within Measured and Indicated resources of 727,000 oz. gold and 6,569,000 oz. silver, and Inferred resources of 119,000 oz, gold and 1,153,000 oz. silver 4 ; Green Springs : Owned by Orla Mining Ltd., and currently under option to Centerra Gold Inc. Historical production at Green Springs of 63,000 oz. of gold was reported from 1988 to 1991 under USMX Inc.'s heap leach operation 5 ; Lookout Mountain : Operated by Timberline Resources Corporation, a fully-owned subsidiary of McEwen Mining Inc., which hosts Measured and Indicated resources of 423,000 oz. gold, and Inferred resources of 84,000 oz. gold. Historical production of 17,700 oz. gold was reported in 1987. 6 References: 1 NI 43-101 Updated Technical Report on Resources and Reserves, Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada, prepared by SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. and Apex Geoscience Ltd., with an effective date December 31, 2022; 2 Calibre Mining Corp., News Release dated January 8, 2025; 3 Amended Technical Report on the Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Gold Rock Project, White Pine County, Nevada, prepared by Fiore Gold Ltd. by Apex Geoscience Ltd. and John T.

History of Exploration Griffon is located in a mining district that received little historical exploration or mining activity until the late 1980s when the area was explored by Shell Oil and Placer Dome U.S. Inc. Subsequent exploration by Billiton Minerals identified the Discovery Ridge deposit and following its discovery in 1988, several mining companies alternately controlled Griffon prior to the commencement of gold production. Definition drilling by Alta Gold Co. (\" Alta \") in the early-to-mid 1990s resulted in the discovery of the nearby Hammer Ridge deposit. A total of 214 drill holes totaling 62,768 feet (19,137 metres) were drilled to delineate both deposits at the Project and a mine plan was generated and approved in 1997 (see Figure 2). Alta reported production of 62,661 ounces of gold from the two deposits between 1998 and 1999. A proposed expansion of the Hammer Ridge pit was being pursued by Alta when it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1999 after suffering unsustainable losses incurred during the startup of its Olinghouse Mine, near Reno, Nevada.

Two drill holes showed significant gold values (Source: Fremont Gold Ltd. News Release dated July 21, 2020) : Hole GF20-03 intersected 1.05 grams/tonne (\"g/t\") gold over 50.3 metres beginning at 29.0 metres depth, including 1.57 g/t gold over 7.5 metres; Hole GF-20-2 intersected 0.30 g/t gold over 30.0 metres beginning at 15.0 metres depth, including 0.71 g/t gold over 8.0 metres. Griffon is described in historical geological reports available to the Company as a Carlin-type gold deposit model in a very structurally-disturbed area that makes the geological controls of potentially mineralized zones difficult to predict. The sedimentary units present such as the Pilot Shale, Chainman Shale and the Joana Limestone are subject to a number of interpreted fault types with numerous folds, including low-angle thrust, low-angle normal, high-angle normal, and high-angle strike-slip faults that have yet to be comprehensively mapped and understood (see Figure 3).

In conjunction with computer modeling, the Company believes that the application of modern ground geophysics and leading-edge soil geochemical surveys could assist in determining new target areas at the Project. The only application of modern geophysics at Griffon consisted of a gravity survey completed in 2012 that assisted in mapping many of the complex structures observed in the results. Nevada Sunrise is currently soliciting a bid for an Induced Polarization/Resistivity survey for integration with the 2012 gravity data, and plans to carry out conventional and Soil Gas Hydrocarbon soil surveys over the interpreted structures to optimize new drill targets at Griffon (see Figure 4).
