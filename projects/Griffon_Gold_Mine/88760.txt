# Nevada Sunrise Announces Agreement to Purchase a 100% Interest in the Past-Producing Griffon Gold Mine Project, Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - **Nevada Sunrise Metals Corporation (TSXV: NEV) (OTC Pink: NVSGF**) (**"Nevada Sunrise" or the "Company"**) is pleased to announce that it has signed a mining lease purchase agreement (the "Agreement") with an arm's-length vendor for the Griffon Gold Mine Project ("**Griffon** ", or the "**Project** ") located approximately 50 kilometres (33 miles) southwest of Ely, Nevada. The Project consists of 89 unpatented mineral claims totaling approximately 1,780 acres. Griffon is situated at the southern extension of the fertile Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend in east-central Nevada, which is host to both past-producing and operating gold mines, and a number of significant gold deposits. Gold was mined at Griffon in two open pits from 1998 to 1999 and was reported to have produced 62,661 ounces of oxide gold until its premature closure _(Source: Nevada Division of Minerals, "Major Mines of Nevada", published 1998 and 1999)._

"The acquisition of Griffon represents a golden opportunity for Nevada Sunrise," said Warren Stanyer, President and CEO of the Company. "This property has been underexplored for almost three decades and offers good potential to host additional gold resources. As we enter an era of record high gold prices, Nevada Sunrise intends to apply new ideas and modern exploration technologies at Griffon to capitalize on the renewed interest in gold in Nevada, which is recognized as one of the most mining-friendly jurisdictions in the world."

**About Griffon**

Griffon lies within a 60 kilometre (40 mile) section of the Battle Mountain-Eureka trend, that hosts the following gold mines and deposits (see Figure 1):

**Pan Mine** : Operated by Calibre Mining Corp., which hosts Measured and Indicated resources of 358,900 oz. gold and Inferred resources of 42,000 oz. gold1, and was reported as producing 35,267 oz. gold in 20242;

**History of Exploration**

Griffon is located in a mining district that received little historical exploration or mining activity until the late 1980s when the area was explored by Shell Oil and Placer Dome U.S. Inc. Subsequent exploration by Billiton Minerals identified the Discovery Ridge deposit and following its discovery in 1988, several mining companies alternately controlled Griffon prior to the commencement of gold production. 

Definition drilling by Alta Gold Co. ("**Alta** ") in the early-to-mid 1990s resulted in the discovery of the nearby Hammer Ridge deposit. A total of 214 drill holes totaling 62,768 feet (19,137 metres) were drilled to delineate both deposits at the Project and a mine plan was generated and approved in 1997 (see Figure 2). 

Alta reported production of 62,661 ounces of gold from the two deposits between 1998 and 1999. A proposed expansion of the Hammer Ridge pit was being pursued by Alta when it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1999 after suffering unsustainable losses incurred during the startup of its Olinghouse Mine, near Reno, Nevada.

After gold production ended in 1999, Griffon received no further exploration activity until 2020, when Fremont Gold Ltd. drilled nine holes totaling 2,275 metres (7,462 feet) at the Project. Two drill holes showed significant gold values _(Source: Fremont Gold Ltd. News Release dated July 21, 2020)_ :

  * Hole GF20-03 intersected 1.05 grams/tonne ("g/t") gold over 50.3 metres beginning at 29.0 metres depth, including 1.57 g/t gold over 7.5 metres;

  * Hole GF-20-2 intersected 0.30 g/t gold over 30.0 metres beginning at 15.0 metres depth, including 0.71 g/t gold over 8.0 metres.




Griffon is described in historical geological reports available to the Company as a Carlin-type gold deposit model in a very structurally-disturbed area that makes the geological controls of potentially mineralized zones difficult to predict. The sedimentary units present such as the Pilot Shale, Chainman Shale and the Joana Limestone are subject to a number of interpreted fault types with numerous folds, including low-angle thrust, low-angle normal, high-angle normal, and high-angle strike-slip faults that have yet to be comprehensively mapped and understood (see Figure 3).

Nevada Sunrise has received a digital database containing all of the 1990s drill holes and intends to re-process and computer model the drilling data for a better understanding of the stratigraphies that may host gold mineralization outside of the two historical pits. In conjunction with computer modeling, the Company believes that the application of modern ground geophysics and leading-edge soil geochemical surveys could assist in determining new target areas at the Project. The only application of modern geophysics at Griffon consisted of a gravity survey completed in 2012 that assisted in mapping many of the complex structures observed in the results. Nevada Sunrise is currently soliciting a bid for an Induced Polarization/Resistivity survey for integration with the 2012 gravity data, and plans to carry out conventional and Soil Gas Hydrocarbon soil surveys over the interpreted structures to optimize new drill targets at Griffon (see Figure 4).

The Company retains the right to purchase a 100% interest in Griffon, subject to a 2.0% net smelter returns royalty ("**NSR** ") with certain buydown provisions, in consideration for the cash payments to the vendors and minimum exploration expenditures as described in the table below (all dollar amounts listed are in US dollars): 

**Schedule of Cash Payments and Exploration Expenditures**

**Payment**  
**Due Dates**| **Cash**  
**Payments**| **Minimum**  
**Exploration**  
**Expenditures**  
---|---|---  
Feb. 13, 2025|  $25,000 (paid)| $150,000
