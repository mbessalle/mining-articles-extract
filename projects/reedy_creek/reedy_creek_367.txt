About Great Pacific Gold
Great Pacific Gold has a portfolio of exploration stage projects in Papua New Guinea ("PNG") and
Australia. The Company is focused on developing gold-copper resources from its highly prospective
land packages. Its core projects include:
Kesar – located in the Eastern Highlands province of PNG and contiguous with K92 Mining's
mine tenements, Kesar is a greenfield exploration project with several high priority targets in
close proximity to the property boundary with K92. Multiple epithermal veins at Kesar are on
strike and have the same orientation of key K92 deposits such as Kora. Exploration work to
date by GPAC at Kesar has shown that these veins have high grades of gold present in
outcrop and very elevated gold in soil grades, coincident with aeromagnetic highs. Project Summary Com
Arau – located in Eastern Highlands province of PNG, the Arau Project contains the highly
prospective Mt. Victor exploration target with potential for a high sulphidation epithermal gold-
base metal deposit. A Phase 1 Reverse Circulation drilling program was completed at Mt.
Victor in August 2024, with results pending. The Arau project includes the Elandora licence
which also contains various epithermal and copper-gold porphyry targets.
Wild Dog – located in the East New Britain province of PNG, Wild Dog is a brownfield
exploration project with a history of small-scale gold mining. The project contains numerous

epithermal and porphyry hydrothermal-magmatic targets evidenced by previous exploration

the project has been established for baseline environmental and exploration work.
