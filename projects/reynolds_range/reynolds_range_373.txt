ASX RELEASE
25 July 2024
Reynolds Range Project Background
The Reynolds Range project consists of three Exploration Licences, currently being acquired by
iTech Minerals Ltd, of which Prodigy Gold NL (ASX: PRX) holds 100% of two licences and 80% of
another, the 20% of this license is owned by Select Resources Pty Ltd (Select) (Figure 1). The project
covers a total of 375 km2 of the Aileron Province, part of the Paleoproterozoic North Australian Craton.
The Project is located 90-230km NNW of Alice Springs with access available from the Stuart Highway
and then the un-sealed Mt Denison road. The new tenement application EL 23888, covers 416 km2
and is adjacent to the south and east of the three existing tenements.
Reynolds Range Tenement Application
In late May, Managing Director Michael Schwarz and fellow ITM Director Gary Ferris visited the
Reynolds Range Project to assess the potential for copper and gold mineralisation across the project
area, following a recently completed review of historical exploration. Having travelled across the full
70km of strike of the Reynolds Range tenement package, the directors were impressed by the
widespread scale gold, copper-gold-silver and potential for lithium mineralisation, with outcropping
pegmatites mapped at over 1.4 km long and 100m wide.
Vacant ground was identified, to the south and east of the tenement being investigated, which
captured the same geological trends and prospectivity identified in the historical review and
reconnaissance field trip. iTech was able to successfully lodge a tenement application over the most
prospective ground in the form of EL 33881, adding an additional 416 km2 to the 375 km2 of tenure
currently being acquired from Prodigy Gold NL.

rock chip samples taken.
iTech’s Managing Director, Mike Schwarz, is currently in the field with iTech geologists following up
the latest gold, copper-gold-silver and lithium rock chip results, visiting newly identified prospects
and assessing the potential of the new tenement application. Additional rock chip results from this
program are expected to be available in the next 5-6 weeks.
