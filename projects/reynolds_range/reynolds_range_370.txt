Completion of iTech Energy’s Acquisition of the Reynolds Range Project  
Prodigy Gold NL (ASX:PRX) (“Prodigy Gold” or “Company”) is pleased to advise that the two 
binding Tenement Sale and Purchase Agreements (SPA) with iTech Energy Pty Ltd (“iTech”), a 
wholly owned subsidiary of iTech Minerals Ltd (ASX: ITM), to acquire 100% of Prodigy Gold’s 
interest in three tenements in the Reynolds Range area are now complete. The acquisition by 
iTech was originally announced on 23 February 2024. 
Managing Director Mark Edwards said: “Prodigy Gold wishes iTech the best of success 
exploring the Reynolds Range project. The divestment is in line with Prodigy Gold’s strategy to 
divest assets the Company considers non-core. Reduced tenement holding cost and the receipt 
of the consideration will allow Prodigy Gold to fund exploration on its 100% owned gold 
projects in the Tanami North project area. 
We are excited for iTech to develop the Reynolds Range project and the agreed royalty will 
allow Prodigy Gold to partake in any potential upside if a mine is developed on the project 
area.”   
The first SPA covers EL23888 & EL28083 (SPA 1) and the second SPA covers EL23655 (SPA 2) 
with all conditions precedent now completed for both SPA’s.

The Reynolds Range project is accessed from the Stuart Highway 90km north of Alice Springs. 
Proximity to infrastructure is good, with targets located between 20km and 120km off the NT 
highway, railway line (Ghan) and the NT gas pipeline. This project has excellent access and is 
located on pastoral lease. The project contains several prospects considered to be prospective 
for gold, copper and silver.
