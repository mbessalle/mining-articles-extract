Recently granted exploration licence EL11/2024 comprises 37km2 of ground directly adjoining the
northeastern margin of CPER's EL8/2023 (Razorback) and the southern boundary of EL16/2018
Project Name
(Walford Peak). The Company has been granted the exploration licence for a period of 5 years
(renewable) commencing 19th November 2024. EL11/2024 covers highly prospective ground Skyline Project
adjacent to the Tyennan Margin Fault and the NW-trending Linda Transfer Zone (Figure 2) within
2km of the Mt Lyell Cu-Au camp currently owned by Sibanye-Stillwater and currently the subject of
a re-start feasibility study.
The Company is currently undertaking detailed technical reviews of the property, however,
preliminary work demonstrates that the EL11/2024 hosts magnetic and gravity anomalies, plus
structures and alteration that are consistent with similar significant anomalies within the Razorback-
Skyline trend. Planning and permitting is in progress for exploration programs anticipated to
commence in 2025.
Expanded Skyline Project
Granting of EL11/2024 has expanded the Company's Skyline Project (Figure 1) group of 100%
owned licences (also including EL16/2018, EL24/2020, EL8/2023 and EL14/2023) to now cover a
