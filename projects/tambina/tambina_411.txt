Tambourah Adds Advanced Tambina Gold Project 
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• Tambina Gold Project (P45/3205) has recently been granted to Tambourah Metals. 
• Extensive, shallow palaeo-placer gold target at base of Fortescue Group (combined 4000m 
strike). 
• Historic bulk surface samples and trenches of weathered Fe-oxide conglomerate units reported 
multiple anomalous sites of greater than 1g/t Au, including grades of up to 62g/t Au from an 
anomalous unit extending for over 500m along the eastern margin of P45/32051. 
• Host units are interpreted to dip moderately to shallowly and are 2-3 m in thickness.  Supergene 
enrichment of gold near surface in ferruginous weathered pyritic conglomerate presents an 
attractive opportunity for gold recovery. 
 
Tambourah Metal Ltd (ASX:TMB) is pleased to provide an update on the Tambina Gold Project 
following the grant of P45/3205, which represents an amalgamation of two historic mining leases 
(M45/988 & M45/991) explored for stratabound palaeo-placer gold mineralisation. 
The Tambina Gold Project is located approximately 75km southwest of Marble Bar in Western 
Australia and 17km north of the Tambourah Gold Project and adjacent to E45/6032, where the 
Company is exploring for gold, lithium and critical minerals. The hosting geological sequence includes 
rocks of the lower Fortescue Group that are folded into a south-southeast trending basin with 
approximate dimensions of 7.5km long by 1.5km wide (see Figures 1 and 2). 
 
Historic exploration within the tenement includes geological mapping, trenching, rock and soil 
sampling and RC drilling. This work identified coarse gold associated with extensive and continuous 
ferruginous conglomerate units within the sedimentary sequence and bulk sampling methods have 
been employed to mitigate problems associated with reliability of assay grades due to the presence 
of coarse gold.  
 
Grades of up to 62.2g/t Au from rock chip samples and visible gold in panned concentrates were 
reported from irregularly spaced sampling of ferruginous conglomerate by West Wits Mining within 
P45/3205. This work outlined a prospective target over approximately 500m of strike on the east 
limb of the folded sequence The target is coincident with a >200ppb gold in soil anomaly identified 
by Talga Resources in 2012 (see Figure 1).

The Tambina Gold Project legacy data has identified a significant gold target associated with 
ferruginous conglomerate units. Tambourah will prepare an exploration program to systematically  
determine  the potential grade and extent of the gold mineralisation at Tambina and resume 
mapping and follow up drilling along the northern contact of the Tambina Supersuite to advance 
exploration for gold and critical minerals.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1: 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down hole gamma 
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge 
for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg 
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure 
of detailed information. 
• 
Soil and rock chip sampling was conducted 
on the Tambina Gold Project, WA by Talga 
Resources (2011-2012) and West Wits 
Mining (2018) respectively. For soil samples 
the surface samples were sieved to -1mm in 
the field (sample weight not reported). Rock 
chip samples were comprised of 3, 7kg 
samples with a combined weight of 
approximately 20kg collected over a 
maximum distance of up to 16m. Rock 
samples were collected by geological pick as 
channel samples over measured intervals, 
generally 
along 
the 
strike 
of 
the 
conglomerate unit. 
• 
There is no reference to duplicate sampling 
for soil sampling. Bulk rock samples of up to 
20kg, composited from 3 individual 7kg 
samples were collected from each site. A 
sample was collected from one half of the 
measured interval, another from the 
second half of the measured interval and a 
third from over the entire interval. Clearing 
of  surface debris was carried out before 
sampling. 
• 
Coarse gold has been reported from the 
Tambina Gold Project, with resultant poor 
reproduction of rock chip grades. Bulk 
sampling of 20kg was employed to mitigate 
the “nugget effect”.  
• 
Rock and soil samples were forwarded to 
ALS Laboratories in Perth, Western 
Australia. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, 
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of 
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc). 
• 
No drilling to report. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature 
of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse 
material. 
• 
No drilling to report.

Commentary 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
level of detail to support appropriate 
Mineral Resource estimation, mining 
studies and metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the 
relevant intersections logged. 
• 
Rock chip samples were described in the 
field 
by 
the 
geologist 
and 
located 
specifically within ferruginous horizons of 
conglomeratic units. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, 
rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet 
or dry. 
• 
For all sample types, the nature, quality 
and appropriateness of the sample 
preparation technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all 
sub-sampling stages to maximise 
representivity of samples. 
• 
Measures taken to ensure that the 
sampling is representative of the in situ 
material collected, including for instance 
results for field duplicate/second-half 
sampling. 
• 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to 
the grain size of the material being 
sampled. 
• 
No drilling to report. 
• 
No drilling to report. 
• 
Soil samples were sieved to -1mm in the 
field and submitted for assay. There is no 
information on the sample preparation 
method. Bulk rock samples were crushed 
rotary split to obtain a 1kg sub-sample 
(crush to 70% <2mm, rotary split off 1kg, 
pulverise to 85% passing 75microns. 
• 
Laboratory reporting of replicate samples. 
• 
No record of field duplicate sampling.  
• 
Rock chip sampling recognised the presence 
of coarse gold. Results from within the 
individual 
sample 
sites 
vary 
greatly, 
including the third sample over the total 
interval. These results suggest that the 
sample size is insufficient to represent the 
sampled interval.   
Quality of assay 
data and 
laboratory tests 
• 
The nature, quality and appropriateness of 
the assaying and laboratory procedures 
used and whether the technique is 
considered partial or total. 
• 
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, 
handheld XRF instruments, etc, the 
parameters used in determining the 
analysis including instrument make and 
model, reading times, calibrations factors 
applied and their derivation, etc. 
• 
Nature of quality control procedures 
adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, 
external laboratory checks) and whether 
acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of 
bias) and precision have been established. 
• 
Soil samples were analysed using a aqua 
regia digest and multi-element ICPMS-OES 
assay at ALS Perth. Gold assays are suitable 
for exploration targeting. The rock samples 
were analysed by ALS using a 50g charge 
and fire assay, considered a total assay for 
gold . 
• 
No geophysical tools were used in the 
assaying of these samples. 
• 
For rock chip sampling no blanks or field 
duplicates were submitted. QAQC was 
performed by the laboratory using replicate 
samples and standards. There is no  
information on the results of these QAQC 
procedures. 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
• 
The verification of significant intersections 
by either independent or alternative 
company personnel. 
• 
The use of twinned holes. 
• 
Documentation of primary data, data entry 
procedures, data verification, data storage 
(physical and electronic) protocols. 
• 
Discuss any adjustment to assay data. 
• 
The assay data has been reviewed but not 
verified the competent person. 
• 
No twinned holes have been drilled at this 
preliminary stage of exploration 
• 
There is no record of data recording or 
storage. 
• 
There has been no adjustment made to the 
reported assay data. 
Location of data 
points 
• 
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to 
locate drill holes (collar and down-hole 
surveys), trenches, mine workings and 
other locations used in Mineral Resource 
estimation. 
• 
No drilling to report, soil sampling did not 
report location method. Rock chip sampling 
used hand-held GPS. 
• 
The soil and rock samples were all located 
using MGA94 Zone 50 coordinate system.

JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
• 
Specification of the grid system used. 
• 
Quality and adequacy of topographic 
control. 
• 
No reference to topographic control, survey 
controlled marks are located at the corners 
of the former ML boundaries. 
Data spacing 
and distribution 
• 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
Whether the data spacing and distribution 
is sufficient to establish the degree of 
geological and grade continuity 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and 
Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and 
classifications applied. 
• 
Whether sample compositing has been 
applied. 
• 
The sample spacing was 100m by 25m for 
soil sampling. Rock samples were collected 
at 
specific 
locations 
identified 
by 
ferruginised outcrops. 
• 
Surface sampling only. 
• 
Composite 
rock 
chip 
samples 
were 
collected as described above. 
Orientation of 
data in relation 
to geological 
structure 
• 
Whether the orientation of sampling 
achieves unbiased sampling of possible 
structures and the extent to which this is 
known, considering the deposit type. 
• 
If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to 
have introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if 
material. 
• 
The orientation of sampling is considered 
appropriate for first pass exploration. 
• 
At the first pass exploration stage there 
does not appear to be any bias introduced 
into the sampling and the geological or 
assay results as a function of the orientation 
of the sampling with respect to the 
geological structure. 
Sample security 
• 
The measures taken to ensure sample 
security. 
• 
There is no reference to methods taken to 
ensure sample security.   
Audits or 
reviews 
• 
The results of any audits or reviews of 
sampling techniques and data. 
• 
There have been no audits conducted on 
the results this far.

P45/3205 has experienced multiple 
phases of exploration activity; 
• 
Texasgulf Exploration (1976) – mapping, 
stream sediment sampling, rock chip 
sampling, bulk sampling of 32 tonnes at 
the Marble Bar State Battery yielded 50g 
gold (av. 1.56g/t Au). 
• 
Goldstream Mining (1986-1991) – 
mapping, rock chip sampling, costeaning 
and RC drilling. 
•

why this is the case. 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (eg cutting of high grades) 
and cut-off grades are usually Material 
and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should 
be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting 
of metal equivalent values should be 
clearly stated. 
• 
There have been no data aggregation 
methods applied to the assay results from 
the original reports. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation 
with respect to the drill hole angle is 
known, its nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down 
hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
No drilling to report.  
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view 
of drill hole collar locations and 
appropriate sectional views. 
• 
No drilling to report. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting 
of Exploration Results. 
• 
Historic surface data, no drilling to 
report.
