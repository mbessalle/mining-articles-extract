25 February 2025 
 
Lakewood Acquisition Drives Gold Acceleration Strategy 
 
 
BLACK CAT SYNDICATE LIMITED (ASX:BC8 and BC8O)  |  0458 007 713  |  admin@bc8.com.au  |  Level 4, 507 Murray Street, Perth WA 6000 
bc8.com.au   |   ABN 63 620 896 282 
 
Black Cat Syndicate Limited (“Black Cat” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce it has entered into a binding 
agreement with Westgold Resources Limited (“Westgold”) to acquire the operating, 1.2Mtpa Lakewood processing facility 
(“Lakewood”). Lakewood is located 6km SE of Kalgoorlie and within 40km of the 100% owned Kal East Gold Operation 
(“Kal East”). The acquisition is subject to completion to occur on or before 31 March 2025. 
 
HIGHLIGHTS (All amounts are A$ unless otherwise shown) 
 
Acquisition of the fully permitted and operating Lakewood processing facility allows Black Cat to produce more gold 
sooner, with expanded throughput capacity of +50% (from 0.8Mtpa to 1.2Mtpa) and brings forward production plans by 
~15-months to take advantage of the high gold price environment. 
 
The consideration of $85M is comprised of $70M in cash, in staged payments over 9 months and $15M in Black Cat 
shares, at an issue price of $0.76 per share and escrowed for 12 months from the date of issue. The cash payable at 
completion is immediately available from existing cash, with future payments to be funded from operating cashflows.  
 
The key terms of the acquisition are outlined in this announcement. 
 
Benefits of the Lakewood acquisition include:  
 
~15-month acceleration of an operating processing facility. 
 
+50% expansion of capacity compared to the Kal East Study (ASX 9 May 2024) to 1.2Mtpa. 
 
Lower risk acquisition compared to procurement, construction and commissioning of a new processing facility. 
 
Proximity to Kalgoorlie means experienced workforce and local service providers and suppliers are available.  
 
Infrastructure in place including grid power, sealed roads, water and a newly commissioned tailings storage facility. 
 
Throughput can be readily increased, beyond 1.2Mtpa, by tying in and commissioning the secondary mill. 
 
Centralised location opens potential for consolidation/tolling of stranded assets. 
 
Planned activities over the coming year at Lakewood include:  
 
Processing of the Company’s Ore. 
 
Potential toll treatment of third-party Ore as spare capacity allows (including from Westgold), whilst mines ramp up. 
 
The acquisition, will enhance the Kal East Study (ASX 9 May 2024) that previously included: 
 
An initial production target of 381koz @ 2.1g/t Au at an average of 51kozpa at 0.8Mtpa processing rate. 
 
64% of the production target was Ore Reserves of 243koz @ 2.0g/t Au (calculated at a gold price of $2,500/oz). 
 
Only 59% of current Resources (1.3Moz @ 2.1g/t Au) were considered in the production target. 
 
Kal East mining activities are now being fast-tracked. Re-optimisation of open pit and underground deposits is already 
underway including Fingals, Majestic, Jones Find, Myhree/Boundary, Imperial and Trojan. 
 
 
Black Cat’s Managing Director, Gareth Solly, said: “This is another transformational step in our plan to produce more gold 
sooner.  The acquisition of the 1.2Mtpa Lakewood processing facility accelerates Kal East by 15 months, eliminating the 
risks associated with construction. 
We have a 1.3Moz Resource base near Lakewood with deposits open along strike and at depth. This acquisition provides 
a pathway to harvest the cash from Kal East, complemented by ongoing drilling and growth. We look forward to running 
Lakewood which is on the doorstep of Kalgoorlie and has previously been pivotal in the growth of Silver Lake Resources 
(now Vault Minerals) and Karora Resources. 
We are thrilled to be able to announce this acquisition as we continue to transform into a significant WA gold miner, 
producing more gold, sooner.”

LAKEWOOD PROCESSING FACILITY   
Since Karora Resources (now Westgold) acquired Lakewood in 2022 the facility has undergone several upgrades 
including: 
 
Installation of a larger 1,850kw motor to the primary mill and 2 additional CIL tanks to increase throughput up to 
1.2Mtpa. 
 
Construction of a new tailings storage facility delivering long term disposal capacity. 
 
Drilling of additional water bores for long term water supply. 
 
Refurbishment of a secondary (~300ktpa) mill to allow throughput capacity to be increased, once tied in and 
commissioned. 
Below are various images of Lakewood and surrounding infrastructure. 
In addition, and subject to completion, the engineering study to build the Kal East processing facility at Majestic has been 
concluded as it will no longer be required. In addition, the Company’s already owned ball mills and supporting infrastructure 
will be retained. These mills will be held for potential installation/upgrade of the Company’s various operations and projects, 
including the Coyote Gold Operation and the Mt Clement Antimony Project.

ABOUT BLACK CAT SYNDICATE (ASX: BC8) 
Black Cat is a gold producer with operating mines and processing facilities at two of its three 100% owned operations. 
Gold production occurs at: 
Paulsens: comprises ~3,200km2 of tenure located ~180km west of Paraburdoo in WA. Paulsens consists of an operational 
underground mine, 450ktpa processing facility, 128-person camp and other related infrastructure. Gold production restarted 
in December 2024 and will move to full production during 2025. Paulsens has a regional Resource of 4.3Mt @ 4.0g/t Au for 
548koz and significant exploration and growth potential. 
Kal East: comprises ~650km2 of highly prospective ground to the east of the world class mining centre of Kalgoorlie, WA. 
Kal East contains a Resource of 18.8Mt @ 2.1g/t Au for 1,294koz, including a preliminary JORC 2012 Reserve of 3.7Mt 
@ 2.0 g/t Au for 243koz. A turn-key funding, development & processing arrangement to mine and mill the Myhree and 
Boundary open pit deposits is underway1. 
Black Cat entered into a binding agreement in February 2025 to purchase the Lakewood Processing Facility, ~6km east 
of Kalgoorlie. The processing facility, a conventional CIL gold circuit with current throughput of 1.2Mtpa, will commence 
processing Black Cat’s open pit and underground Ores during 2025. 
In addition to the significant regional exploration potential at Paulsens and Kal East, the Company also has two major 
organic growth projects at: 
Coyote: located in Northern Australia, ~20km on the WA side of the WA/NT border, on the Tanami Highway. Coyote has 
substantial built infrastructure including an airstrip, underground mine, 300ktpa processing facility, +180-person camp and 
other related infrastructure. The operation is currently on care and maintenance and has a Resource of 3.7Mt @ 5.5g/t Au 
for 645koz with numerous high-grade targets in the surrounding area. 
Mt Clement: is part of the Paulsens Gold Operation and is located 30km to the south of the operating gold processing 
plant.  Mt Clement is a polymetallic deposit and currently the 4th largest deposit in Australia of the critical mineral antimony.  
Significant upside potential for Resource growth and discovery of antimony, gold, silver and base metals exists at the 
project which will be aggressively explored in the coming years.
