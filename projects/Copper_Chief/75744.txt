# Fairchild Gold Corp. Announces Significant Expansion of Its Land Position at Its Historic Copper Chief High-Grade Copper and Gold Mining Camp in Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 23, 2024) - Fairchild Gold Corp. (TSXV: FAIR) ("Fairchild" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has increased the size of its Copper Chief Property by _**74%**_. The project area which encompasses a historic high-grade copper and gold mining camp, is easily accessible by paved road and is located 35 km Southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Through direct staking, the Company has acquired an additional 88 mineral claims, bringing the total project land package to 6.5 square miles _(approximately 16.6 square kilometers_).

This latest project expansion follows a recent property visit guided by ASTER satellite data analysis, which identified promising extensions of mineralization across the region with anomalies potentially related to granitic intrusions. These new claims significantly increase Fairchild's footprint in the historic Goodsprings mining district, known for its rich yet virtually un-explored copper, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and cobalt deposits.

"With this expansion, we are positioning ourselves for substantial exploration and development opportunities on our Copper Chief Property,"_  said _**Luis Martins**_ , CEO of Fairchild. _"The additional claims cover key geological targets, and we are excited about the prospect of unlocking significant value from this historic yet overlooked mining camp."_

Fieldwork has already begun, with outcrop and float samples collected from some of the newly acquired claims. These samples will be submitted to _Act Labs_ in Ontario, Canada, for comprehensive geochemical analysis. Meanwhile, reference materials from different lithologies are being assessed to understand their structural attributes, aiding Geologists in future exploration activities.

Fairchild continues to advance its exploration efforts, confident that this expanded claim package will enhance the potential for new copper and gold discoveries.
