# Fairchild Gold Acquires 72 Claims From Koba Resources Adjacent to Its Copper Chief Property at Goodsprings, Nevada

**VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA /[ACCESS Newswire](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) / February 11, 2025 / **Fairchild Gold Corp. (TSXV:FAIR) ("**Fairchild** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to purchase, subject to approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, 72 unpatented lode mining claims within and adjacent to **Fairchild's Copper Chief Property (** Cu-Au-Ag-PGEs-Co) located 35 km southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (Figure 1). These new claims add significant deposit potential for Porphyry copper-gold, Antimony, and Gold-silver-PGEs targets and deposits on the property.

Fairchild has made an agreement to purchase 72 mining claims from Koba Resources Ltd. (Australia) and Covada LLC (US:Nevada), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koba. To consummate the purchase transaction, Fairchild will issue and deliver to Koba 3,000,000 FAIR shares of common stock at a deemed price of CDN$0.05 per share and grant to Koba a One Percent (1 %) Net Smelter Returns Royalty, of which 50% of this royalty may be repurchased by Fairchild at any time for a cash consideration of CDN$1,000,000. This agreement is subject to acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.

**_Assets Acquired_** : The Koba claims contain several excellent mineral exploration targets that are additive to Fairchild's existing claims, including **the December Mine antimony-gold prospect, the Poppy Shaft gold system, and the Fitzhugh Lee, Rose, Mobile and Columbia Mine porphyry copper-gold targets**. Koba did a substantial amount of geochemical sampling and IP Geophysics, and Fairchild will be receiving this Koba database.

The Copper Chief Property is a good combination of a perfect geographic location, a 1-hour drive from Las Vegas, all the infrastructure in situ, with a geologically favorable environment; characterized by the existence of a set of multi-target, mainly Skarn-related mineralization, Carbonate Replacement Deposits with Porphyry-style potential, and multi-commodities like Cu-Au-Ag-PGEs.

Other critical metals, like antimony can be found on the property with **a 4500 g/ton sample found at the December Mine** in 2021. With this acquisition Fairchild Gold can now follow up on these and other findings without concern.

**_Copper Chief Targets_** : Fairchild is focused on the discovery of Porphyry Copper-gold systems (PCDs) and gold-silver-PGEs-antimony vein systems at Copper Chief. More than 15 old prospects and mines are located within the outline of the property. Several types and ages of mineral deposits are present. Fairchild's presently known targets are shown in _Figure 3._

**The #1priority target is the Copper Chief Porphyry** which has very high-grade copper mineralization present at the surface in multiple places, and in skarn that may indicate a shallower PCD system. Other ranked targets are:

**2025 Targets** :

**Sandy Veins Au-Ag-PGEs-Co**  
---  
**Ironside Fault hosted Au-Ag-PGEs-Sb (December/Knickenbocker Mines)**  
**Copperside and Skarn/PCD**  
**Rose Mine PCD**  
**Columbia Mine PCD-Co**  
**Whale Cobalt Target**  
**Cu /Au Tailings**  
  
***None of these targets have been previously drilled**
