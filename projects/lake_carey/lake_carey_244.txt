Matsa Resources Limited 
Matsa Resources Limited (“Matsa”, “Company”) is pleased to advise that it has executed a Tenement 
Option Agreement (“Agreement”) with global mining company AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited 
(“AngloGold Ashanti”). AngloGold Ashanti has the option to acquire the majority of Matsa’s Lake Carey 
Gold Project near Laverton Western Australia, for A$101M (at a gold price of A$4,500) (subject to the 
satisfaction of certain conditions precedent). 
Importantly, Matsa retains the near-term production Devon Pit Gold Mine (“Devon”), the Fortitude 
North Project and the Red October Accommodation Village, as well as associated tenements (Figure 
1). 
Matsa Executive Chairman Mr Paul Poli commented:  
“This transaction is the culmination of negotiations over the past 12 months with AngloGold Ashanti 
and I am thrilled with this outcome. To attribute a value of approximately A$101M to the Lake Carey 
Gold Project speaks volumes for the exploration potential of this project. Not only that, Matsa retains 
the highly valuable, near term production Devon project, Red October Accommodation Village and 
what I consider to be a very exciting exploration project in Fortitude North where recent drilling 
highlighted its potential. 
This transaction has been a long time in the making. I would like to thank AngloGold Ashanti and their 
team for the way in which the negotiations were conducted. To have a party of the ilk of AngloGold 
Ashanti speaks to the true potential value of Matsa’s assets and has attributed a ‘see through’ value of 
in excess of A$85 per resource ounce based on the current market gold price. 
I believe shareholders can now have a better understanding of the value of Matsa and what that now 
means for them and in to the future.  
Transaction Details 
AngloGold Ashanti will be granted an option (Option) to acquire the majority of the Lake Carey Gold 
Project. The Option may be exercised by AngloGold Ashanti at any time during the period that is 18 
months from the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (detailed below). 
Consideration 
The consideration payable by AngloGold Ashanti to Matsa under the terms of the Agreement is 
comprised purely of cash payments and is structured as follows: 
1. An Option Fee of A$8M, payable in the following instalments: 
(a) A$500,000 on execution of the Agreement (paid); 
(b) A$4,500,000 on the satisfaction of all conditions precedent; 
(c) A$1,500,000 on the date that is 6 months after completion of all conditions precedent and 
receipt of funds in (b) above; and 
(d) A$1,500,000 on the date that is 12 months after completion of all conditions precedent 
and receipt of funds in (b) above; 
Each instalment, once paid, is not refundable irrespective of whether the option is ultimately 
exercised. 
2. Option Exercise Fee – A$73M*  
The Option is able to be exercised within 18 months after satisfaction or waiver of the 
conditions precedent (see 1(b) above). If AngloGold Ashanti exercises the Option, the Option 
Exercise Fee is calculated based on the gold price at the time of exercise multiplied by 1.875% 
of the value of the agreed Resource of 936,000 oz. An amount of A$6M will be deducted from

Matsa Resources Limited 
this sum being a proportion of the Option Fee already paid in 1 above. An example of this 
formula in practice is outlined below: 
936,000oz x 1.875% xA$4,500 (gold price*) - A$6,000,000 – ROFR Value1 = A$72,975,000 
*gold price is the USD gold price (US$2,850)/USD-AUD exchange rate ($0.633) = $4,500 
1 ROFR Value refers to the value of any tenements whereby a party with a Right of First Refusal exercises that right 
to acquire the relevant tenement. For the purposes of this example, the ROFR has been assumed to be nil. 
3. Deferred Consideration - A$20M 
Following exercise of the Option in 2 above Matsa is entitled to receive further discovery 
royalties up to $20M from AngloGold Ashanti, for any JORC compliant resources discovered 
on the tenements included in the sale to AngloGold Ashanti calculated at 1% of the gold price 
at the date of the exercise of the Option in 2 above multiplied by the new resource ounces. 
There is no sunset date on this payment. 
In addition to the above, Matsa will be reimbursed for all tenement related expenses incurred and paid 
by Matsa, such as fees, rents, rates and other levies since 18 June 2024 up until the time the conditions 
precedent have been met under 1(b) above. 
Conditions Precedent 
There are several conditions precedent attached to this transaction which must be satisfied or waived 
for the option to be granted and the Option Fee instalments beyond the A$500,000 on execution to 
become payable (in the timing noted earlier). The key conditions are: 
1. Matsa obtaining all necessary approvals required by the Corporations Act, the ASX Listing Rules 
and its constitution to give effect to this transaction, including shareholder approval under 
Listing Rule 11.2. 
2. Matsa to obtain consent in writing from each of its lenders to enter the Agreement and for 
Matsa to not increase its indebtedness to the lenders. The lenders will also need to discharge 
their mortgages at the time the Option is exercised. 
3. There are a limited number of Right of First Refusals (ROFR’s) and third-party consents 
attached to specific tenements held by third parties for which Matsa must seek waiver of the 
ROFR’s or such consents from those parties. If the third parties choose to exercise their 
respective ROFR’s that third party must pay Matsa the attributable ROFR amount which would 
be deducted from the Option Exercise Fee payable by AngloGold Ashanti.  If a ROFR is exercised 
or required consent withheld, AngloGold Ashani can elect to exclude those tenements (such 
that the condition can still be satisfied) or terminate for the condition not being satisfied. 
There are a number of other conditions precedent that are common to an agreement of this nature, 
including assignment of any applicable royalties, which can be waived by AngloGold Ashanti should it 
choose to. 
The Company has engaged with the ASX who have confirmed that Listing Rule 11.2 does not apply to 
the transaction and accordingly shareholder approval will not be required. 
Other Key Points 
The other key features of the Agreement are as follows: 
1. Should all the conditions precedent not be met or waived within the stipulated timeframe, 
being 6 months from the date the Agreement was entered into, either party can withdraw 
from the Agreement.

2. Within 90 days of the condition’s precedent being met and receipt of the A$4.5M Option Fee 
instalment, AngloGold Ashanti can withdraw from acquiring specific tenements. This will not 
result in any adjustment to the Option Fee paid or Option Exercise Fee. 
3. AngloGold Ashanti may withdraw from the option completely at any time upon satisfaction or 
waiver of the conditions precedent up to expiry of the option period. Where it does so, any 
Option Fee installments that have been paid to Matsa prior to that withdrawal are non-
refundable. 
4. AngloGold Ashanti will be responsible to ensure all the tenements the subject of this 
Agreement are kept in good standing and they will have the right to conduct exploration on 
those tenements during the Option period. 
5. AngloGold Ashanti will have a first right of refusal over Fortitude North such that should Matsa 
enter in to any agreement to dispose of that project or project tenements AngloGold Ashanti 
has a right to match the sale value. 
6. Matsa retains ownership of the Red October camp and village and these assets are not the 
subject of the option granted under the Agreement. This infrastructure remains a key part of 
the development and mining of the Devon project. 
Matsa will now seek to meet all the conditions precedent relevant to it and do all things necessary to 
ensure it meets its obligations. 
Use of Consideration Funds 
Funds expected to be received from this transaction will be used to advance the Company’s remaining 
assets, being the near term production Devon Pit Gold Mine, further exploration at the Fortitude North 
project, corporate activities and working capital.
