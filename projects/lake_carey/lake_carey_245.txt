Matsa Resources Limited 
OVERVIEW 
Matsa Resources Limited (“Matsa” or “the Company” ASX: MAT) is pleased to announce that it has 
executed an extension to the Variation Agreement to Confidentiality Agreement (“Agreement”) with 
AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AGAA”) for an additional 45 days. The existing Agreement 
expired on 31 July 2024.  
On 31 July 2023, Matsa announced that it had entered into the Agreement with AGAA for a 12-month 
period which included an initial 3-month exclusivity period1. The exclusivity period expired on 31 
October 2023.  
Matsa and AGAA have had a longstanding, professional relationship and have had a number of 
meetings over the past 12 months to determine if there is a mutually beneficial outcome possible on 
the Lake Carey Gold Project excluding the Devon Pit Gold Project and Fortitude North. 
The parties feel it is worthwhile extending the Agreement for the next 45 days although it should be 
emphasised that there is no guarantee that a potential transaction will occur.
