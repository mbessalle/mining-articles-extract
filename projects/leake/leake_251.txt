E77/3152 prospective for copper and gold  
 
Highlights 
 
• MetalsGrove is pleased to advise that it has won the ballot for 
exploration tenement E77/3152, located approximately 135 km south 
of the Southern Cross township and gold province in Western Australia. 
• To be known as the Leake Prospect, the tenement, covering some 66.7 
km2 in area, is considered highly prospective for copper and gold. 
• Historical soil sampling identified a coherent copper anomaly situated 
on the northern portion of the tenement and open to the south. 
• A single line of aircore drilling has also been completed, with 
anomalous copper values also recorded. 
• The Great Southern Gold Mine, located approximately 2 km to the 
south-east along a granite-granite contact, extracted 1000t at 7.13g/t 
in the 1920s and 2053t at 5.72g/t during the 1980s. 
 
MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY 
Managing Director and CEO, Mr Lijun Yang, said:  
“In our 2 September 2024 announcement, I discussed the favourable 
environment for gold and copper as the basis for conducting the upcoming 
exploration program at the Company’s Bruce-Gold Copper Prospect in the 
Northern Territory. 
 
In that context, I am very pleased that we have been awarded tenement 
E77/3152 with its high prospectivity for copper and gold. 
 
The limited exploration effort conducted on the tenement to date, a modest 
soil sampling program and one line of aircore drilling, has demonstrated the 
presence of a coherent copper anomaly. 
 
My initial thinking is to undertake further soil sampling with a view to 
extending the copper anomaly to the south prior to a possible follow-up 
drilling campaign. 
 
The fact that the nearby area has been mined previously for gold and nickel 
all adds to the general prospectivity of the area.”

Multi-metal resources exploration company, MetalsGrove Mining Limited (ASX:MGA) 
(“MetalsGrove” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that, through a recent 
ballot, it has won the rights to ELA 77/3152,  a tenement prospective for copper and 
gold. 
The tenement, which is situated approximately 135 km south of the Southern Cross 
township and gold province and approximately 385 km east of Perth, comprises an 
area of approximately 66.7 km2 (refer Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1.  Map identifying location of Leake Prospect - tenement ELA 77/3152 – shown to the far right. 
The tenement is one of nine applied for in mid-2023 by the previous MetalsGrove 
management team in the broader Dundas/Leake area with the primary target being 
lithium. 
However, given the recent demise in the market for lithium, MetalsGrove has decided 
to relinquish eight of the tenements but proceed to grant the copper/ gold opportunity 
in ELA 77/3152. 
To reflect the change in focus from lithium to copper-gold, the opportunity will be 
known as the Leake Prospect (previously, the Dundas Prospect).  
The Leake Prospect is situated within a substantial tenement package prospective for 
gold, nickel and lithium held by Forrestania Resources Limited (ASX: FRS) (“Forrestania”). 
Forrestania’s Great Southern Gold Mine is located approximately two kilometers from 
the southernmost tip of ELA 77/3152 along a granite-granite contact tending onto 
E77/3152. 
The area has a rich mining history with approximately 1000t at 7.13g/t in the 1920s and 
2053t at 5.72g/t during the 1980s extracted. 
A map illustrating tenement ELA 77/3152 on local area geology, and its location with 
respect to Forrestania’s Great Southern Gold Mine, is set out in Figure 2.

Historic Exploration 
The lithology of tenement ELA 77/3152 is dominantly comprised of undivided granite, 
with a significant proportion (~25%) of greenstone and minor granitic gneiss.  
The tenement has had only limited exploration effort previously: 
• 
A single line of 21 aircore (AC) drill holes undertaken by Cassini Resources Limited 
in 2011 
• 
A soil sampling program undertaken by Marindi Metals Limited in 2018 
The aircore drilling line is located proximal to the copper anomaly (with details set out 
in Table 1). 
The majority of holes were drilled to blade refusal at a depth of approximately 15 metres 
with the deepest hole being 32 metres.  
The holes were assayed for gold in four-metre composites with the last meter also 
assayed for multi-elements, including copper.  
The highest gold assay recorded was 0.06 ppm. 
Copper values ranged from 15 – 297 ppm.  
No rock chip sampling has been conducted on the tenement itself.  
However, rock chips assayed from meta-komatiite samples within greenstone located 
some one to three kilometres to the west were anomalous for gold and silver. 
The soil sampling program was completed along a series of east-west lines of between 
0.8 to 1.5 km in length and at a nominal spacing of 200 m. Samples were collected from 
a depth of 10 to 20cm, with 250 to 300 g (sieved through a -1.6 sieve) of material sent 
to ALS for four acid ICP ME-MS61 multi element analysis (Table 2).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                            
 
The soil samples demonstrated the presence of a coherent copper anomaly in the 
northern part of ELA 77/3152.   
Multiple copper results of more than 30 ppm were recorded, with a maximum value of 
140 ppm (Table 2). 
Anomalous copper is observed on three soil lines and remains open to the south.   
A map illustrating soil sample and drill hole collar locations, and assay results derived 
therefrom, on location area geology is set out as Figure 3.

Next Steps 
In due course, MetalsGrove intends to undertake a further soil sampling program at the 
Leake Prospect: 
• 
To the south of the copper anomaly to define and determine optimal drill 
locations for testing 
 
• 
To test the granite-granite contact along strike of Forrestania’s Great Southern 
Gold mine.

Appendix 1:  JORC Code, 2012 Edition - Table 1 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or 
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate 
to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, 
or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be 
taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity 
and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems 
used. 
• Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be 
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m 
samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for 
fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) 
may warrant disclosure of detailed information. 
• Drilling was conducted on the Forrestania, WA. Drilling was supervised 
and samples collected by geologists from Cassini Resources Ltd.  
Drilling comprised twenty-one (21) air core (AC) holes. Samples were 
collected as 4m composites (1-2kg in size) and submitted to ALS 
Minerals in Perth for 30g Fire Assay.  Bottom of hole 1m samples were 
also collected and submitted for ICP-AES 33 multi element analysis. 
• Soil samples were taken at depths of 10-20 cm and a weight of 250-
300 g. They were sieved on site to -1.6 mm except for wet samples 
which were bulk sampled and returned to camp for drying and 
processing. 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air 
blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diametre, triple or 
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, 
whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). 
• The drilling was conducted by Drillwise Pty Ltd, with an aircore rig. 
Holes were drilled to blade refusal with the deepest hole penetrating to 
32m. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries 
and results assessed. 
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure 
representative nature of the samples. 
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and 
whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain 
of fine/coarse material. 
• Sample recovery and sample condition was not recorded in the historic 
information.  No relationship between recovery and grade is known.   
Logging 
• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and 
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral 
Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. 
• AC drill holes were logged for various geological attributes, including 
colour, lithology, texture, grain size, weathering, and alteration.  Only 
brief descriptions were recorded in the logs.  Logging is only qualitative 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                              Page 2 of 7

• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or 
costean, channel, etc) photography. 
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 
in nature. The entire drill hole from top to bottom was logged. 
• Soil samples the field data was recorded at each sample site including 
slope, presence of float, lag or calcrete and any other relevant 
observations such as proximity to old drill holes and diggings. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. 
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether 
sampled wet or dry. 
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the 
sample preparation technique. 
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to 
maximise representivity of samples. 
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in 
situ material collected, including for instance results for field 
duplicate/second-half sampling. 
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material 
being sampled. 
• The drill samples were collected at 1 m scoop samples from the bottom 
of holes. The composite samples were collected as approximately 1 to 
2 kg sub-sample using a scoop. The sample sizes and analysis-size 
are considered appropriate to correctly represent the mineralization 
based on the style of mineralization, sampling methodology and assay 
value ranges for the commodities of interest. 
• No historic information on the Quality Control used on the aircore 
drilling.  It was noted that QAQC samples were used but details on the 
procedures is unknown. 
• Samples were submitted to ALS Minerals Lab, Perth for analysis. 
• The soil samples were taken at depths of 10-20 cm and a weight of 
250-300 g. They were sieved on site to -1.6 mm except for wet 
samples which were bulk sampled and returned to camp for drying and 
processing.  This sample collection is considerer appropriate. 
Quality of 
assay data and 
laboratory tests 
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory 
procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or 
total. 
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, 
the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument 
make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their 
derivation, etc. 
• Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, 
duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels 
of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. 
• 108 composite samples were analysed at ALS for Au via 30g fire assay 
only. 
• The assay method and laboratory procedures were appropriate for this 
style of mineralisation. 
• Bottom of hole samples were also submitted to ALS for 33 element 
four acid digest with ICP-AES finish to assist with identification of 
pathfinder minerals and lithology. 
• Laboratory procedures are within industry standards and are 
appropriate for the commodities of interest. 
• Soil sample analysis was undertaken at ALS laboratories Malaga, 
Perth. The protocol used was a 4-acid digest ICP ME-MS61 for 48 
elements and a separate Au-TL43 25 g aqua regia for gold.  Field 
duplicate samples were noted to be collected but the frequency of 
these duplicates was not recorded.

• Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the 
degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral 
Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications 
applied. 
• Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
• Distance of the drilling holes distance was 50-200m spacing at the

possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering 
the deposit type. 
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of 
key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling 
bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. 
• Drill holes were drilled vertical.  The drill line was completed 
perpendicular to the interpreted mafic greenstone.  
• Twenty-one holes are located an exploration line where is striking to 
southwest to northeast. 
 
Sample security 
• The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
• The sample security was not record for the drilling or the soils but it is 
assumed that the samples being collected used pre-numbered calico 
bags and loaded into polyweaves bags for transport to the lab.  It is 
assumed that the samples were dropped of by company personnel. 
• The sample submission was submitted by email to the lab, where the 
sample counts and numbers were checked by laboratory staff.

agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, 
partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, 
wilderness or national park and environmental settings. 
• The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any

• Ownership – 100% MetalsGrove Mining Ltd 
Exploration 
done by other 
parties 
• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. 
• All historical work referenced in this report has been undertaken by 
previous project explorers. Whilst it could be expected that work and 
reporting practices were of an adequate standard, this cannot be 
confirmed.  The main operators were Marinda Metals that conducted 
the soil sampling and then Cassini Resources Ltd that completed the 
drilling. 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. 
• The Forrestania greenstone belt forms part of the Southern Cross 
Domain in the central Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia (Cassidy et al., 
2006). The Archaean greenstones comprise a lower association of 
tholeiitic basalt, up to six ultramafic units, and thin, banded iron-
formation and chert units (Frost et al., 1998). This succession is overlain 
by an upper association of pelitic to psammitic schists (meta-
sedimentary rocks). The greenstones form a regional north-plunging 
syncline, which has been intruded by granites and pegmatite dykes. 
During the Proterozoic, dolerite dykes were emplaced into east-west 
fractures. 
• The Forrestania Project area extends east from the eastern flank of the 
currently recognised limits of the Forrestania greenstone belt. The 
topography is relatively uniform except within the extreme southern and 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                              Page 5 of 7

south-western portions where moderate hills provide some variation in 
relief.  
• The geology of the Project has been further interpreted by Southern 
Geoscience Consultants (SGC) from recently released public domain 
geophysical data. The tenement is coincident with a positive gravity 
anomaly that reflects a lobe of greenstones, semi-contiguous with the 
main greenstone belt. The existence of this lobe appears to have 
escaped the attention of most previous explorers but has become clear 
with the recent release of regional gravity data for the southern part of 
the Southern Cross Domain. There is little expression of the 
greenstones in the aeromagnetic data but aeromagnetic data highlight 
circular to elliptical granite plutons in the north and southwest parts of 
the Project.  
• The Forrestania Shear Zone is shown as bifurcating near the southern 
boundary of the tenement, and a western arm of the Shear Zone is 
interpreted to traverse the western part of the tenement. This 
interpretation is based on the reduced gravity signal, which can be 
explained as resulting from hydrothermal alteration of greenstones (+ 
granite gneiss). SGC interpret this western arm as an embayment of 
granite gneiss without the implication of a shear zone. However, the 
interpretation of the geophysical data that strain related to the 
Forrestania Shear Zone is partitioned around a central block of thick 
greenstones corresponding to a distinct gravity high is also considered 
equally legitimate. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the 
exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for 
all Material drill holes: 
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in 
metres) of the drill hole collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o down hole length and interception depth 
o hole length. 
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the 
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the 
understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly 
explain why this is the case. 
• A table of anomalous copper soil samples have been included in the 
press release along with the collar locations of the aircore drilling.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade 
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for 
such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such 
aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values 
should be clearly stated. 
• No reporting of drill intersections have been reported in the press 
release. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralization 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle 
is known, its nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
• It is too early in exploration activities to understand the orientation of 
any potential mineralisation as such there is no relationship between 
orientation of drilling and mineralisation known at this point in time. 
 
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of 
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill 
hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• An appropriate exploration map and cross section has been included in 
the release. See maps in the body of the report. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not 
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades 
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• All exploration data and results conducted by Metals Grove to date 
have been reported 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported 
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical 
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential 
deleterious or contaminating substances. 
• Nothing to report. 
 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral 
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, 
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, 
provided this information is not commercially sensitive. 
• Soil sampling to designed to continue existing soils to the south to 
define the existing surface anomaly extents.  Possibly AC drilling upon 
the receival of the above mentioned soil sampling.
