(\"First American\"; CSE: URM) and its 60%-owned subsidiary, FirstAmerican Energy Fuels Ltd. (the \"Optionor\"), pursuant to which Myriad has the option (the \"Option\") to earn a 100% interest in and to the First American Red Basin Uranium Project (the \"Project\" or the \"Red Basin Project\"), comprised of 86 lode claims in the Red Basin area of the Datil Mountains - Pietown Uranium District, Catron County, New Mexico, USA covering approximately 1,776 acres (approximately 719 hectares). As more fully detailed below, consideration is comprised of cash and share payments aggregating C$525,000 which will be made immediately. The option becomes fully exercised once Myriad performs a geophysical survey at the Project within the next 12 months.    </p><p>Myriad's CEO Thomas Lamb commented: \"<i>We believe the acquisition of Red Basin is a significant coup for the Company, resembling in some ways the Copper Mountain transaction, where we quickly unlocked enormous value.

The drilling confirmed that the Red Basin Project contains high-grade uranium-vanadium mineralisation of 0.17% - 0.31% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8 </sub>that is near surface.

I note there is also exciting potential along the structures adjacent to the Project, which we are investigating.  We anticipate that drilling in the Red Basin will be relatively easy and inexpensive, given the nature of the rock and the fact that mineralization is near the surface. We believe this acquisition positions us very well in the broader Datil Mountains - Pietown Uranium District.  Together with our neighbour, there is excellent potential to get to a high-grade and near-surface resource of 40 Mlbs in the Datil Mountains - Pietown Uranium District relatively quickly and inexpensively.\"</i></p><p>The Company's lead consulting geologist, George Van der Walt, stated <i>\"According to the New Mexico Bureau of Mines, 'Unleached roll-front deposits should be preserved in the down-dip projection of the paleosol where it lies below the present water table', which could open up new potential from ISR extraction in a relatively underexploited and underexplored district.

To date, Myriad has earned a 50% interest in Copper Mountain. Copper Mountain hosts several known uranium deposits and historical uranium mines, including the Arrowhead Mine which produced 500,000 lbs of eU3O8. Copper Mountain saw extensive drilling and development by Union Pacific during the late 1970s including the development of a mine plan to fuel a planned fleet of California Edison reactors. Operations ceased in 1980 before mining could commence due to falling uranium prices. Approximately 2,000 boreholes have been drilled at Copper Mountain and the Project Area has significant exploration upside. Union Pacific is estimated to have spent C$117 million (2024 dollars) exploring and developing Copper Mountain, generating significant historical resource estimates which are detailed <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/q8ZMzUng0a\">here</a>.  Myriad recently concluded a 34-hole maiden drill program in November 2024 which encountered significant high grade uranium mineralisation that exceeded expectations, provided verification of historical exploration work, and encountered mineralisation in deeper zones, which opens exciting new potential for the Copper Mountain Uranium Project.

Historical estimates of 1.5 - 6.5 million pounds U 3 O 8 (inferred), as estimated by Rio Grande Resources Corporation in 2012 (not NI 43-101 compliant). The mineralisation is in thick sections of roll-front deposits hosted in permeable sandstones from surface to depths of less than 450 feet. The shallow roll front mineralization suggests there may be numerous extraction options that could be economic.
