# Green Bridge Metals Corporation Options World Class Copper-Nickel Exploration Portfolio in Duluth Complex Minnesota

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / February 6, 2024 /** **Green Bridge Metals Corporation (CNSX:GRBM)** ("**Green Bridge** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that it has entered a letter of intent (the "LOI") with Encampment Minerals Inc., dated February 5, 2024 whereby the Company has an option to earn an 80% interest in the 8,460-hectare (84.6 square kilometre (km)) South Contact Zone Project, targeting copper (Cu), nickel (Ni)-platinum group element (PGE) mineralization. The project area is located approximately 65 km north of the city of Duluth, Minnesota (Figure 1).

The South Contact Zone (SCZ) project is located along the southern basal contact of the Duluth Complex (Complex) which hosts several world-class Cu-Ni deposits. The SCZ is located immediately south of the Mesabi Range iron ore district. It is estimated that the northwestern margin of the Complex contains 4.4 billion tons of sulfide mineralization grading 0.66% Cu and 0.20% Ni1. The Complex is part of the Midcontinent Rift System, a region characterized by mafic and ultramafic hosted Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization, including multi-million-ton deposits such as Eagle (4.1 million tonnes @ 2.9% Cu, 3.6% Ni)2, Tamarack (8.5 million tonnes @ 0.9% Cu, 1.7% Ni3, and Mesaba (2.2 billion tonnes 0.4% Cu, 0.1% Ni, 0.5 ppm PGE)4 (Figure 1). In addition, the SCZ is a prime locality for Oxide Ultramafic Intrusions (OUI) which host high-grade iron (Fe) -titanium (Ti) - vanadium (V) deposits that commonly contain significant disseminated Cu-Ni sulfide mineralization (Figure 2) and are associated high grade Cu-Ni targets. Green Bridge is optioning the project from Encampment Minerals Inc., (EMI) a privately owned U.S. corporation.

**SCZ Project Highlights:**

  * Located in the Duluth Complex, host to world class copper - nickel deposits.
  * Four separate projects with known copper-nickel and/or titanium-vanadium-copper mineralization
  * Historical drilling and geophysical surveys provide clear drill ready targets across the underexplored portfolio.
  * Plans to initiate drill program within first year of the agreement.



**A Message from David Suda, CEO of Green Bridge Metals**

"Green Bridge is focused on creating shareholder value by bringing forward exploration and development opportunities to supply critical and strategic minerals to the rapidly growing green economies and power grids of North America and the world beyond. We are pleased to have secured a rare portfolio of assets with clear mineralization in an underexplored world class region within the Duluth Complex of Minnesota. We plan to advance these underexplored properties by leveraging historical exploration data by drilling in the coming 12 months. We would like to thank EMI for the opportunity to advance upon the fine work they have completed to date."

The SCZ project is comprised of multiple properties; Siphon-Wyman, Skibo, Titac, Boulder Creek, and Boulder Lake North, all with previously identified Cu-Ni-PGE, or Ti-V mineralized bodies through historical drilling (Figure 3). Most properties in the SCZ are early stage and have had limited historical exploration, however, EMI completed a VTEM (Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic) airborne geophysical survey from which numerous undrilled conductors have been interpreted across several of the properties. In addition to recent VTEM, historical airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys (AEM) provide detailed geophysical data across the whole region. These geophysical surveys provide useful targeting data for exploration by the Company. Several properties, including the highly prospective Skibo area, are drill-ready with the Company expected to begin drilling within the first year of the agreement.

The SCZ project is host to multiple styles of mineralization:

  * Disseminated Cu-Ni sulfide mineralization at the Siphon-Wyman property is similar to that at the Maturi and Mesaba deposits.
  * High-grade magmatic Cu-Ni mineralization at Skibo is generally similar to mineralization at the Tamarack deposit.
  * Ti-V-Cu mineralization associated with oxidized ultramafic intrusions (OUI) at the Titac area with a NI 43-101 inferred resource of 45.1 million tonnes at 15% TiO25.



Within the SCZ project area are a number of untested OUIs. Previous exploration suggests a spatial and genetic relationship between OUI and magmatic massive Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization. With a mix of mineralization styles spanning multiple properties, the SCZ holds significant potential for mineral resources deemed as critical by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2022. Importantly, the SCZ project is located to the south and outside of the Boundary Waters Wilderness area and watershed and no access or permitting issues of consequence have been experienced to date.

**Siphon-Wyman (Disseminated Cu-Ni) Target:**

This property spans approximately 1,360 hectares with historical drilling identifying disseminated Cu-Ni mineralization at Wyman Creek (Wyman Creek resource) and structurally controlled massive sulfide mineralization within the associated Siphon Fault Zone (Figure 4, Table 1). The property lies along the basal contact of the Partridge River Intrusion. A number of untested high-priority geophysical electromagnetic conductors have been detected within the fault zone and Wyman Creek resource area

**Skibo Property (Massive and Disseminated Cu-Ni):**

Skibo comprises 3,108 hectares and is characterized by a magnetic anomaly striking over 3.5 km north to south along with multiple, untested, geophysical electromagnetic conductors within the property associated with OUIs and providing drill-ready targets (Figure 5). Skibo OUIs are host to significant disseminated Cu-Ni mineralization that has not been assayed systematically for either Ti or V (Figure 6). Two important footwall high Cu-Ni-PGE grade massive sulfide vein stockwork zones have been identified that are related to the OUIs. These zones are considered high-priority targets. Massive sulfide veins in the northern stockwork zone (DDH-SK09-2) is shown in Figure 7. Table 2 below provides a summary of the historical intercepts.

**Titac- Boulder- Boulder North Properties (TiO 2 \- V2O5, Disseminated Cu-Ni):**

Several properties lie along the southern portion of the SCZ project: Titac, Boulder, and Boulder North (Figure 8) comprising approximately 3,992 hectares. Titac has the most advanced exploration with a NI 43-101, inferred resource of 45.1 million tonnes averaging 15% TiO25. This resource correlates directly with a discrete magnetic anomaly and has excellent potential to grow to the north where there is a second similar magnetic anomaly with historical drilling demonstrating Ti-V mineralization (Figure 8). A similar magnetic anomaly is present to the southeast of Titac that has not yet been drilled. In addition, the TiO2 mineralization at Titac contains significant disseminated Cu mineralization with the historical drill results assaying for copper presented below in Table 3. Importantly, there are three prominent electromagnetic conductors that are considered highly prospective for high-grade Cu-Ni mineralization that have not been drill tested.

The Boulder/Boulder North properties have limited drill testing but contain numerous magnetic anomalies and conductors that are proposed for drilling (Figure 9). Importantly, the Boulder properties have both Ti-V and Cu-Ni exploration potential based on limited historical drilling and geophysics. This area is considered highly prospective and will be the focus of an updated VTEM survey by the Company as historical airborne surveys are from the 1960's.

The above mineralization estimates are not current and should be considered "historical estimates" under National Instrument 43-101 -Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101"). A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource or reserve, and the Company is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves. The Company would need to conduct an exploration program (including drilling) in order to verify these historical estimates as current in accordance with NI 43-101. There can be no certainty, following further evaluation and/or exploration work, that these historical estimates can be upgraded or verified as mineral resources or mineral reserves in accordance with NI 43-101. As such, these historical estimates should not be relied upon.
