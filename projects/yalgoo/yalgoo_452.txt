Divestment of WA Lithium Rights 
Key Points 
• 
Spartan Resources to acquire the lithium rights over the Yalgoo, Egerton and 
Dalgaranga Projects for cash consideration of $275,000. 
• 
Transaction streamlines Firetail’s portfolio consistent with its core focus on 
advancing its cornerstone Skyline Copper Project in Canada.  
• 
Discussions continuing with interested parties in relation to the sale of its remaining 
non-core Australian mineral assets. 
Firetail Resources Limited (Firetail or the Company) (ASX: FTL) is pleased to advise that it has 
entered into a binding agreement with Spartan Resources Ltd (Spartan) (ASX: SPR) enabling 
Spartan to re-acquire the lithium rights over certain tenements at the Yalgoo, Egerton and 
Dalgaranga Projects for a cash consideration of $275,000. 
The sale is consistent with Firetail’s previously announced strategic focus on advancing its 
cornerstone Skyline Copper Project in Newfoundland, Canada while crystallising value from its 
non-core Australian asset portfolio (see ASX announcement, 12 December 2024). The recent 
inclusion of the Picha Project, Peru in the BHP Xplor 2025 program also provides equity free 
funding of up to US$500k for accelerated exploration activities (see ASX announcement, 6th 
January 2025). 
For Spartan, the acquisition is consistent with its strategy of consolidating the mineral rights 
across its core gold projects, thereby reducing unnecessary administrative costs.  
Firetail continues to evaluate opportunities to monetise the balance of its Australian portfolio, 
which includes Paterson Copper-Gold-Uranium Project and the Mt Slopeaway Nickel-Cobalt 
Project. 
Managing Director, Glenn Poole commented: 
“As outlined in recent announcements, our strategic focus is on actively advancing exploration at 
the Skyline Copper Project in Newfoundland, and the Picha Project, Peru with the BHP Xplor 
 
2 
team, where we see substantial potential to generate value for our shareholders through 
exploration and discovery success.   
“We are pleased to have ﬁnalised this transaction with Spartan Resources to crystallise value 
from the ﬁrst of our non-core WA assets, the lithium rights over the Yalgoo, Egerton and 
Dalgaranga Projects.  
“As well as realising $275,000 in cash, which will strengthen our funding position, this is a ﬁrst 
step towards streamlining and simplifying our portfolio and positioning the Company for long-
term growth. 
“We have prepared data rooms for the Paterson Copper-Gold-Uranium Project and Mt Slopeaway 
Nickel-Cobalt Projects and discussions are progressing with interested parties.”  
 
This announcement has been authorised for release to the ASX by the Company's Board of 
Directors.

About Firetail Resources 
Firetail Resources (ASX: FTL) is an Australian-based copper exploration company currently 
focused on its ﬂagship Skyline Copper Project located in Newfoundland, Canada and generative 
exploration at Picha Project in Peru.  
The Skyline Copper Project is an advanced high-grade Copper-Zinc-Silver VMS Project in 
Newfoundland, Canada, host to historic production of 100,000 tonnes mined at 3-12% Cu, 7% 
Zn and 1-3oz/t Ag (refer to Firetail’s ASX announcement dated 6 June 2024). The project area 
covers 110km2 with a 25km strike of highly prospective lithology and contact zones currently 
being targeted by high impact drilling and high resolution geophysics. 
Firetail also has exposure to over 280km2 of greenﬁeld high-grade copper potential through its 
70% holding in the Picha Copper-Silver Project (222 km2) and Charaque Copper Project (60 km2) 
in Southern Peru. The Picha and Charaque Projects are hosted within the Tertiary volcanic belt 
and is also in the NW extension of the Tucari and Santa Rosa high sulﬁdation systems and in the 
SE extension of the skarn-porphyry belt that hosts the Tintaya district. The area is prospective for 
epithermal, stratabound, carbonate replacement (CRD) and porphyry related styles of copper 
 
3 
mineralization. Picha is a very lightly explored copper-silver project where Firetail is generating 
multiple drill-ready targets and is part of the BHP Xplor Program for 2025, Picha Project will 
beneﬁt from a one-off, non-dilutive grant of up to US$500,000, and Firetail will receive in-kind 
services, mentorship, and networking opportunities with BHP and other industry experts and 
investors. The Peru Projects are held through the Peruvian entity Kiwanda S.A.C (70% ASX:FTL 
/30% ASX:THB). 
The Company currently has active exploration programs across the Skyline Project, including 
processing of recently completed airborne EM survey, modelling of mineralisation intersected in 
recent drilling and analysis of drilling results. In Peru the in-country exploration team is 
conducting ground-based mapping and soil sampling to deﬁne existing and additional high 
potential copper targets.
