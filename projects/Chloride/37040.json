It covers the northwestern extension of the Tennessee Mine, one of the two principal mines in the district. Initial grab sampling by Silver Range returned analyses up to <strong>18.75 g/t Au</strong>, <strong>764 g/t Ag</strong>, 11.6% Zn and 2.35% Pb from dump material at the Elkhart, Dardanelles and Argyll Mines. These small past producers are found along a 1500 m long structural extension of the Tennessee Mine vein system. At Chloride, a total of 27 samples were collected, 4 of which returned assays greater than 5 g/t Au. Silver Range intends to conduct detailed geological mapping, grid soil sampling and geophysical surveys to identify targets for subsequent trenching and drill testing.</p><p><i>Crosby Property</i></p><p>The Crosby Property is located 67 km west of Prescott in Yavapai County. The property covers the small past producing Crosby Mine, an underground mining operation which saw intermittent production from 1906 to 1931. Known historical development on the property includes a 107 m inclined shaft and systematic development along strike for 100 m to a depth of 50 m. A 10-stamp mill was operated on the property prior to 1931. Preliminary sampling by Silver Range returned dump and chip samples assaying up to <strong>22.8 g/t Au</strong> with 5 of 27 samples returning assays greater than 5 g/t Au. Silver Range intends to conduct geochemical and geophysical surveys on the property to locate drill &amp; trenching targets.</p><p><i>South Kitikmeot Gold Property drill results</i></p><p>Silver Range optioned the South Kitikmeot Gold Property (\"SKGP\") to Viridis Mining &amp; Minerals Limited (\"Varidis\") in October 2021 (<a href=\"https://pr.report/tO0iE19M\"><i>Silver Range News Release dated August 19, 2021</i></a>).

The seven properties comprising the SKGP cover the known significant gold occurrences between the Lupin Gold Mine at Contwoyto Lake and the Goose Lake Project, currently under development by B2 Gold Corp.</p><p><i>Option activity</i></p><p>On May 26, Silver Range concluded two amendments to letters of intent (\"LOIs\") signed with Green Gold LLC (\"Green Gold\") granting Green Gold options on the East Goldfield and Tule Canyon Properties (<a href=\"https://pr.report/Fpb7ydMC\"><i>Silver Range News Release dated April 28, 2023</i></a>).

At the laboratory, samples were crushed to progressively to &lt; 2 mm (ALS Code CR-32) and a 1 kg aliquot was pulverized to 85% passing a 75 mm mesh (Code PUL-32). A 50 g subsample was then fire assayed with an atomic absorption finish (Code Au-AA26). In addition, induced coupled plasma analysis for 35 elements was performed on the samples (Code ME-ICP41). Overlimit silver analyses were re-analyzed using a gravimetric method (Code Ag-OG46).
