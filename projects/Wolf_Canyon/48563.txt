(CSE: NCLR) (CNSX: NCLR.CN)**("**Basin Uranium** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce it has acquired the Wolf Canyon Uranium Project (the "**Project** " or "**Wolf Canyon** ") located in Fall River County, South Dakota, USA.

**Wolf Canyon Project, South Dakota**

The Wolf Canyon Uranium Project is comprised of 1,600 acres of contiguous claims (80 unpatented mineral lode claims) located 10 miles east of Edgemont, South Dakota. Access to the property is facilitated through US Highway 18, located two miles to the west, with year-round gravel and ATV roads servicing the claims. The Wolf Canyon project lies within the northeast trending Long Mountain structural zone with uranium mineralization hosted in the Inyan Kara sedimentary group. The uranium deposits of southwest South Dakota are roll-front style typically found in paleo-fluvial channels similar to those found in Wyoming and other productive districts. Exploration on Wolf Canyon dates back to the 1970's with several large companies having drilled numerous wells on the property. Specifically, resource drilling by Union Carbide Corp. in the 1970's reported uranium mineralization significant enough to commission an internal resource, however additional verification and validation must be performed by the Company's Qualified Person before being disclosed publicly.
