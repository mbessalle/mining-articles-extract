ACQUISITION OF HIGH-GRADE COPPER 
PROJECT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. 
 
HIGHLIGHTS  
 
Copper mineralisation at Ilgarari is hosted in steeply dipping NE-trending structures, 
with historic drilling defining mineralisation over a strike distance of more than 4 km, 
including historic high-grade drill results.   
 
Historic deeper drilling has returned high-grade copper intersections, including: 
 17m @ 1.27% Cu from 145 m (RC12IL140) 
 Inc. 7m @ 2.04% Cu from 147 m  
 17.1m @ 1.20% Cu from 251m (RC12IL175) 
 Inc. 4m @ 3.42% Cu from 251 m 
 12m @ 1.57% Cu from 158 m (RC12IL151) 
 Inc. 2m @ 6.62% Cu from 158 m  
 3m @ 3.26% Cu from 139 m (RC12IL122) 
 2m @ 2.45% Cu from 343.7 m (RC12IL175) 
 1m @ 3.61% Cu from 457.5 m (DD14IL014) 
 
IP survey and geophysical review highlighted multiple drill targets including a broad 
chargeability conductor which splays off the main mineralised fault zone.   
 
Regionally significant magnetic feature has been modelled directly under the known 
mineralisation and is yet to be drill tested. 
 
Earn-in agreement to acquire up to an 80% interest in all rights to minerals at the 
Ilgarari Copper Project located below 120m from the natural surface.  
 
Additional tenement applications submitted to expand the footprint over regional 
scale structures. 
 
Commenting on the agreement, CEO Andrew Taylor said: “This acquisition represents 
a unique opportunity to secure a joint venture in a highly prospective copper project in a tier 
one jurisdiction.  Prior exploration has defined mineralisation over 4 km along the Ilgarari 
Fault and with numerous high-grade hits around both the “Main” and “Alac” workings.  The 
Lord team looks forward to undertaking a systematic exploration program for the extensions 
and source of this mineralisation in conjunction with Blackrock Resources. 
“The acquisition presents a low-cost entry into a highly prospective copper project for Lord.”

Lord Resources Limited (ASX: LRD) (“Lord” or the “Company”) is pleased to report the 
Company, via its wholly owned subsidiary, Tailflower Pty Ltd (‘Tailflower’), has entered into 
a binding earn-in agreement (‘Agreement’) with Blackrock Resources Pty Ltd (‘Blackrock’) 
to earn up to an 80% interest in the Sulphide Rights within exploration licence E52/2274 
(‘Tenement’), which hosts the high-grade Ilgarari Copper workings (Fig. 1), in Western 
Australia.   
The Tenement is located 110km south of Newman, off the Great Northern Highway in 
Western Australia.

Copper mineralisation at Ilgarari is hosted within the steeply dipping NE-trending Ilgarari 
Fault which crosscuts flat lying siltstones, shales and dolerites sills and dykes. The dolerite 
sills and dykes have been attributed to a major continental tholeiitic magmatic event within 
the Collier basin of the Bangemall Supergroup.  
Previous drilling was generally to a depth of less than 100 metres and mainly intersected 
secondary copper mineralisation of malachite, azurite and chrysocolla where a deep 
weathering profile is proximal to the fault zone. Deeper drilling has shown that 
mineralisation persists into fresh sulphide ore (Fig. 2-3), although no systematic exploration 
has been undertaken at depth.

Exploration activity has largely focused on two areas of oxide mineralisation being the 
“Main” and “Alac” zones (Fig. 4). Only 11 holes were drilled deep enough to intercept the 
Ilgarari fault beneath the 120mRL threshold, with 10 of these hitting mineralisation (see 
Table 1). 
The depth extensions to Main and Alac zones will be the initial focus of exploration 
activities, with the Company intending to undertake detailed analysis of mineralisation, 
alteration, petrophysics and geophysics of these defined zones to form an exploration 
framework that can be applied across the wider project.

INDUCED POLARISATION SURVEY 
An Induced Polarisation survey (IP survey) was completed in 2012.  This survey highlighted 
chargeability anomalies within splays off the main Ilgarari Fault zone, assigned the name 
“Target 8”. 
As this survey was only modelled to a depth of 100m, Lord has had this data remodelled 
by a geophysical consultant (see Figure 5) who has extended the model down to a depth 
of 225m and defined several chargeability anomalies, particularly as splays off the Ilgarari 
Fault zone.

AEROMAGNETIC SURVEY 
An aeromagnetic survey flown in 2010 was completed on a line spacing of 100m and was 
reprocessed to produce a magnetic inversion model by Lord’s consulting geophysicist.  
 
The results of this processing were highly encouraging, with modelling showing a 
regionally significant magnetic anomaly of approximately 270nT, starting at 350m from 
surface.  
 
The centre of this anomaly is between the surface expressions of the “Main” and “Alac” 
oxide zones (see Figure 6) and extends north to the interpreted down-dip intersection point 
of the two lodes at Alac (Figure 7).  
 
There is a notable single-station ground gravity anomaly that coincides with this magnetic 
anomaly.  The ground gravity coverage was collected on a regional 2.5km station spacing, 
Lord intends to undertake a close-spaced ground gravity survey to further refine this target.  
 
These geophysical characteristics could indicate a concealed hydrothermal system at 
depth and be the potential source of the near-surface mineralisation at Ilgarari.

TENEMENT APPLICATIONS 
In addition to the Ilgarari Copper Project Agreement on E52/2274, Lord has also lodged 
two tenement applications for exploration licences E52/4403 and E52/4405, to the 
northeast of the Ilgarari copper workings.  
Both these applications have numerous geochemical targets defined along repetitions of 
the same northeast structures which host the Ilgarari copper workings. RAB drilling to blade 
refusal was undertaken in 2010 to test the base metal potential of structures interpreted 
from aeromagnetic images, with sampling taken as bottom of hole single metre samples, 
and wide composites throughout the hole. Encouragingly, one of these holes, ILR241, 
returned 10m @ 0.12% Cu in a 10-metre composite sample from 55-65m, and has yet to be 
followed up.

Lord’s priority after entering the Agreement with Blackrock is to explore for high-grade 
mineralisation or feeder structures at depth, which have deposited the copper occurrence 
near surface. Extensions to mineralisation beneath the “Alac” zone (see Figure 9) will be the 
near-term priority drill targets, in addition to testing IP targets. 
 
The knowledge gained from understanding the nature and controls on mineralisation at 
“Alac” will then be applied across the broader project including the north-east extensions 
of the Ilgarari Fault zone, where a single drillhole DD14IL014 was drilled under EIS funding 
2,500m north of the “Alac” Zone, and returned:

TRANSACTION TERMS 
The Company, via its wholly owned subsidiary Tailflower Pty Ltd, has entered into a binding 
earn-in agreement with Blackrock Resources Pty Ltd, pursuant to which Blackrock has 
agreed to grant Tailflower the exclusive right to earn up to an 80% legal and beneficial 
interest in the Sulphide Rights (defined below) within the Tenement (‘Acquisition’). 
The Sulphide Rights means all rights to minerals the subject of the Tenement located below 
120m (Relative Level) from the natural surface.  
For the avoidance of doubt, Blackrock is only interested in the Oxide Rights, being all rights 
to minerals the subject of the Tenement located above 120m (Relative Level) from the 
natural surface.  
Conditions 
Completion of the Acquisition, is subject to and conditional upon the satisfaction (or waiver) 
of the following conditions precedent (‘Conditions’): 
(i) 
completion of due diligence in relation to the Sulphide Rights, to the satisfaction 
of the Company in its absolute discretion, and notifying Blackrock of such 
satisfaction, on or before 31 January 2025; 
(ii) 
the Company obtaining all necessary shareholder approvals for the Acquisition, 
including approval for the issue of the Consideration Shares (if required);  
(iii) 
Blackrock becoming the legal and beneficial owner of the Tenement; and 
(iv) 
the Company and Blackrock receiving all other necessary regulatory, 
governmental and third-party approvals or consents that are necessary to 
realise completion under the Agreement. 
Consideration 
In consideration for the Acquisition, the Company, on behalf of Tailflower, will pay/issue to 
Blackrock the following consideration: 
(i) 
a cash payment of $25,000 (exclusive of GST) upon execution of the Agreement;  
(ii) 
a cash payment of $75,000 (exclusive of GST) upon completion of the 
Acquisition; and 
(iii) 
the issue of $100,000 (exclusive of GST) worth of fully paid ordinary shares in 
the capital of Lord (‘Shares’), with the number of Shares determined by 
reference to the volume weighted average price of Shares for the 30-trading 
day period ending on the business day before the completion date 
(‘Consideration Shares’). 
Earn-In and Joint Venture 
On and from completion of the Acquisition (‘Completion Date’), Tailflower has the right to 
acquire an 80% legal and beneficial interest in the Sulphide Rights (‘Earn-in Interest’) by 
funding $1,500,000 of expenditure in respect of the Sulphide Rights within 4 years from the 
Completion Date (‘Earn-in Period’), including expenditure of at least $500,000 within the 
first 24 months of the Earn-in Period.  
On and from the Completion Date, where Blackrock proposes to sell, transfer or assign any 
of its interest in the Oxide Rights and/or the Tenement to a third party, Lord will be granted 
the pre-emptive right over the Oxide Rights and/or interest in the Tenement. 
 
 
 
 
 
ASX:LRD LRDO

11
If Tailflower earns the Earn-in Interest within the Earn-in Period, Tailflower and Blackrock 
will form an unincorporated joint venture in respect of the Sulphide Rights (‘JV’) with the 
participating interests in the JV being, 80% (Tailflower) and 20% (Blackrock). Blackrock will 
be free carried by Tailflower in relation to its 20% interest in the JV until a decision to mine 
(‘Free Carried Period’). Taiflower will be granted pre-emptive rights over Blackrock’s 20% 
JV interest.  
If Blackrock elects not to contribute to JV expenditure after the Free Carried Period in 
proportion to its JV interest, Lord will granted the irrevocable right to acquire Blackrock’s 
20% JV interest at a fair market value. 
The Company notes that the Tenement is subject to a royalty to be paid to a former owner 
of the Tenement, consisting of: 
(i) 
$50 per tonne of copper metals produced up to a total of 20,000 tonnes of 
copper metal and a 1% NSR above 20,000 tonnes of copper; and 
(ii) 
a 1% net royalty on all metals produced other than copper.

SECTION 1 SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND DATA 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)

Commentary
Sampling 
techniques 
 
Nature and quality of sampling 
(eg cut channels, random 
chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard 
measurement tools 
appropriate to the minerals 
under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, 
etc). These examples should 
not be taken as limiting the 
broad meaning of sampling. 
 
Include reference to measures 
taken to ensure sample 
representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems 
used. 
 
Aspects of the determination 
of mineralisation that are 
Material to the Public Report. 
 
In cases where ‘industry 
standard’ work has been done 
this would be relatively simple 
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling 
was used to obtain 1 m 
samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other 
cases more explanation may 
be required, such as where 
there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (eg 
submarine nodules) may 
warrant disclosure of detailed 
information. 
 
The Ilgarari Copper Project has had variable amounts of 
drilling, with most drilling targeting the oxide mineralisation 
within 120m from surface, which is not part of this acquisition.

DRILLING 
 
The AC & RC drilling by GME Resources Ltd in 2016 is between 
180m and 2615m northeast of the Alac copper workings, 
targeting the interpreted Ilgarari Fault.  Samples were 
collected via cyclone at 1m intervals.  A 4m composite sub-
sample was submitted to the laboratory for analysis. 
 
Four diamond drillholes were completed by Kumarina 
Resources Pty Ltd in 2014, in conjunction with the EIS.  All 
holes had RC pre-collars.  The sampling was based on 
geological observations and anomalous results from pXRF.  
Half-core was collected from selected intervals, and sent to a 
laboratory for chemical analysis. 
 
The RC drilling completed by Kumarina Resources Pty Ltd in 
2012 and 2014 collected samples at 1m intervals via a cyclone 
then passed through a riffle splitter.  All samples were scanned 
using a hand-held pXRF instrument.  Samples the recorded 
values of >0.1% copper were collected and sent for acid digest 
followed by AAS or OES analysis. 
 
There has been no data submitted to DEMIRS for any drilling 
on E52/2274 before 2012.  The vendors have supplied a drill 
database, but the records cannot be verified or validated.  
There is no detailed information available about drilling 
methods and conditions, or sampling methodology and 
analysis.

Until the late 1960s no coordinated exploration had been carried out on the 
Project.  Several mine workings were developed along the shear and were 
worked intermittently until 1973, by Conwest (Aust) NL and Group Copper 
Limited.  WAMEX report A80276 reports historic production of 1,908 tonnes 
grading 30.76% Cu and 1,253 tonnes grading at 16.19% Cu.  The Main 
Working (western) and the Alac Working (eastern) were mined via a series of 
shafts between and 1968 and 1973, which reached a maximum depth of 14m. 
 
Numerous shallow drilling campaigns have been completed at the Ilgarari 
Copper Project prior to 2012, however no detailed information is available 
 
Historic exploration has been focused on expanding the oxide resource, 
rather than defining the source of the copper. A Mineral Resource Estimate 
(JORC 2004) was reported by Kumarina Resources Ltd in 2012 indicated 
1.1Mt @ 1.9% Cu for 20,941 tonnes of copper.  This inferred resource was 
only extended to 150m depth, and is not part of the deal between Lord & 
BlackRock.

 
The Ilgarari Copper Project lies within the Mesoproterozoic Bangemall Basin, 
which comprises a thick sequence of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary 
rocks. The Bangemall Basin consists of the older basal Edmund Group that is 
unconformably overlain by the Collier group.  The project area lies within 
Collier Group sediments, which has been intruded by the dolerite (+/- 
gabbro) sills and dykes of the Kulkatharra Group – part of the underlying 
Warakuna Large Igneous Province.  These basic dyke and sills range in 
thickness between 1m and 100m.

Commentary
 
On a project scale, the Ilgarari workings are situated on an alluvium covered 
plain with sparse mulga vegetation. The few outcrops in the area consist of 
quartz and ironstone caps which follow a line of mineralisation in a zone up to 
50m wide over a length of 2,000m.  
 
Copper mineralisation occurs in east-northeast striking and steeply south 
dipping faults and shears and is commonly developed at or near dolerite-
shale contacts.  The area is attributed to supergene enrichment of sulphide-
quartz occurring as fault or fissure fillings.  The near surface and historically 
worked mineralisation is represented as limonite veinlets up to 10m wide 
containing copper carbonates (malachite and azurite) and the silicate 
chrysocolla and the oxide cuprite.  With increasing depth, the oxide minerals 
are replaced by chalcopyrite and chalcocite and rare native copper.  
 
At surface, secondary copper-oxide mineralisation is confined to a steep-to-
moderately dipping mylonitic shear zone, within the Ilgarari Fault.
