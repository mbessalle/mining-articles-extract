Marda Gold Acquisition Progresses 
Towards Completion 
Leeuwin Prepares for Maiden Drilling program at Marda Gold Project in 
WA Targets identified and drilling contractor engaged 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Leeuwin Metals Ltd (ASX: LM1) (“Leeuwin” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise it is rapidly 
progressing plans for Phase One Exploration program at the Marda Gold project in WA’s Eastern 
Goldfields. Leeuwin is undertaking an extensive review process and finalising drilling 
arrangements to enable work to commence as soon as practicable following shareholder 
approval of the Marda acquisition.     
The Company released the Notice of Meeting last week (see ASX release dated February 14, 
2025). The meeting will take place on March 17, 2025. Once Leeuwin has secured shareholder 
approval of the Resolutions concerning the Marda acquisition, it intends to start mobilising 
drilling crews and equipment as soon as possible. 
Since announcing the agreement to acquire Marda (see ASX release dated December 20, 
2024), Leeuwin is undertaking an extensive data review and target generation program. 
It is now using the results to devise a phased drilling program, with 10,000m’s budgeted for 2025. 
This will be funded from the proceeds of the recent $3.25 million share placement (see ASX 
release dated January 28, 2025).  
The Marda Gold Project spans over 500km² of granted mining, exploration, and prospecting 
leases, situated 120km north of Southern Cross. The project hosts 8 open pits and numerous 
historical workings, with significant exploration potential highlighted by multiple high-priority 
targets requiring immediate follow-up work.  Leeuwin will prioritise the vast under-explored 
high-grade potential across the project which remain open and require immediate follow-up 
drilling.

Executive Chairman, Christopher Piggott, commented: 
“We have secured an outstanding opportunity with the acquisition of Marda, and we are ready 
to hit the ground running. We have hired a senior geologist and engaged a drilling contractor. 
In addition, we have submitted a Program of Work and applied for additional tenure 
surrounding the existing Marda leases. 
We believe Marda has significant exploration potential, and our work so far supports this view. 
We look forward to commencing the upcoming drilling program.” 
 
Marda Gold Project 
Overview 
The Marda Gold Project represents an advanced gold asset with significant exploration upside 
and near-term development potential. Leeuwin Metals aims to leverage its strategic location, 
extensive tenement package which consists of mining, exploration, and prospecting leases, and 
is proximal to existing infrastructure to unlock long-term shareholder value.

Marda Priority Targets 
There are multiple targets within the project area, with the project broken into 4 main areas, 
Marda Central, Marda North, Marda South and Marda West. Targets represent various stages of 
exploration maturity from resource definition around existing open pits, historical workings, 
geochemical anomalies, and untested concepts. This will enable Leeuwin to develop multiple 
work programs for 2025 to advance exploration within the project with an initial focus on more 
advanced target areas. The following exploration results referenced in this announcement were 
previously disclosed in the ASX announcement dated 20 December 2024.

exploration as at 20 December 2024. Historical production figures from Marda are sourced from Ramelius Resources' Annual 
Report released on 18 October 2024. 
Marda Central 
Marda Central is host to 4 existing pits that Ramelius mined.  Extensions to these pits remain a 
high priority target area, foot wall and hanging wall target areas will also be a priority for drilling 
in 2025. Multiple significant drill intercepts that remain include: 
• 
1m @ 15.84g/t Au from 47m (MRC248) - Taipan 
• 
1m @ 27.75g/t Au from 31m (MAR111) - Taipan 
• 
1m @ 42.1g/t Au from 53m (MAR108) - Cobra 
• 
5m @ 8.23g/t Au from 23m (MAR182) - Cobra 
• 
14m @ 4.03g/t Au from 79m (DURC016) - Dugite 
• 
28m @ 1.52g/t Au from 28m (MRC146) - Marda 4 
• 
18m @ 1.68g/t Au from 13m (MRC241) - Marda 4 
• 
4m @ 14.05g/t from 25m (MRB075) - Gold Stream

Marda North 
Multiple prospects within the Marda North region are compelling targets.  The Evanston Mine 
area has seen little modern exploration since production ceased in 2000 and is a high priority 
for exploration in 2025. Mineralisation remains open in all directions within the 1.3km trend, and 
more broadly within the 4.5km of strike.   
Significant results from the Evanston Mine area include: 
• 
2m @ 16.75g/t Au from 12m (NRC043) – Evanston Mine 
• 
3.6m @16.4g/t Au from 1m (EDM003) – Evanston Mine 
• 
8m @ 5.76 g/t Au from 8m (ERC147) – Evanston Mine 
Additional Marda North project targets, include the high priority prospects of Mt King, Die Hardy 
(existing open pit) and Red Leg’s require follow up with significant results of: 
• 
7m @ 2.32g/t Au from 97 (FBRC0128) - Die Hardy 
• 
5m @ 7.47g/t Au from 120m (MKC003) - Mt King  
• 
4m @ 7.27g/t Au from 70m (MKC006) - Mt King 
• 
3m @ 22.36g/t Au from 18m (MB1532) - Red Legs 
• 
1m @ 9.68g/t Au from 40m (MB1557) - Red Legs 
Marda South 
Exploration targets with the Golden Orb trend to test the extension of the mine sequence BIF.  
Mineralisation is open beneath the existing pit as well as the Golden Orb West target that 
extends from the existing pit.  The trend has been mapped over 3km to date with significant 
results for follow up: 
• 
2m @ 13.13g/t Au from 91m (GOC035) - Golden Orb West 
• 
1m @ 15.3g/t Au from 4m (GORC004) - Golden Orb 
• 
2m @ 9.09g/t Au from 31m (GORC0097) - Golden Orb 
Marda West 
Work at Marda West has focused on the existing King Brown pit.  Multiple high grade drill 
intersections demonstrate the depth potential of the prospect as well as the significant target 
area at the footwall target of King Brown West.  Limited drilling has occurred along strike of these 
prospects with significant results from this area being: 
• 
2m @ 8.8g/t Au from 110m (KBR021) – King Brown 
• 
1m @ 26.8g/t Au from 136m (KBR028) – King Brown 
• 
12m @ 1.78g/t Au from 12m (MAB1159) – King Brown North 
• 
8m @ 4.31g/t Au from 12m (MAB0725) – King Brown South

Marda Geology 
The Marda Gold project stretches 70km between the Evanston goldmining area in the north to 
Golden Orb in the south.  Gold was first discovered in 1901 with intermittent mining since.  Gold 
mineralisation is hosted in Youanmi Terrane in the Marda-Diemals Greenstone Belt and locally 
associated with banded iron formations (BIF’s) and quartz veining associated with sulphides.  
Ramelius completed mining across several open pits with a total production of 2.3mt @ 1.9g/t 
Au (143koz)1 between 2019 and 2023.  Historical production estimates for the Evanston Mine 
totalled approximately 40koz with the most recent mining occurring from 1998 to 2000 at 
Evanston.

Next steps 
Leeuwin will hold the shareholder meeting on 17 March 2025 to seek approval for the Marda 
acquisition and the issuance of consideration shares to Ramelius Resources. Following 
approval, the Company will proceed with completion of the acquisition, subject to the 
satisfaction of all conditions precedent by 31 March 2025. Once the acquisition is finalised, 
Leeuwin will immediately commence mobilisation of drilling crews and equipment to begin its 
planned 2025 exploration program. The initial focus will be on high-priority drill targets, 
including extensions of previously mined pits and untested anomalies identified through 
historical data analysis.  
The Company remains well-funded for these activities, having undertaken a $3.25 million two-
tranche placement announced on 28 January 2025. Completion of Tranche Two remains 
subject to shareholder approval, which will be sought at the 17 March 2025 meeting.
