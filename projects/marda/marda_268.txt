Leeuwin Agrees to Acquire Marda Gold Project in 
Western Australia from Ramelius Resources 
Marda Hosts extensive known mineralisation and numerous well 
defined exploration targets 
 
 
HIGHLIGHT 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•
Leeuwin Metals has signed a binding share sale agreement to acquire 100% of Marda Operations 
Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ramelius Resources Limited (ASX: RMS). Marda Operations 
owns 100% of the Marda Gold Project, located in the highly prospective Western Australian 
goldfields. 
•
The project includes multiple existing pits on granted mining leases and offers exceptional 
exploration upside, with high-grade drill intercepts and underexplored historical prospects 
providing a clear path to potential resources. 
•
The acquisition represents significant value for Leeuwin shareholders, with an upfront 
consideration of $500,000 in Leeuwin shares to be issued to Ramelius upon completion. 
Additional milestone payments, payable in cash, include: 
o
Milestone 1: $500,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 500koz. 
o
Milestone 2: $1,000,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 1Moz. 
•
The project spans over 500km2 of mining, exploration, and prospecting leases, prospective for 
both gold and iron ore, and is strategically located 120km north of Southern Cross. 
•
While historical exploration at Marda has largely focused on near-mine areas and existing open 
pits, Leeuwin will prioritise the vast underexplored high-grade potential across the project which 
remain open and require immediate follow-up drilling.  
•
Leeuwin’s strategy will focus on defining extensions to high-grade zones across key prospects, 
supported by historical un-mined intercepts such as: 
o
2m @ 16.75g/t Au from 12m (NRC043) - Evanston 
o
3.6m @ 16.4g/t Au from 1m (EDM003) - Evanston 
o
8m @ 5.76 g/t Au from 8m (ERC147) - Evanston 
o
5m @ 7.47g/t Au from 120m (MKC003) - Mt King 
o
4m @ 7.27g/t Au from 70m (MKC006) - Mt King 
o
1m @ 15.84g/t Au from 47m (MRC248) - Taipan 
o
1m @ 27.75g/t Au from 31m (MAR111) - Taipan 
•
Ramelius will become a strategic shareholder in Leeuwin at completion, reinforcing alignment 
and positioning both companies for potential future collaborative growth opportunities.

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT | 20 December 2024 
  
2 
Leeuwin Metals Ltd (ASX: LM1) (“Leeuwin” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce it has 
entered into a binding share sale agreement with Ramelius Resources Limited (ASX: RMS) 
(“Ramelius”) to acquire 100% of Marda Operations Pty Ltd (“Marda Operations”) (“the 
Acquisition”). Marda Operations owns the highly prospective Marda Gold Project (“Marda” or 
“the Project”), located in the renowned Western Australian Goldfields. 
The Marda Gold Project spans over 500km² of granted mining, exploration, and prospecting 
leases, situated 120km north of Southern Cross. The project hosts 8 open pits and numerous 
historical workings, with significant exploration potential highlighted by multiple high-priority 
targets requiring immediate follow-up work. 
Executive Chairman, Christopher Piggott, commented: 
“The acquisition of the Marda Gold Project is a pivotal step for Leeuwin Metals, delivering significant value with 
minimal dilution to shareholders. This advanced gold project in Western Australia provides an exciting growth 
platform with substantial exploration potential. 
Marda hosts extensive known mineralization in and around existing pits. This mineralization is open and represents 
low hanging fruit for our initial exploration campaign. There are also numerous drilling targets which have been 
defined by geophysics and limited drilling. There is immense upside at these targets which we will prioritise as part 
of our resource growth strategy. The project’s strategic location, within trucking distance of multiple gold mills and 
supported by excellent infrastructure, further enhances its viability. 
With granted mining leases included in the acquisition, Leeuwin is well-positioned to rapidly progress discoveries 
into development. We are excited to commence work programs and look forward to sharing updates as we advance 
this opportunity into 2025.” 
 
Marda Gold Project 
Strategic Rational 
Marda Gold provides Leeuwin Metals with a transformative opportunity to establish a strong 
foothold in the world-class Western Australian Goldfields region. 
• Proven Mining History: The project features established open pits on granted mining leases 
and significant drill intercepts, providing a solid foundation for near-term exploration and 
growth.  
• Immediate Work Programs: With granted mining leases already in place, Leeuwin can 
commence work immediately, prioritising follow-up on multiple high-priority targets. 
• Strategic Location: Situated close to critical infrastructure and processing hubs, the project 
minimises lead times to production within the Western Australian Goldfields. 
• Portfolio Diversification: Marda complements Leeuwin's existing portfolio of critical metals 
by introducing exposure to gold, a globally valued commodity, in a highly prospective and 
mining-friendly jurisdiction. 
While primarily focused on gold, the Project is also prospective for iron ore, offering additional 
optionality for future exploration.

Marda Priority Targets 
There is multiple targets within the project area, with the project broken into 4 main areas, 
Marda Central, Marda North, Marda South and Marda West.  Targets represent various stages 
of exploration maturity from resource definition around existing open pits, historical workings, 
geochemical anomalies and untested concepts.  This will enable Leeuwin to develop multiple 
work programs for 2025 to advance exploration within the project with an initial focus on more 
advance target areas.

Marda Geology 
The Marda Gold project stretches 70km between the Evanston goldmining area in the north to 
Golden Orb in the south.  Gold was first discovered in 1901 with intermittent mining since.  Gold 
mineralisation is hosted in Youanmi Terrane in the Marda-Diemals Greenstone Belt and locally 
associated with banded iron formations (BIF’s) and quartz veining associated with sulphides.  
Ramelius completed mining across several open pits with a total production of 2.3mt @ 1.9g/t 
Au (143koz)1 between 2019 and 2023.  Historical production estimates for the Evanston Mine 
totalled approximately 40koz with the most recent mining occurring from 1998 to 2000 at 
Evanston.

Section 1: Sampling techniques and data 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g., cut 
channels, 
random 
chips, 
or 
specific 
specialised 
industry 
standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals 
under 
investigation, 
such 
as 
downhole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF 
instruments, etc.). These examples should 
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning 
of sampling. 
Sampling was completed using a combination of Reverse Circulation (RC) 
and Diamond Drilling (DD). RC drill samples were collected at 1m intervals in 
a cyclone at the side of the drilling rig and a sub-sample collected via a riffle 
or cone splitter.  The remaining portion was laid out on the ground for logging. 
Occasional wet samples were not split but collected in a plastic bag then 
spear sampled. Some samples were collected as 2m or 4m composites. 
Diamond Drilling (DD) core was sampled as 1m or geologically selected 
intervals. Core was sawn to provide half core samples for analysis. Core 
outside lode or mineralised zones is not always sampled. 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure 
sample 
representivity 
and 
the 
appropriate 
calibration 
of

measurement tools or systems used. 
All sampling by conventional gold industry drilling methods. 
Aspects 
of 
the 
determination 
of 
mineralisation that are Material to the Public 
Report. In cases where ‘industry standard’ 
work has been done this would be relatively 
simple (e.g., ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg 
was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for 
fire assay’). In other cases, more explanation 
may be required, such as where there is 
coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. 
Unusual 
commodities 
or 
mineralisation 
types 
(e.g., 
submarine 
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed 
information. 
Sampling Technique details for historic drilling are often partial or unknown.  
Early RC drilling may have been collected in bagged 1m samples and 
manually riffle split. 
Drilling 
techniques 
Drill type (e.g., core, reverse circulation, 
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g., core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of 
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc.). 
Numerous holes drilled by Gondwana (1990's) and Southern Cross Gold 
(2011) as mostly RC drilling, plus moderate DD holes. RMS drilled additional 
RC infill holes between 2019-2023 which confirmed earlier drillholes. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
Core recovery has been logged for more recent drilling (post 2019) and is 
generally excellent (≈100%). Minor wet intervals occur and can affect RC 
sample recovery. Chip sample recovery is generally not logged but noted if 
wet sample or other issues (rare). Voids relating to historic UG workings are 
logged as open or filled stope voids. 
Measures 
taken 
to 
maximise 
sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature 
of the samples. 
Sample recovery at all deposits is generally excellent in weathered and fresh 
rocks. Recent drilling has utilised RC rigs of sufficient size and air capacity to 
maximise recovery and provide dry chip samples or using significant 
diamond drilling, RC primary, duplicate and total sample was weighed and 
graphed at the rig to check sample recovery and interval accuracy. 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential 
loss/gain 
of 
fine/coarse 
material. 
No indication of sample bias is evident or has been established. 
Logging 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
level of detail to support appropriate Mineral 
Resource estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies. 
Recent drilling (+2019) has been logged for lithology, oxidation, alteration, 
veining, textures and sulphides and all core is photographed and unsampled 
core retained. Chip-trays are retained for RC precollars and holes. Older 
drilling generally has a minimum of lithology is logged for +90% of holes, with 
varying degrees of other information.

Recent core holes are sawn and sampled as half core. Some 1/4 core 
sampling has occurred as checks. Older drilling details incomplete but where 
available were similar. 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, 
rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet or

investigated 
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling 
is representative of the in-situ material 
collected, including for instance results for 
field duplicate/second-half sampling. 
All recent samples sub-sampled using accepted splitting techniques and 
have been delivered to laboratory for total preparation by crushing and 
pulverisation, before being sub-sampled for analysis.

sampling 
achieves unbiased sampling of possible 
structures and the extent to which this is 
known, considering the deposit type. 
The core drilling and RC drilling is completed orthogonal to the interpreted 
strike of the deposits. A number of scissor holes exist at most deposits. Marda 
ore zones are generally vertical. 
If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to have 
introduced a sampling bias, this should be 
assessed and reported if material. 
No bias considered present for all project areas. Minor potential for 
orientation bias for some individual holes exists, but no bias is believed 
evident at broader scales 
Sample 
security 
The measures taken to ensure sample 
security. 
All recent (+2019) samples have been collected by Ramelius geological staff. 
Samples are transported to the laboratory by commercial transport 
companies. The laboratory receipts received samples against the sample 
dispatch documents and issues a reconciliation report for every sample 
batch.

+/- quartz. Deep weathering has likely generated supergene 
enhancement of gold at shallow to moderate depths.

If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drillhole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (e.g., 
‘downhole length, true width not known’). 
The majority of the drill holes are drilled as close to orthogonal to the 
plane of the mineralised lodes as possible. A number of drill holes have 
intersected the mineralisation at high angles. 
Only down hole lengths are reported.
