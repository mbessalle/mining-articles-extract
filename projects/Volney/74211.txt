# Lion Rock Acquires High-Grade Gold-Lithium Volney Project in South Dakota

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 9, 2024) - Lion Rock Resources Inc. **(TSXV: ROAR) (FSE: KGB)**(the "**Company** " or "**Lion Rock** ") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement dated October 7, 2024 (the "**Option Agreement** ") with Tinton Partners and The Tinton Land, LLC (together, the "**Optionor** "), pursuant to which the Optionor has granted to the Company the exclusive right and option (the "**Option** ") to acquire an undivided 100% interest in the Volney property (the "**Volney Project** "), a high-grade gold-lithium project, strategically located in the northern Black Hills of South Dakota (**Figure 1**) (the "**Transaction** "). The Volney Project is comprised of 38 private claims extending over 351 acres (142 ha) and features two predominant styles of mineralization: shear-hosted gold and Lithium-Tantalum-Tin within the pegmatites. The Volney Project hosts the Giant Volney Pegmatite (Li) and numerous historic workings including Rusty Mine (Au), Rough and Ready (Sn) and Hydliff Adit (Au) shown in **Figure 2**. Historic results include **18.2 g/t Au over 18.3 m** in channel sampling at Rough and Ready and 15 grab samples with an average grade of **4.4% Li****2****O** at the Giant Volney pegmatite (**Table 1**).

Dale Ginn, President and CEO of Lion Rock, stated, "_The Volney Project is unique in that it contains multiple commodities including gold, lithium, tantalum and tin, all of which are of a high-grade nature and near surface. The gold system runs the full length of the property and contains numerous shallow trenches, pits and other workings, but is remarkably absent of any meaningful drilling or recent exploration work. The fact that the entire project lies on private land and is road accessible year-round, decreases permitting time and allows for a timely and aggressive exploration program."_

**Acquisition Highlights**

  * **The Volney Project.** The Volney Project is 142 ha in the Tinton District of the Black Hills. The Tinton District was the second-most productive alluvial goldfield in the Black Hills. Adjacent and parallel to the Giant Volney pegmatite is a 3.5 km long shear zone, host to multiple occurrences of gold mineralization and historic workings. Gold mineralization in at least three different settings including sheared/altered amphibolite, broadly mineralized basalt and iron formation. Historic pegmatites on the Volney Project comprise of seven discrete pegmatite bodies ranging from 10 to 23 m wide, converging to the south to form a >120 m wide lithium-rich pegmatite, the Giant Volney, over a known strike length of 635 m at surface (**Figure 2**)1. 


  * **Historic High-Grade Gold Mineralization:** The Volney Project contains an extensive shear hosted gold system, bordering the western extents of the Giant Volney. The shear zone is within an amphibolite schist derived from an archean basalt, measuring 73m wide and tested over a strike length of 3.5km. Historical workings at the Rusty Mine had reported intersections of **5 g/t** -**15 g/t Au over 15-45 m** in the main altered amphibolite zone2. Petrography of the core from Homestake Mining reveal the dominant sulphide minerals as pyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. Arsenopyrite is concentrated along the margins of the quartz veins, which contains abundant magnetite inclusions making it highly magnetic. The mineralized quartz veins were observed to have native gold grains as fracture filling and between the arsenopyrite grains3



**Drilling:** In 1975, Homestake Mining Company drilled at the historic Rusty Shaft, intercepting gold mineralization in eight shallow holes. HMC-3 highlights **36.6 m at 1.52 g/t Au** including four higher grade sections starting at surface to the end of the hole (**Figure 4**). All holes were no deeper than 50 m below surface. 

  * **Historic High Grade LCT Pegmatite at Giant Volney.**
    * 15 grab samples collected by Nellis (1973) from the exposed quartz- spodumene orebody at the extreme southern end of the Giant Volney averaged a grade of **4.4% Li****2****O**(**Table 1**)1. 
    * 31 mini-bulk sample sites ranging from 45-900 kg averaged a grade of **2.4% Li****2****O****1**. 
    * Only two holes tested the down-dip extent of mineralization. None of the known pegmatites have been drilled below a depth of 30 m. 
    * Drill hole DDH VN-25 (1967) graded 19.56 m at **2.01 wt% Li****2****O** beginning at a depth of 6.73 meters, including two higher-grade intervals separated by a barren pegmatite screen of 8.83 m at **2.30 wt% Li****2****O** and 5.66 m at **2.83 wt% Li****2****O** (Figure 3)1. 



**Volney Project History**

Gold was discovered and mined in alluvial drainage below the Volney Project in the late 1800's. Rusty Mine, Hydliff and Giant development and workings followed. The Rough and Ready Mine was primarily a Tin producer, however extensive drifting and development for gold was undertaken in the adjacent sheared amphibolite unit. The Giant Volney Mine consists of both surface and underground workings with high grade concentrates of Lithium and Tantalum produced in the 1940's. Limited and sporadic exploration for gold and lithium occurred in the 1960's and 1970's, and no significant exploration has taken place since.
