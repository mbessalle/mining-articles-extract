ADVANCED HIGH-GRADE ANTIMONY
& SILVER PROJECT AQUISITION
Lode Resources Ltd (ASX:LDR) (“Lode”, or the “Company”) is pleased to announce it has
signed a heads of agreement to acquire 100% of the Montezuma Antimony Project located
in Tasmanian’s premier West Coast Mining Province. This project includes a high-grade
antimony-silver-lead deposit with initial development, advanced metallurgy, significant
mining equipment and beneficiation infrastructure.
Highlights
• High-grade Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit defined by surface channel
sampling, exploration adit face sampling and diamond drill core sampling.
➢ Surface grab samples grade up to 24.5% antimony (Sb) & 3,050 g/t
silver (Ag)
➢ Diamond drill core samples grade up to 20.3% antimony (Sb) & 1,990 g/t
silver (Ag)
➢ Development face samples grade up to 21.4% antimony (Sb) & 2,478 g/t
silver (Ag)
• Development of portal box cut and commencement of exploration drive has
produced stockpiled mineralisation. Representative bulk sampling of combined
mineralisation/waste averaged 4.75% antimony (Sb) & 239 g/t silver (Ag) and
representative bulk sampling of mineralisation only, averaged 9.02% antimony (Sb)
& 769 g/t silver (Ag) reconciling well with corresponding face sampling.
• Metallurgical test work is well advanced with 90% recoveries of antimony achieved
producing a saleable antimony product.
• R&D funding discussions are ongoing with local and international institutions
including those representing major western governments.
• Montezuma Antimony Project acquisition complements Lode’s antimony exploration
portfolio in the New England Fold Belt, NSW’s most prolific antimony province.
Together, these assets create a formidable Antimony division within Lode.
• Also compliments Lode's high-grade Silver portfolio with assays due shortly from
the Webbs Consol Silver project where drilling at the Castlereagh prospect has been
completed.
• Montezuma Antimony Project acquisition terms include:
➢ $50,000 non-refundable cash deposit payable within 2 business of execution of the HOA ie 22
October 2024; plus
➢ $200,000 cash payable on completion of the Proposed Acquisition; plus
➢ 10,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares in the Company at a deemed issue price of $0.10 per
share on completion of the Proposed Acquisition subject to 12-month escrow; plus
➢ Up to 6,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares in the Company at a deemed issue price of $0.10
per share upon satisfaction of certain performance hurdles by the Sellers (key terms are
outlined in Annexure 1) and subject to 12-month escrow.
➢ The fully paid ordinary shares will be issued under listing rule 7.1 using the Company's
existing capacity.

Montezuma Antimony Project Deposit
The Montezuma Antimony Project deposit (2M-2023, EL7-2019) is located between well-known
mining centres such as Rosebery (Zn,Cu,Pb), Renison Bell (Sn), Henty (Au) and Zeehan(Pb,Ag).
Access is via the Zeehan township located 14km to the west.
Figure 5. Montezuma Antimony Project located in Tasmanian’s premier West Coast Mining Province
The Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit is a structurally controlled lode, emplaced primarily
within the well-known Motezuma fault and hosted by a sequence of turbidites. Antimony and lead
are contained within Jamesonite, a lead-iron-antimony sulphide mineral (Pb FeSb S ) and is a
4 6 14
late-stage hydrothermal mineral forming at moderate to low temperatures. This project is also
prospective for copper, zinc and gold.
The Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit is defined by surface sampling of the exposed
mineralised structure over 50m strike length, development face sampling and 13 diamond drill holes
which have intercepted high-grade mineralisation down to a depth of 80m. The Montezuma
antimony-silver-lead deposit remains open to the north, south and at depth.
Cautionary Statement: All Eploration Results from the Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit are considered to be
“historical”, not reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 and a Competent Person has not done sufficient work
to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance with the JORC Code 2012. It is possible that following further evaluation
and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior reported Exploration Results may be reduced when reported
under the JORC Code 2012. Nothing has come to the attention of the acquirer that causes it to question the accuracy or
reliability of the former owner’s Exploration Results. Lode has not independently validated the former owner’s Exploration
Results and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results. Nevertheless, these
exploration results are considered to be material to the acquisition and thus price sensitive. Please refer to Annexure 2
JORC 2012 Table 1 of this announcement for descriptions of sampling methods used. Lode plans to review all exploration
sampling to date during the due diligence period under the heads of agreement so as to determine what remedial actions
are needed to bring exploration results up to JORC standards. Such actions may include resampling of drill core,
surveying drill collars, etc, in addition to further exploration work.

Montezuma Antimony Project Surface Sampling
Surface grab samples have been taken from trenches perpendicular to strike and at 5m intervals
along a 50m exposure of the Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit. With reference also to the
cautionary statement above, surface samples have graded up to 24.5% antimony (Sb), 3,050
g/t silver (Ag) and 39.1% lead (Pb).
These surface sample antimony grades ranged from 4.36% to 24.50%, silver (Ag) grades ranged
from 124 g/t to 3,050 g/t and lead (Pb) grades ranged from 6.81% to 39.08%. Average grades are
11.9% antimony (Sb), 843 g/t silver (Ag) and 18.0% lead (Pb).
Table 1. Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit surface sample assays
- taken at 5m intervals along 50m strike traverse
Figure 6. Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit - surface sample positions
Cautionary Statement: Grab sampling is selective in nature with resultant assay grades considered to be qualitative
rather than quantitative and not necessarily representative of underlying mineralisation which may actually be lower or
higher in grade.

Montezuma Antimony Project Diamond Drilling
To date 13 diamond drill holes have intercepted mineralisation at the Montezuma antimony-silver-
lead deposit, 4 holes from the hanging wall (MZSHW1-4) and 8 holes from the footwall (MZSFW1-
8). Diamond drill core samples have graded up to 20.3% antimony (Sb), 1,990 g/t silver (Ag) and
27.0% lead (Pb). This is in addition to the historical Electrolytic Zinc (EZ) hole MZP245A.

Drilling to date has primarily been designed to target the Montezuma antimony-silver-lead deposit
ahead of adit drive development. The southern most hole (MZSFW7) resulted in an intercept of 4m
(16.7m to 20.7m) grading 6.04% Sb, 8.18% Pb, 620 g/t Ag including an individual assay of 0.5m
(19.7m to 20.2m) at 20.3% Sb, 26.7% Pb, 824 g/t Ag.

Currently the Montezuma Antimony Project has approval to bulk sample 1,000t from a 50m
exploration drive. This will allow better definition of the mineralised lode through face mapping and
sampling as well as the establishment of suitable drill positions for deeper drilling. It is intended that
exploration drive development mineralisation will be processed through the project’s pilot scale
beneficiation plant. Currently, development mineralisation has been stockpiled for treatment at a
later date or even, potentially, sold as direct shipped ore (DSO).

Montezuma Antimony Project Beneficiation Plant
The Montezuma Antimony Project’s pilot scale beneficiation plant is located 15km to the northwest
of the Zeehan township. Infrastructure includes connection to grid power, cone crusher, ball mill,
gravity tables, spirals, tankage, raw water and a recently constructed tailings dam. Trial pilot scale
beneficiation treatment of Montezuma mineralisation is planned once metallurgical parameters,
tankage configuration and permitting are finalised.

Significant bench scale metallurgical work has been carried out to date by Core Resources, a
Brisbane based metallurgical project development firm. Finalisation of this work is needed. “Core
has completed flowsheet design, test work and engineering plans for the Montezuma Antimony
Project. This work has involved developing an innovative approach to recovering antimony from
Jamesonite, whilst recovering silver and lead by-products in a low-cost and straightforward process
flowsheet that could be implemented on site using readily available equipment.”1
Metallurgical test work (See Figure 13) on a batch of development mineralisation involved bulk
leaching, hydrocycloning remaining solids to produce a separate a Pb/Ag product (See Table 8),
oxidation, crystallization and precipitation of an antimony compound with a 90% antimony recovery
and 47% antimony content by weight was achieved.
The resultant product sodium pyroantimonate (Na Sb O ) is primarily used as a glass clarifier and,
4 2 7
given its application in solar panels, has particularly strong demand growth. Additional metallurgical
test work may include the production of synthetic antimony (Sb S ). This product has smelter
2 3
applications, in particular as a harder in lead alloys. Testwork to date has primarily focused on
maximising antimony recoveries. Further metallurgical work is needed to determine silver and lead
recoveries, however high-grade concentrate grading 2,575 g/t Ag and 60% Pb has already been
achieved.

Montezuma Antimony Project Exploration Potential
The deepest drill hole to date is MZP245A drilled by the Electrolytic Zinc Company(EZ) in 1983.
Resampling of this core, stored at the Tasmanian Geological Survey has shown a mineralised
intercept of 0.63m grading 11.58% antimony (Sb), 683 g/t silver (Ag) and 25.64% lead (Pb). This
hole has been sampled only for what was considered the highest-grade mineralisation so further
assaying is needed of the remaining mineralised core to determine full intercept width. Importantly,
this intercept demonstrates the potential continuity of mineralisation at depth. Given that
mineralised lode thickness pinches and swells along strike at surface, it is also likely that this also
occurs at depth and thus forming steep plunging shoots within the Motezuma lode structure. This
is often the result of structural “kinks” and identifying these is important in defining drill targets within
the lode structure, both at depth and laterally along strike.
