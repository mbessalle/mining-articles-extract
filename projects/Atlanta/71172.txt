# NEVADA KING ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF SILVER PARK OPTION IN LINCOLN COUNTY, NEVADA

VANCOUVER, BC, Sept. 12, 2024 /CNW/ - **Nevada King Gold Corp.**(TSXV: NKG) (OTC: NKGFF) ("**Nevada King** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that the Company has completed the acquisition (the "**Acquisition** ") of an option to purchase a 100% undivided interest in the property known as the Silver Park property (the "**Property** "). Silver Park is located within the Atlanta Project boundary, totals approximately 24 hectares, and is comprised of three contiguous patented land parcels described as the Summit lode mining claim, the Sam Tilden lode mining claim, and the Roadside lode mining claim in Lincoln County, Nevada.

Cal Herron, Exploration Manager of Nevada King, commented: "This option agreement secures third-party land within the Atlanta claim package that was not previously controlled by Nevada King and, importantly, adds further patented (private) ground to the Atlanta Project. Private land, as opposed to BLM (US government) land, offers increased flexibility for permitting and siting of mine/mill infrastructure in the event of a future possible mining scenario at Atlanta."

**Silver Park Overview:**

Silver and gold mineralization were discovered at Silver Park in 1869. Production began in 1871 and two mills had been built by 1872. Very minor undocumented production, primarily silver, was mined from several shafts and drifts around the property, but high-grade silver values proved to be shallow and did not generally extend to depths much deeper than 10m. In 1975, extensive shallow rotary drilling was conducted in the Silver Park area, which defined a small zone of near-surface mineralization. Silver Park mineralization is hosted in northeast and north trending zones within the Ely Springs Dolomite with shallow supergene enrichment along fractures, bedding planes, and joints.

**Terms of the Option:**

In connection with the Acquisition, Nevada King entered into an option for purchase and sale dated July 30, 2024 (the "**Option Agreement** ") with Ofor Silver, LLC ("**Ofor Silver** "). As consideration for the option under the Option Agreement, the Company has today issued to Ofor Silver, 100,000 common shares of the Company (the "**Consideration Shares** ") at a deemed value of $0.41 per Consideration Share (being the closing price of the Consideration Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange (the "**TSXV** ") on July 29, 2024, the last trading day prior to execution of the Option Agreement) for aggregate consideration of $41,000. The issuance of the Consideration Shares remains subject to TSXV final approval and other customary conditions and filings.

The Option Agreement provides that Nevada King may purchase a 100% undivided legal interest in the Property from Ofor Silver by paying Ofor Silver the sum of US$75,000 before July 30, 2034.

Ofor Silver is at arm's length to Nevada King. No finders fees or commissions are payable by the Company in connection with the Acquisition.
