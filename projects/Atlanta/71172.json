Silver Park is located within the Atlanta Project boundary, totals approximately 24 hectares, and is comprised of three contiguous patented land parcels described as the Summit lode mining claim, the Sam Tilden lode mining claim, and the Roadside lode mining claim in Lincoln County, Nevada . Cal Herron , Exploration Manager of Nevada King , commented: \"This option agreement secures third-party land within the Atlanta claim package that was not previously controlled by Nevada King and, importantly, adds further patented (private) ground to the Atlanta Project.
