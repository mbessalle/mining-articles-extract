# Rush Rare Metals Announces Expansion of Copper Mountain Project

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / February 27, 2024 / Rush Rare Metals Corp.** ("**Rush** " or the "**Company** ") (CSE:RSH) is pleased to announce the staking of the Knob claims in Wyoming, comprised of 52 mineral claims aggregating 780 acres. The claims now form part of Rush's Copper Mountain Project, which is the subject of an option/earn-in agreement between Rush and Myriad Uranium Corp. ("Myriad"), pursuant to which Myriad can earn a 50% interest in the project by spending $1.5m exploring Copper Mountain, and 75% by spending a total of $5.5m, with Myriad shares and other incentives triggered for Rush at certain progress thresholds (see Rush news release dated October 20, 2023 for further details).

"This clearly demonstrates a part of the ongoing value of the new data found surrounding previous work at Copper Mountain," said Peter Smith, CEO of Rush. "Not only does the data give the project an enormous head-start in terms of exploration within our current clam area, but it also gives us some fantastic data regarding other uranium previously encountered in the immediate area. Knob itself has historical work showing huge uranium potential, and there are other areas indicated in the materials as being highly prospective, which we are acquiring. As the data was mostly collected many years ago, a great deal of it is ‘paper only', and thus, we are among the only people with access to it. It's possible that in our partnership with Myriad, and through access to this data, we will have the ability to compile a uranium district at Copper Mountain, with multiple high-confidence uranium targets based on millions in historical spending."
