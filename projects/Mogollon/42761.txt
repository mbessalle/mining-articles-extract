# Summa Silver Earns 100% Interest in the High-Grade Silver and Gold Mogollon Project in New Mexico

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 19, 2023) - **Summa Silver Corp.** **(TSXV: SSVR) (OTCQX: SSVRF) (FSE: 48X)** ("Summa" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it is completing all option payments to Allegiant Gold Ltd. ("Allegiant") (TSXV: AUAU) for the Mogollon Project near Silver City, New Mexico (the "Project" or "Mogollon") to earn 100% ownership of the Project. 

**Galen McNamara, CEO, stated:** "Over the past three years, exploration results from Mogollon have shown that it has the potential to be one of the best silver and gold vein fields remaining in the United States. This is a project that we're very happy to own 100%. The world is now changing rapidly. We strongly believe that in the coming years responsibly tapping domestic sources of metals will be vital to both financial security and the green energy transition. I would like to thank Allegiant for their collaborative approach since we optioned the Project in 2020. I'm looking forward to continuing to collaborate closely and welcome them as significant shareholders of the Company."

**Mogollon Project Payment**

In connection with the option and joint venture agreement dated August 21, 2020, between the Company and Allegiant regarding the Project (the "Option Agreement"), the Company intends to issue 8,912,884 common shares (the "Consideration Shares") at a deemed price of $0.4579 per Consideration Share to Allegiant pursuant to the Option Agreement. Upon issuance of the Consideration Shares, the Company will have satisfied the requirements to exercise the phase two option pursuant to the Option Agreement and acquire 100% ownership of the Project. The Company expects to issue the Consideration Shares in the coming days. The Consideration Shares will have a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance. 

**About Summa Silver Corp**

Summa Silver Corp. is a junior mineral exploration company. The Company owns a 100% interest in the Hughes project located in central Nevada and, upon issuance of the Consideration Shares, will own a 100% interest in the Mogollon project located in southwestern New Mexico. The high-grade past-producing Belmont Mine, one of the most prolific silver producers in the United States between 1903 and 1929, is located on the Hughes project. The Mogollon project is the largest historic silver producer in New Mexico. Both projects have remained inactive since commercial production ceased and neither have seen modern exploration prior to the Company's involvement.
