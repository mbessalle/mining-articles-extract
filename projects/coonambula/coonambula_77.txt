ASX Release
12 March 2025
GDM to Farm-Out Coonambula Antimony-Gold Project
Highlights
• GDM has signed a binding agreement with Dart Mining NL (ASX:DTM) to farm-out GDM’s
Coonambula Project including the historic Banshee Antimony Mine.
• DTM will initially take a 15% holding in the 6 exploration tenements (5 granted and one in
application) by paying to GDM $250,000 in cash, extending to 51% by DTM conducting a
minimum of 4,000m of drilling and preparing 2 geological and resource reports over a 2-
year period.
• DTM has been appointed Manager to operate the Coonambula JV.
• Tenements are historically under explored with limited sampling and drilling; this presents a
significant upside to both DTM and GDM.
• The agreement is subject to a 90-day due diligence period and DTM Shareholder approval.
• This agreement confirms GDM’s material advancement, consistent with the Company’s
strategic plan, to progress from “explorer” to “explorer-miner-producer”.
Chief Executive Offer, Justin Haines, commented:
“GDM was formed to rapidly evolve into a cash-flow mining business, deriving revenues
whilst conserving shareholder capital. This agreement secures for GDM a partner to advance
exploration at Coonambula’ s advanced antimony and gold prospects, with significant on-
groundwork including 4,000m of drilling. This enables GDM to further focus on project
development, operation, and near-term cash-flow.”
Overview
