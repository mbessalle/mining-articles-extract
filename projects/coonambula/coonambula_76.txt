DART MINING ENTERS BINDING FARM-IN AGREEMENT OVER THE
ADVANCED COONAMBULA ANTIMONY-GOLD PROJECT IN QUEENSLAND
The Directors of Dart Mining NL (ASX:DTM) (Dart Mining or the Company) are pleased to announce
the entry into a binding Term Sheet (Agreement) with Great Divide Mining (ASX:GDM) to earn up to
51% interest in 6 tenements forming the Coonambula Antimony-Gold Project located in Central
Queensland (For Binding Farm-In Key Terms please see Appendix One below).
HIGHLIGHTS
• The Coonambula antimony-gold mineralisation is interpreted to be similar to the style
represented at Hillgrove, NSW (Larvotto Resources Ltd (ASX: LRV)) also hosted within the New
England Orogen
• Highlights from 2014 drilling as per the GDM Prospectus (ASX: GDM Prospectus 2023):
o 3m @ 9.18% Sb in hole CNRC03 from 158m
o 6m @ 5.12% Sb & 1.55g/t Au in hole CNRC04 from 77m
o 3m @ 1.50% Sb & 8.53g/t Au in hole CNRC05 from 18m
• Rock chips of 44.9% Sb, 24.1% Sb, 39.9% Sb, and 39.4% Sb (ASX: GDM Prospectus 2023):
• Surface trenching includes 4m@ 3.09g/t Au and 1.14% Sb and 1m @ 6.15 g/t Au and 3.1% Sb.
While trenching, selective rock chips returned 3.65g/t Au with 23.9% Sb, and 9.93g/t Au with
7.56% Sb (ASX: GDM Nov 2024).
• Limited modern exploration, and no drilling since 2014, the project holds potential to define a
significant intrusion related gold system within a region of Queensland hosting similar multiple
multimillion ounce gold resources.
• Dart will undertake initial drilling to infill existing high-grade Sb-Au drill intersections at the
historical Banshee Mine with the intent of working towards a JORC-compliant resource of
antimony-gold at the earliest opportunity (subject to successful infill drill results).
• The project is strategically located approximately 130km from the company’s flagship Triumph
gold project where the company continues progressing its initial 7,000m diamond drill
program.
• The Farm-In Agreement provides a unique opportunity to utilise the Company’s existing
diamond drill rigs, crews and infrastructure.

Dart’s Chairman, James Chirnside, commented: “Coonambula is an advanced antimony-gold
exploration project with the opportunity to conduct rapid infill drilling at the historic Banshee antimony
mine where previous drill intersections included high-grade antimony to 9.18% Sb. With antimony being
declared a critical and strategic metal, and the ban on exports from China, antimony prices have
increased strongly. Coonambula positions Dart to the forefront of antimony exploration in one of
Australia’s best antimony address’, the New England Orogen that also hosts Larvotto’s Hillgrove gold-
antimony mine and Trigg’s Wild Cattle Creek antimony deposit. We will be drilling with the intent to
declare a JORC-compliant antimony-gold resource at the historic Banshee Mine at the earliest
opportunity.”

COONAMBULA ANTIMONY-GOLD PROJECT
The Coonambula Antimony-Gold Project (Coonambula or Project) is located approximately 390km by
road north-northwest of Brisbane, Queensland. Coonambula is 70km southeast of the multi-million-
ounce Cracow gold mine and 25km southwest of the Eidsvold goldfield (Figure 3). The Project is
comprised of six granted Exploration Permits: EPM 15203, EPM 16216, EPM 25260, EPM 26743, EPM
28433 and EPM 29186 covering 282 sq.km., and application EPM 29186 covering an area of 227sq.km.
Work to be undertaken - Dart will drill approximately 2000m in the first year and model the Banshee
Sb-Au lode for a possible JORC resource. Drilling will be infill between existing holes and surface
trenching (Figure 5) designed to be suitable for declaration of a JORC resource at the earliest
opportunity subject to successful drill results. Year one plans are to use existing drilling and new infill
holes to complete section lines 20-30m apart in the core 300m antimony rich zone of the Banshee
lode. Three or four holes per section are intended. The second year 2000m will be drilled to expand
Banshee, drill gold targets at Perseverance and nearby intrusion related gold system targets. At
Banshee drilling will extend along strike into the gold rich zones to the east and west and to follow
high-grade antimony zones below previous and first year drilling (for example drill hole CNRC03
shows an existing intersection of 3m@9.18% Sb at approximately 140m below ground).

Figure 3 – Project Location Plan.
Geology – New England Fold Belt geology hosts high grade quartz veins hosted Sb-Au at Hillgrove
Wild Cattle Creek in NSW, and Antimony at Neardie near Gympie QLD. Mineralisation at Coonambula
is hosted within intrusive granodiorites and holds the potential to host a large intrusion related gold
system, with attractive magnetic signature and structural geology.
Two distinct types of reef mineralisation occur: Gold associated with arsenopyrite in quartz and high-
grade antimony with calcite in quartz. Disseminated stibnite is recorded in the gold lodes (Malnic,
1985).
Banshee is one of the largest historical antimony mining complexes in Central Queensland, located
70km Southeast of the Cracow gold mine and 25km SW of Eidsvold. Banshee is a historic high-grade
direct shipping ore antimony mine (variously between 1876 and 1983, The Banshee Mine when
reopened in 1983 produced 20t of ore containing 4t of Antimony (GDM Prospectus 2023). 12 RC and 1
diamond drill hole have been drilled over 650m of strike length at Banshee.
Directly east of Banshee lies another Antimony-Gold prospect called Lady Mary (previously called
Lady May). This prospect lies 1km along strike from Banshee, potentially along the same E-W Banshee
structure. Surface rock chip samples from old mine dumps at Lady Mary have returned up to 49.6%
Sb and 1.3 g/t Au (GDM Sep 2024). The area between Banshee and Lady Mary has not yet been
explored and is a high priority target.
4 | P a ge

The Perseverance mine was mined to 132m depth with mining widths up to 10m wide (GDM
Prospectus 2023). Past production of gold from the mine was reported as 20kt @ 20g/t Au (Malnic,
1985) however only 3 drill holes completed to date.
Total strike of the prospective antimony zone is approximately 5km with historic mines either side of
Banshee. Lady Mary located 900m east of Banshee with additional historic mines occurring some
3km west of Banshee giving a potential E-W strike of 5km. Individual high grade antimony shoots are
interpreted as having a strike length of 30-100m each based upon Banshee drilling where 3 shoots of
this length exist in the central core zone.
In GDM’s 2023 prospectus (GDM Prospectus 2023) consulting company Derisk stated that it: “Considers
that the Coonambula project tenements are prospective for mesothermal vein and stockwork gold
and gold-antimony deposits, as well as intrusion-related and epithermal gold deposits. Most work at
this project has focused on areas in and around historical mine workings. Derisk considers there is
potential to define extensions or repetitions of known mineralisation at some of the historical
workings. There is also potential to discover new mineralisation but exploration for these targets is at
a very early stage.”

NEXT STEPS
Dart Mining will progress farm-in exploration at Coonambula. In the first year of the farm-in Dart
intends to:
• Finalise the Definitive agreements within 90 days.
• Undertake Cultural Heritage Assessment of the proposed first year drilling locations at
the Banshee Antimony Mine (approximately 6-8 weeks).
• Finalise and commence a closely spaced infill drilling programme at Banshee, using one
of Darts’ inhouse Diamond Drill Rigs, with a view to the declaration of an antimony-gold
JORC resource at the earliest opportunity subject to successful drilling between existing
antimony-gold drill intersections.
• Undertake a detailed IP geophysical survey over 1.5km of strike at the Banshee antimony
lode subject to a successful outcome of a grant application in the Queensland Government
Collaborative Exploration Initiative Round 9, (12-line km of dipole-dipole IP survey data
- 15 x 800 m lines, 100 m line spacing, 25 m dipoles).
• Review and identify additional prospective historic mine targets for exploration at
Coonambula with a focus on antimony workings along strike from Banshee (for example
Lady Mary 1km along strike to the east) and gold workings such as Perseverance and
Burnett Squatter.
• Assess existing historical exploration data for the potential to host epithermal and
intrusion related gold deposits in the EPMs.
• Continue to progress drilling at its Flagship Triumph Gold Project as planned.

About Dart Mining
The Triumph Gold Project is Dart’s first step into an advanced intrusion related gold system project in
Queensland. Dart will look to develop a regional presence in Queensland through advanced stage intrusion
related and epithermal gold projects. Dart Mining will continue to evaluate several historic goldfields in
Central and Northeast Victoria including the Rushworth Goldfield and the new porphyry and lithium province
in Northeast Victoria identified by Dart. The area is prospective for precious, base, and strategic metals. Dart
Mining has built a strategic and highly prospective gold exploration portfolio in Central and Northeast regions
of Victoria, where historic surface and alluvial gold mining indicates the existence of potentially large gold
endowment.
