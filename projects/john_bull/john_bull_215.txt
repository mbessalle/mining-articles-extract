JOHN BULL GOLD PROJECT
Location and Tenure
John Bull is located in the New England Orogen of NSW. The tenure consists of two tenements and
covers some 32 sq km (Figure 2, Table 1).
Table 1 John Bull Gold Project tenement details
Tenement Number Grant Date Expiry Date Number of Blocks Area sq km
EL 8389 03/09/2015 03/09/2028 1 3 TechG
EL 9121 01/04/2021 01/04/2027 11 29 TechG
Geology and Mineralisation
Mineralisation at John Bull is interpreted to be part of a reduced IRG system. It is characterised by
abundant sheeted and stockwork veins with associated sulphides and is hosted within Carboniferous
sediments and felsic intrusions (Figure 3). The mineralisation lies within the thermal aureole of a
large northeast-trending Triassic I-type granite, which is of the same age as the Timbarra Gold Mine.
Gold mineralisation in the form of sheeted, low-sulphide quartz veins trend NNE and ENE and dip 40
to 60 degrees to the ESE in a 250 m wide corridor, crosscutting bedding. Mineralisation includes
native gold in a low sulphide system with pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite and minor magnetite.
Previous Exploration
Historic
Gold discovered in 1872 was worked from at least three shafts up to 20 m deep8. Subsequent and
extensive hydraulic sluicing of elluvial material of three areas was conducted. The main area of
sluicing has exposed numerous sheeted quartz veins in the south of the project area and was the
target of drilling conducted by TechGen in 2022 / 2023.
Kennecott / Southern Goldfields Trenching and Sampling
Between 1983 and 1985, Kennecott / Southern Goldfields completed a 220 m long costean dug by
a backhoe, which has since been infilled and rehabilitated. The trench was excavated perpendicular
to veins and cut through the main exposed vein arrays in Sluice Area 1 resulting in an intersection of
160 m @ 1.2 g/t Au (Figure 4) from 5 m composite samples (no top cut applied), and including
higher grades such as 5 m @ 18.0 g/t Au and 5 m @ 7.1 g/t Au9. Assaying included screen fire
assay on twelve samples, which show the presence of coarse gold. The project may significantly
benefit from alternate modern assay techniques such as 500 g or multipot Chrysos PhotonAssay™
analysis to better quantify this coarse gold component.
Sample results may not be representative of mineralisation in the district. No assurance can be given
that Novo will achieve similar results as part of its exploration activities.
TechGen Geochemical Sampling
More recently, TechGen defined a significant, high-order surface geochemical gold anomaly over 900
m strike and 250 m width at > 100 ppb Au (Figure 4), with seven soil samples > 4.5 g/t Au and a
peak assay of 10.0 g/t Au10. The soil anomaly remains open along strike to the north. A second
smaller anomaly occurs in the south, with the entire system thus far defined over 1.3 km strike.
TechGen completed 743 samples at 50 m x 50 m and locally down to 25 m x 25 m resulting in
assays with 47 samples > 1 g/t Au. Refer to Appendix 2 for all results > 100 ppb Au soil samples.

ESG Criteria
Novo has an ongoing commitment to operating in a safe, responsible and environmentally
sustainable manner. Novo carries out exploration activities mindful that it has a responsibility to
manage the land on which it operates to ensure it minimises its impacts. Novo develops and
implements Environmental Management Plans specific to the regions in which it operates.
Novo is committed to developing strong relationships with all its stakeholders. This is achieved
through open and honest communications.
Heritage and Native Title
The TechGen tenements fall within the Grafton-Ngerrie Local Aboriginal Council. There are no
Native Title Determinations or active Claims over the tenements. This area will be monitored for the
lodgment of a new claim. If a claim is lodged, consultation will occur with the new representative
body/traditional owners to ensure informed consent for exploration in the area.

TIBOOBURRA GOLD PROJECT
Location and Tenure
Tibooburra is located in the northwest of NSW, Australia approximately 280 km north of the Broken
Hill Pb-Zn-Ag mine and includes six granted exploration licences over ~ 630 sq km (Figure 7).
The tenure consists of five tenements within and along strike of the Albert Goldfields and one
tenement (EL 9094) situated further west, covering a large magnetic high with co-incident gravity
low (Table 2). Tenure is held by Awati Resources Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Manhattan.

Geology and Mineralisation
Tibooburra covers ~55 km of strike along the Tibooburra and Koonenberry Greenstone Belts in
northwestern NSW. The Albert Goldfields is an historical field located in the north of the project
area, discovered in 1881 and mined in earnest until 1901 with a recorded production of
approximately 55,000 oz Au at mining grades of +20 g/t Au2.
The Albert Goldfields lies on a unique district-scale jog at the boundary of the Thomson and
Delamarian orogens, with stratigraphy wrapping around the Tibooburra granite intrusive complex to
the northeast (Figure 8). Mineralisation is described as narrow high-grade (to super high-grade)
quartz veins hosted in the folded and faulted Cambrian sedimentary host rocks, and broadly falls
under the classification of turbidite-hosted/slate-belt gold.
The Project area itself displays more than 200 historic workings and over 34 km of mineralised trend
on multiple lines of workings (Figure 9). Several immediate targets have been delineated by previous
workers including New Bendigo, Clone, Pioneer, Elizabeth Reef and Good Friday. However, outside
the New Bendigo prospect little systematic modern exploration has been conducted. The area is
significantly under-explored, and satellite imagery and interpretation (Figure 9) shows abundant
cover including:
North and south of New Bendigo;
South of Clone, the trend is essentially under cover for >10 km; and
Regionally, south of the kink there is 60 km strike with no outcrop.
Two advanced drill ready target areas are defined at New Bendigo and Clone (and the associated
Clone Trend).
Previous Exploration
Overview
Manhattan entered into an agreement to acquire the Tibooburra Project from Awati Resources
Limited in late 201916. Since then, Manhattan has drilled several aircore (AC) traverses, and
targeted RC and diamond drilling, with particular focus around the New Bendigo Target. A short RC
drill program was completed in 2023 at Clone. Manhattan’s exploration programs were disrupted in
2020 due COVID and border closures, delaying many programs.
Prior to Manhattan, work across the licence area included soil, stream and rock chip sampling
programs, broad RAB and AC drilling traverses, regional geophysics (magnetics and gravity), RC and

and a Competent Person/Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to disclose the exploration
results in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 or NI 43-101. It is possible that following further
evaluation and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior reported exploration results may
be reduced when reported under the JORC Code 2012 or NI 43-101. Novo confirms that nothing
has come to its attention that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability of the results included
in the WAMEX Reports, but Novo has not independently validated those results and therefore is not
to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results.
New Bendigo Prospect
The prospect shows extensive historical workings at surface over 2 km strike. Several historical drill
programs, including RC and diamond drilling by Manhattan in 2020-2022 testing over 530 m strike
intersected multiple high order gold results. Extremely high-grade gold has been observed, hosted in
laminated quartz veins in historical diamond drilling (Figure 10).
Peak results from Manhattan drilling include17:
30 m at 4.03 g/t Au from 11 m, including 5 m at 20.86 g/t Au (NB0033)
16 m at 13.89 g/t Au from 1 m, including 3 m at 69.20 g/t Au (NB0083)
8 m at 40.5 g/t Au from 70 m, including 3 m at 105.34 g/t Au (NB0089)
7 m at 13.10 g/t Au from 97 m, including 5 m at 18.01 g/t Au (NB0113)
13 m at 6.16 g/t Au from 50 m, including 3 m at 25.48 g/t Au (NB0122)
24 m @ 3.55 g/t Au from 82 m including 4 m @ 20.11 g/t Au (NBD005 -Figure 10)
Refer to Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 for a list of all significant intercepts for New Bendigo diamond
and RC drilling results.
The prospect provides an opportunity for high-grade resource development once geological controls
and continuity are resolved. Potential for repeated lodes at depth and along an interpreted shallow
plunge is also good. Substantial drill step outs down dip and down plunge will be required to test for
blind mineralisation and stacked lodes.
Sample results may not be representative of mineralisation in the district. No assurance can be given
that Novo will achieve similar results as part of its exploration activities.
Cautionary Statement: Visual estimates of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or
substitute for laboratory analyses where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal
economic interest. Visual estimates also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or
deleterious physical properties relevant to valuations.
Clone Prospect
The Clone prospect is characterised by numerous historical workings over a ~ 450 m strike length, to
depths of up to 25 m. Multiple parallel mineralised trends are targeted, with the densest population
of historic workings occurring over a zone locally up to 130 m wide.
The Clone prospect occupies the middle of an approximately 10 km section of largely unexplored
ground along a prospective northwest-trending fault corridor that stretches from the New Bendigo
Prospect to the southeast; and the Pioneer Prospect to the northwest.
Peak drill results from 11 RC holes drilled in 2023 over 250 m strike to a maximum depth below
surface of 75 m, include19:
7 m at 7.23 g/t Au from 81 m, including 3 m at 16.1 g/t Au (CL0007)
9 m at 6.03 g/t Au from 16 m (CL0010)
6 m at 4.22 g/t Au from 66 m, including 2 m at 11.65 g/t Au (CL0004)
31 m at 1.29 g/t Au from 60 m, including 3 m at 6.52 g/t Au (CL0002)
Mineralisation at Clone remains open in all directions, with targeted mineralised basement trending
under cover sediments to the south. The cover sediments extending for some 15 km and providing
opportunities for exploration targeting potential ‘blind discoveries.’
Sample results may not be representative of mineralisation in the district. No assurance can be given
that Novo will achieve similar results as part of its exploration activities.
A full list of significant intercepts for Clone 2022 RC drilling is listed in Appendix 4.
Cautionary Statement: Visual estimates of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or
substitute for laboratory analyses where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal
economic interest. Visual estimates also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or
deleterious physical properties relevant to valuations.

ABOUT NOVO
Novo is an Australian based gold explorer listed on the ASX and the TSX focused on discovering
standalone gold projects with > 1 Moz development potential. Novo is an innovative gold explorer
with a significant land package covering approximately 5,500 square kilometres in the Pilbara region
of Western Australia, along with the 22 square kilometre Belltopper project in the Bendigo Tectonic
Zone of Victoria, Australia.
Novo’s key project area in the Pilbara is the Egina Gold Camp, where De Grey Mining is farming-in to
form a JV at the Becher Project and surrounding tenements through exploration expenditure of
A$25 million within 4 years for a 50% interest. The Becher Project has similar geological
characteristics as De Grey’s 12.7 Moz Hemi Project*. Novo is also advancing gold exploration south
of Becher in the Egina Gold Camp, part of the Croydon JV (Novo 70%: Creasy Group 30%). Novo
continues to undertake early-stage exploration elsewhere across its Pilbara tenement portfolio.
Novo has also formed a lithium joint venture with SQM in the Pilbara which provides shareholder
exposure to battery metals.
Novo has recently strengthened its high-quality, Australian based exploration portfolio by adding the
TechGen John Bull Gold Project in the New England Orogen of NSW, and Manhattan Tibooburra
Gold Project in the Albert Goldfields in northwestern NSW. Both projects demonstrate prospectivity
for significant discovery and resource definition and align with Novo’s strategy of identifying and
exploring projects with > 1 Moz Au potential. These high-grade gold projects compliment the
landholding consolidation that forms the Toolunga Project in the Onslow District in Western
Australia.
Novo has a significant investment portfolio and a disciplined program in place to identify value
accretive opportunities that will build further value for shareholders.
Please refer to Novo’s website for further information including the latest Corporate Presentation.
An Exploration Target as defined in the JORC Code (2012) is a statement or estimate of the
exploration potential of a mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement or
estimate, quoted as a range of tonnes and a range of grade (or quality), relates to mineralisation for
which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. Accordingly, these
figures are not Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve estimates as defined in the JORC Code (2012). The
potential quantities and grades referred to above are conceptual in nature and there has been
insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will
result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. These figures are based on the interpreted continuity
of mineralisation and projection into unexplored ground often around historical workings. The
Exploration Target has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). as detailed in the
Company’s ASX announcement released on 25 September 2024 (available to view at
www.asx.com.au). The Tonnage range for the exploration target is 1.5Mt to 2.1Mt and the Grade
range is 6.6g/t Au to 8.4g/t Au. The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information
that material affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all
material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the original market
announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. The Company confirms that the
form and context in which the Competent Person’s findings are presented have not been materially
modified from the original market announcement.
*Refer to De Grey ASX Announcement, Hemi Gold Project Resource Update, dated 21 November
2023 No assurance can be given that a similar (or any) commercially viable mineral deposit will be
determined at Novo’s Becher Project.nt and that all material assumptions and technical parameters
underpinning the estimates in the original market announcement continue to apply and have not
materially changed.

s | These relationships are
particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the
mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the
down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear
statement to this effect (e.g.,
‘down hole length, true width not
known’). |  | John Bull Project
Trenching and drilling is perpendicular to the
mineralised vein orientation and oblique to
stratigraphy. Drill hole dip angles at 60
degrees provide intercepts that are close to
true width (estimated 80 to 90%)
Tibooburra Project
All intervals reported are down hole intervals.
Information and knowledge of the mineralised
systems are inadequate to estimate true
widths. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

(with scales) and tabulations of
