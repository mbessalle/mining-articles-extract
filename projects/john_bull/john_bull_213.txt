John Bull Gold Project Overview 
The John Bull Gold Project is located east of Glen Innes in northern New South Wales within the New England Orogen. 
Despite the presence of historical gold workings, the project had never been drilled prior to its acquisition by TechGen 
in June 2022. At the time of acquisition, the project included ‘walk-up and fully permitted’ drill targets, offering 
significant exploration potential. 
 
Historical Mining Activities 
The John Bull Gold Project contains approximately seven historical shafts, including the primary John Bull shaft, sunk 
in the mid-1880s following the initial discovery of gold. In the 1940s, two large areas were sluiced for free surface gold. 
During the 1980s, surface trenching by Kennecott and Southern Goldfields Ltd returned promising results, including 
160m @ 1.2 g/t Au, with higher-grade intervals of 5m @ 18.0 g/t Au and 5m @ 7.1 g/t Au. 
 
Modern Exploration 
In mid-August 2022, TechGen completed the first-ever drilling campaign at John Bull, consisting of seven Reverse 
Circulation (RC) holes for a total of 887 metres. This program successfully tested for bedrock gold mineralisation 
beneath historical workings, delivering standout results: 
• 
JBRC001: 68m @ 1.0 g/t Au from surface, including 23m @ 2.02 g/t Au. 
• 
JBRC007: 94m @ 0.95 g/t Au, including 66m @ 1.14 g/t Au from 32m. 
 
Additional Highlights 
• 
Historic surface trench: 160m @ 1.2 g/t Au. 
• 
Soil samples returning up to 10 g/t Au. 
• 
North Area: 1,000m x 250m 100ppb Au soils anomaly (open to the north). 
• 
South Area: 250m x 150m 100ppb Au soils anomaly. 
 
The John Bull Gold Project represents an orogenic gold system with significant scale and large tonnage potential from 
surface. TechGen remains committed to advancing the project through this collaborative farm-in agreement with 
Novo Resources Corp.
