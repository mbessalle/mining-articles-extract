ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 1 August 2024
Non-core Mt York ground sold to
Pilbara Minerals for $20m
Kairos retains 1.38Moz Mt York Resource and gains gold and base metal rights
over an additional 367sqkm of Pilbara tenements with known gold occurrences
Highlights
• Kairos has agreed to sell prospecting licences P45/2988, P45/2992, P45/2993,
P45/2995, P45/2997 and P45/2998 and the overlying mining lease application
(M45/1307) to Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) for a total consideration of $20m
and a 2% royalty on gold, lithium and tantalum sales
• The tenure being sold contains a gold resource of 0.23Moz in two small
satellite gold deposits that are non-core to the Mt York Gold Project
• Kairos to retain mining lease application M45/1306 which hosts the ‘Main
Trend’ of the Mt York Gold Project; This contains a JORC-compliant resource
of 43Mt at 1 g/t for 1,385,000 ounces over a continuous 3km zone
• Kairos and Pilbara Minerals each have the right to require the parties to
negotiate a mineral rights agreement in relation to all mineral rights
(except lithium and tantalum) over 367sqkm of neighbouring exploration
tenements and applications; This includes an additional 1.4km strike
extension of Mt York ‘Main Trend’ to the northwest with known gold
mineralisation including drill hits of 16m at 2.43 g/t Au (MYRC007)
• Once an agreement is in place in relation to the neighbouring exploration
tenements and applications, Kairos will target this additional ‘Main Trend’
strike extension as part of a minimum 5,000m RC and diamond drill
programme; It will be aimed at identifying higher-grade, near-surface
mineralisation to drive resource growth
• Scoping Study on the Mt York Gold Project has started under the auspices of
GR Engineering after an internal valuation exercise which confirmed that Mt
York has strong potential to be a high-value, robust gold mine
Kairos Managing Director, Dr Peter Turner said: “The $20m sale to Pilbara Minerals is
an attractive deal which will create significant value for our shareholders.

“The tenure being sold represents a small and non-core part of our Mt York Gold
Project, meaning we will retain the 1.38Moz Main Trend resource which underpins
the Mt York Gold Project and have access to a further 1.4km of the continuous Main
Trend mineralisation into the Pilbara ground that we know is well mineralised.
“In the process, we intend to obtain access to all mineral rights (except lithium and
tantalum) to a 367sqkm, prospective land package with known gold occurrences.
This area has untested exploration potential which we will be targeting for
accelerated resource growth as part of the upcoming drilling program”.
Kairos Chairman Zane Lewis commented:
“We intend to allocate a portion of the $20m to systematically grow the Mt York
gold resource and complete required development studies.
“By proposing to secure mineral rights to an additional 367sqkm of highly
prospective ground that has seen minimal modern day exploration, located
adjacent to the existing Mt York resource, we are positioning Kairos as a key player
in the area, driving our business towards a development scenario with significant
blue sky upside”.
Kairos Minerals Limited (ASX:KAI) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a
binding agreement to sell six prospecting licences and the overlying mining licence

Drillhole Collar Locations and Drillhole Intercepts compiled in Appendices 1 and 2
respectively and for notes in Appendix A, JORC Table 1, Sections 1 and 2 at the rear of
this announcement).
The full 1,400m of this largely untested but prospective geology contains known banded
iron formation that is mineralised at Mt York. Kairos is extremely confident that the
mineralisation will continue along-strike as the Pilbara Minerals’ drill holes are
mineralised on both the northern and southern lines confirming that mineralisation is
open along-strike to both the northwest and southeast, as well as at depth (Figure 2).
In addition, regional gold targets including Gilt Dragon with historic results of 19m @
1.31 g/t Au from 1m including 2m @ 6.6 g/t Au from 4m (GL15) (Figure 2) will be pattern-
drilled.
The application ELA 45/6298 to the south of Mt York which has similar banded iron
formation (BIF) rocks and stratigraphy to the Mt York area (Figures 1, 2 & 3). This area
has not been subject to any significant, systematic modern-day exploration programmes
over what is known to be very prospective geology for gold and base metals.
The Mt York Mineral Resource Estimate is shown in Table 2 and was first reported in the
press announcement dated 15 May 2023 (entitled ‘Resource increases to 1.6Moz and
remains open’). On the Completion Date there will be a change of ownership of the
prospecting licences holding the resources to Iron Stirrup and Old Faithful, and these
mineral resources shown in Table 2 will be excluded from Kairos’s gold resource
inventory for the Mt York Gold Project. These resources contained at the Iron Stirrup and
Old Faithful are relatively small satellite deposits containing only 14% of the total
resource inventory of the Mt York Gold Project and are located 5km and 7km respectively

Kairos’s 100%-owned Roe Hills Project, located 120km east of Kalgoorlie in WA’s Eastern Goldfields,
comprises an extensive tenement portfolio where the Company’s exploration work has confirmed the
potential for significant discoveries of high-grade gold, nickel, cobalt, lithium and rare earth
mineralisation. Kairos has recently discovered significant high-grade REE mineralisation at Black Cat within
enriched lower saprolite clays overlying fertile REE-bearing syenite intrusions.
