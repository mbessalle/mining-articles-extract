ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 5 September 2024
Completion of sale of non-core
tenements to Pilbara Minerals and
receipt of first $10M
Highlights
• $10M has been received from Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX:PLS) (‘PLS’) on
completion of the sale agreement announced by Kairos on August 1, 2024
(Sale Agreement)
• A further $10M in PLS shares or cash to be received following grant of
M45/1307 application or other agreed tenure over the same area
• Kairos retains mining lease application M45/1306 which hosts the ‘Main
Trend’ of the Mt York Gold Project; this contains a JORC-compliant resource
of 43Mt at 1 g/t for 1,385,000 ounces over a continuous 3km zone
• Following completion of the Sale Agreement, Kairos and Pilbara Minerals Ltd
each have the right to require the parties to negotiate a mineral rights
agreement in relation to all mineral rights (except lithium and tantalum)
over 367sqkm of neighbouring exploration tenements and applications; this
includes an additional 1.4km strike extension of Mt York ‘Main Trend’ to the
northwest with known gold mineralisation including drill hits of 16m at 2.43
g/t Au (MYRC007)
• Once an agreement is in place in relation to the neighbouring exploration
tenements and applications, Kairos will target this ‘Main Trend’ strike
extension as part of a 5,000m RC and diamond drill programme to identify
higher-grade, near-surface mineralisation to drive resource growth
• Scoping study on the Mt York Gold Project has started under the auspices of
GR Engineering after an internal valuation exercise which confirmed that Mt
York has strong potential to be a high-value, robust gold mine
Kairos Managing Director, Dr Peter Turner said: “We are pleased to have banked the
first $10M payment under the $20M sale agreement, adding to our approximately
$5M cash on hand. We look forward to working with the Pilbara team to enter an
agreement for all mineral rights (except lithium and tantalum) to the additional
367sqkm of prospective land package with known gold occurrences. This area has

untested exploration potential which we will be targeting for accelerated resource
growth as part of the upcoming drilling program”.
Kairos Chairman Zane Lewis commented:
“The cash payment provides Kairos with significant flexibility going forward to
evaluate additional opportunities whilst systematically growing the Mt York gold
resource and complete required development studies which are well advanced. We
will maintain a very tight control over expenditure as we move forward with the
development studies.”
Kairos Minerals Limited (ASX:KAI) is pleased to announce that it has achieved
completion under the agreement to sell six non-core prospecting licences and the
overlying mining licence application (M45/1307) for $20,000,000 to Pilgangoora
Operations Pty Ltd and Ngungaju Lithium Operations Pty Ltd, subsidiaries of Pilbara
Minerals Ltd (ASX:PLS) (‘Pilbara Minerals’).
Deal Terms and Structure
Under the sale agreement signed by all parties on 30 July 2024 Pilgangoora Operations
Pty Ltd (“POPL”) and Ngungaju Lithium Operations Pty Ltd (“NLO”) (both wholly-owned
subsidiary of ASX-listed Pilbara Minerals Ltd) agreed to acquire 100% of the right, title
and interest in the prospecting licences and the associated mining lease application for
$20,000,000 (Purchase Price) under the following structure:
(a) $10,000,000 cash on the Completion Date; (Now received)
(b) $10,000,000 cash or new Pilbara Minerals’ shares (at Pilbara Minerals’ election) 10
business days after the earlier of the Grant Date of the M45/1307 application or other
agreed tenure over the same area.
Royalty Deed
With effect from the grant of a mining lease over the ground that is the subject of the
M45/1307 application, a Royalty Deed is to be entered into by the parties giving Kairos
a 2% royalty on any lithium, tantalum and gold sales by POPL/NLO over this ground.
Mineral Rights
Furthermore, Kairos and POPL each have the right to require the parties to negotiate a
mineral rights agreement which will grant to Kairos the sole and exclusive right to
explore for minerals (except lithium and tantalum) over the ‘Gold Tenements’ (these
tenements and applications are shown in Figure 1). Kairos will grant to POPL or NLO a

Mt York Future Exploration and Resource Update
Once a mineral rights agreement has been entered into with POPL or NLO in relation to
the Gold Tenements, Kairos intends to access and explore the northwestern extension
of the Mt York Main Trend orebody on tenement E45/2241 (Figure 2) to follow-up on
Pilbara Minerals’ reconnaissance drilling in the area. Pilbara Minerals drilled
reconnaissance drilling methods to test only 800m of the total 1,400m of strike extension
of the Mt York stratigraphy. Most of the Pilbara Minerals’ drill holes reported gold
intersections and some ended in mineralisation. The results are shown on Figure 2 and
include:
- 12m @ 1.37 g/t from 80m (MYRC005)
- 16m @ 2.43 g/t Au from 16m (MYRC007)
- 4m @ 3.32 g/t Au from 4m (MYRC008)
- 6m @ 1.37 g/t Au from 84m (MYRC009)
- 8m @ 2.41 g/t Au from 44m (MYRC011)
- 2m @ 1.76 g/t Au from 116m (MYRC013)
- 5m @ 1.36 g/t Au from 173m (MYRC014)
- 15m @ 1.18 g/t Au from 13m (WSRC02)
(refer to Pilbara Mineral’s Quarterly Reports dated March 2020 and 2022; Refer to the
Drillhole Collar Locations and Drillhole Intercepts compiled in Appendices 1 and 2
respectively and for notes in Appendix A, JORC Table 1, Sections 1 and 2 at the rear of
KAI press announcement dated 1 August 2024 entitled ‘Non-core Mt York ground sold
to Pilbara Minerals for $20m’).
The full 1,400m of this largely untested but prospective geology contains known banded
iron formation that is mineralised at Mt York. Kairos is extremely confident that the
mineralisation will continue along-strike as the Pilbara Minerals’ drill holes are
mineralised on both the northern and southern lines confirming that mineralisation is
open along-strike to both the northwest and southeast, as well as at depth (Figure 2).
In addition, regional gold targets including Gilt Dragon with historic results of 19m @
1.31 g/t Au from 1m including 2m @ 6.6 g/t Au from 4m (GL15) (Figure 2) will be pattern-
drilled.
The application ELA 45/6298 to the south of Mt York which has similar banded iron
formation (BIF) rocks and stratigraphy to the Mt York area (Figures 1, 2 & 3). This area
has not been subject to any significant, systematic modern-day exploration programmes
over what is known to be very prospective geology for gold and base metals.

Updated Mineral Resource Estimate
The updated Mt York Mineral Resource Estimate is shown in Table 2 and was first
reported in the press announcement dated 15 May 2023 entitled ‘Resource increases to
1.6Moz and remains open’.
As at 4 September 2024 (“Completion Date”) there was a change of ownership of the
prospecting licences holding the resources to Iron Stirrup and Old Faithful, and these
mineral resources will, moving forward, be excluded from Kairos’ gold resource
inventory for the Mt York Gold Project. These resources contained at Iron Stirrup and
Old Faithful were relatively small satellite deposits containing only 14% of the previous
total resource inventory of the Mt York Gold Project and are located 5km and 7km
respectively from the Mt York Main Trend (Figure 2).
