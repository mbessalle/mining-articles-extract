About Firebird Metals Limited 
Firebird Metals is an advanced manganese developer focused on combining mining and 
downstream processing with a dedication to the advancement of the EV battery sector.  
The Company is currently progressing its unique China-focused lithium manganese iron 
phosphate (LMFP) battery strategy, which will develop Firebird into a near-term producer of 
high-purity, battery-grade manganese sulphate, a key cathode material in LMFP batteries for 
electric vehicles.  
Execution of this strategy will place Firebird at the forefront of manganese sulphate production, 
at a time when the use and demand for manganese in batteries continues to rapidly grow. Due 
to the low number of ASX-manganese developers and increasing use of LMFP by car 
manufacturers, Firebird is in a strong position to benefit from this growing market and deliver 
significant value to its shareholder base.  
The Company also owns 100% of its project portfolio, located in the renowned East Pilbara 
manganese province of Western Australia, which boasts a total Resource of 234Mt1,2, with 
exciting exploration and development growth upside. The portfolio is led by the flagship Oakover 
Project, which holds a Mineral Resource Estimate1 of 176.7 Mt at 9.9% Mn, with 105.8 Mt at 
10.1% Mn in an Indicated category.  
The Company’s other key Projects are Hill 616 and Wandanya which provide Firebird with 
compelling growth opportunities. Hill 616 contains an Inferred Mineral Resource2 of 57.5Mt at 
12.2% Mn and shares similar geological traits to Oakover. Wandanya is a high-grade exploration 
opportunity, with Direct Shipping Ore potential.  
The Company is committed to generating sustainable long-term value and growth for 
stakeholders, through the implementation of best practice exploration methods while 
prioritising the well-being, health and environmental protection of its employees and 
communities it operates in.
