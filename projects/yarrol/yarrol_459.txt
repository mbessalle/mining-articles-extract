1980's and 1990's led to the definition of two historical gold resources (see notes regarding the
historical mineral resources below). Gold mineralization at Yarrol is present as quartz sulfide veins
and zones of silicification developed in and around Permian-aged dioritic intrusions. EMX conducted a
two-hole confirmation drill program in late 2022, resulting in the intersection of 17.8 meters
averaging 4.01 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 61 meters in drill hole DD22-YA187, and 12 meters
at 0.91 g/t gold from 92 meters in drill hole DD22-YA188 (see EMX News Release dated November
14, 2022)2.
Many Peaks Gold Ltd (now Many Peaks Minerals Ltd or "Many Peaks", ASX:MPK) optioned the
project from EMX in 2023 and conducted various exploration programs before changing its strategy
to focus on western African projects in early 2024. In addition to other programs, Many Peaks drilled
six reconnaissance diamond drill holes at Yarrol totaling 1,210 meters that included a drill intercept
of 16 meters averaging 0.75 g/t gold from 42 meters in hole YAD-189 (see Many Peaks news
releases dated January 29 and 30, 2024)3. The project was returned to EMX in mid-2024.
Mt Steadman Project: The 5,760 hectare Mt Steadman project is an intrusion-related gold system
("IRGS") located along the Perry Fault system, a major structural feature in the region that also
hosts the nearby Mt Rawdon Mine. The Mt Steadman project was the focus of exploration in the
1990's when shallow reconnaissance drilling programs led to the recognition and definition of Project Summary Com
historical gold resources (see notes regarding the historical mineral resources below). Several
historic mines are also located on the Mt Steadman project (Mt Steadman, Venus and London), and
were initially worked in the 1880's with periodic production continuing into the 1940's.
In the 1990's mineralized sheeted vein swarms (IRGS-style mineralization) were recognized at the
Fitzroy prospect, where over 4,000 meters of shallow drilling led to the definition of historic gold
resources1. Examples of historical drill intercepts at Mt Steadman's Fitzroy prospect include reverse

development of the Monal Goldfields in the northwest portion of the EMX license. This area is
marked by historical shafts, adits, mine dumps and processing sites, where gold mineralization was
present in multiple parallel quartz vein reefs. Eight reef deposits were discovered and mined, with
the gold mineralization appearing to extend for several kilometers along strike.
Many Peaks optioned the Queensland Gold project from EMX in 2020 and executed several
exploration programs on the project. Many Peaks drilled twelve RC holes at Boggy Creek totaling
1,806 meters, and six additional reconnaissance drill holes elsewhere on the property (totaling 531

Comments on Historical Mineral Resources. The historical mineral resources at Yarrol and Mt
Steadman were reported in 2010 by MGT Mining Ltd, which was a publicly traded Australian
company (ASX: MGT) at the time of publication. Discussions of the projects and historic resources
can be found at: https://www.nsx.com.au/ftp/news/021723444.PDF. EMX has not done sufficient
work to verify the historical resources and is not considering these resources to be current or
compliant with NI43-101 standards. Additional drilling and sampling would be required to confirm
the resources, but EMX considers the published historical estimates to be relevant and reliable.
Comments on Nearby Mines and Deposits. The mines and deposits discussed in this news release
provide context for EMX's projects, which occur in similar geologic settings, but this is not necessarily
indicative that the Company's projects host similar styles, tonnages or grades of mineralization.
Dr. Eric P. Jensen, CPG, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 and employee
of the Company, has reviewed, verified and approved the disclosure of the technical information
