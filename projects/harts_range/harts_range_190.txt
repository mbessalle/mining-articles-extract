28 OCTOBER 2024 
 
 
 
 
CCZ COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF HARTS RANGE 
PROJECT & EXPANDS FOOTPRINT   
HIGHLIGHTS:  
o CCZ has met all conditions precedent necessary to progress acquiring 85% of the 
highly prospective Harts Range Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths Project1, 
circa 120km north-east from Alice Springs in the Northern Territory (NT) 
o Historical assays from 28 rock chip samples, sourced from outcropping pegmatites 
within the granted tenure, reported grades up to 23.2% Nb, 12.7% U and 12.7% 
Heavy Rare Earth Elements (including 2.85% Dy, 0.32% Tb, 14.9% Ta)1,2 
o With the recent field trip by CCZ’s geology team1 validating the Harts Range 
Project’s significant exploration potential, the Board is now mapping out forward 
plans to expedite development work commencing with the Cusp Prospect1:  
 The exploration campaign will comprise comprehensive surface sampling 
and geophysical surveys to generate priority targets to test-drill as well as 
collecting bulk samples for metallurgical test-work  
o Reflecting its high confidence in the region, CCZ has increased its footprint by 
~25% with a proximal exploration license application3 – “Harts Range East Project” 
– that has comparable underlying geology to the granted tenure (15km west): 
 The initial focus will comprise undertaking a desktop review to generate key 
insights for the inaugural post-grant exploratory field trip   
o The Board’s strategy to advance the NWQ Copper Project, possibly with a 
development partner, and divest the two remaining assets – BHA West Project 
(NSW) and Mkushi Project (Zambia) – remains on track 
o CCZ has enjoyed recent inflows of ~$730k, including proceeds from exiting the 
ASX: RIM4 position (lifting current liquid funds to ~$1.65m); pleasingly, the next 
value creating event for the Board is closing the sale of Cangai Copper Mine to 
ASX: IMI – currently valued at ~$1.6m5  
*** 
CASTILLO COPPER’S CHAIRMAN GED HALL COMMENTED: "Recognising the excellent 
exploration potential the Harts Range Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths Project delivers, 
the Board has moved swiftly to close out this transformational transaction and increase the footprint 
within the region. The Board is now working closely with the geology team to expedite ramping up 
the development campaign. Concurrently, the Board’s strategy to create value from non-core asset 
disposals is making solid progress: CCZ has exited its Rimfire Pacific Mining equity position and 
is working on closing the Cangai Copper Mine sale to ASX listed Infinity Mining.”

A NEW ERA COMMENCES   
Harts Range Project 
Castillo Copper Ltd’s (ASX: CCZ) (“CCZ”) Board, having ensured all conditions precedent have 
been satisfied, is delighted to confirm it is moving forward with acquiring 85% of the highly 
prospective Harts Range Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths Project via an earn-in 
arrangement (refer CCZ ASZ Release – 21 October 2024).  
Within the granted tenure are five prospects – Cusp, Bobs, Bobs West, Thorium Anomaly and 
Niobium Anomaly – where 28 assayed historical rock chips from outcropping pegmatites produced 
stellar grades up to 23.2% Nb, 12.7% U and 12.7% Heavy Rare Earth Elements (including 2.85% 
Dy, 0.32% Tb, 14.9% Ta)1,2. 
CCZ’s geology team recent field trip to the Harts Range Project was highly encouraging as it 
validated the tenure’s significant exploration potential. As a result, the Board is now working 
closely with the geology team to fast-track development work, initially focusing on the Cusp 
Project which shows consistently high Niobium, Heavy Rare Earths and Uranium grades1 (Figure 
1).

The objective of the exploration campaign is to undertake comprehensive surface sampling and 
geophysical surveys to generate priority targets to test-drill. Complementing this effort will be 
collecting bulk samples to simultaneously progress metallurgical test-work to ascertain if 
mineralisation will liberate easily.   
Harts Range East Project 
Following the geology team’s positive visit to the region, the Board decided to further expand the 
footprint given the encouraging prospectivity for Niobium, Heavy Rare Earths and Uranium 
mineralisation. As a result, CCZ has applied for incremental ground circa 15km east of the 
granted tenure – “Harts Range East Project” – which increases the footprint by circa 25% 
(~135km2).

As shown in Figure 2, the Harts Range East Project (~25km2) is in the central portion of the Enita 
Dome, with arguably comparable underlying geology to the granted tenure 15km west.   
Notably, the Entia Dome is underlain by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-igneous 
Complex), which predominantly consists of feldspar-biotite-amphibole-garnet gneisses. Moreover, 
the Harts Range region has undergone repeated and substantial crustal re-working between 
Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times. As a result, it is now believed to represent an ancient and 
strongly altered/metamorphosed version of a continental collision zone6. 
Magnetotelluric data interpreted by a team consisting of Adelaide University and NTGS 
geologists (Selway et al, 2006)7 suggests the Entia Dome system is a deep-crustal feature that 
can be shown extending to the mantle.

Similar to the granted tenure, the Harts Range East Project is readily accessible via a sealed 
highway and well-maintained tracks. Furthermore, given the close proximity of ASX-listed 
Independence Group’s (ASX: IGO) sizeable Irindina Project8, the mining infrastructure and 
access to a talented labour pool is first rate (Figure 3).  
The initial focus for the Harts Range East Project will comprise undertaking a desktop review to 
garner key insights for the maiden post-grant exploratory field trip.

NEXT STEPS 
To recap, the geology team intends to fully unpack the potential of the Harts Range Niobium, 
Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths Project through undertaking a systematic and rigorous 
exploration strategy that will encompass the following steps in subsequent visits: 
o Full historic and spatial database compilation;  
o Reconnaissance mapping programs;  
o Close spaced geophysical survey; 
o Detailed mapping and rock chip sampling across prospects; 
o Regional soil sampling campaigns as required; 
o Mineral characterisation studies and petrological analysis; 
o Trenching and bulk sample test work; 
o Target generation and prioritisation; and 
o Drill-testing. 
The Board of Castillo Copper Limited authorised the release of this announcement to
