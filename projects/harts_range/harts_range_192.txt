Source: Barfuss Corporation (Reference 1) 
o With global geopolitics and the energy transition Niobium, Uranium and Heavy 
Rare Earths are crucial commodities with strong long-term demand drivers for a 
decarbonised future:  
 The compelling mix of coincident critical minerals1 identified at surface 
underscores the Harts Range Project’s exploration potential  
o CCZ’s geology team just completed an inaugural field trip to the Harts Range 
Project as part of preliminary due diligence, noting the following:  
 Multiple outcropping pegmatites and field observations which appear to 
validate previous surface sampling work for critical minerals1; 
 There is an interpreted 12km corridor, which incorporates the five historical 
prospects, that is the primary exploration focus area; 
 The main objective of historical exploration was gemstones and vermiculite, 
which included only shallow (<60m) drilling1 – no drilling has been 
undertaken to test for Niobium, Uranium or Heavy Rare Earths;  
 
 
2 
 The NT’s Department of Minerals and Mining has confirmed there are no 
native title issues, but CCZ must continuously comply with the Code of 
Conduct for Mineral Explorers; and 
 Readily accessible most of the year via sealed roads then well-maintained 
tracks, with strong supportive mining infrastructure across the region  
o A systematic and rigorous exploration strategy is set to be devised for the Harts 
Range Project that should generate priority targets to test-drill:  
 Notably, this will include comprehensive surface sampling, geophysical 
surveys and collecting bulk samples for metallurgical testing 
o The Board will continue with previously announced plans to advance the NWQ 
Copper Project, possibly with a development partner, and sell the two remaining 
copper assets - BHA West Project (NSW) and Mkushi Project (Zambia)   
*** 
CASTILLO COPPER’S CHAIRMAN GED HALL COMMENTED: "The Board is confident its 
search for a transformational asset has been achieved with the Harts Range Niobium, Uranium 
and Heavy Rare Earth Project. This acquisition has compelling exploration potential that could 
enhance shareholder value materially, as development work gets underway. Moreover, this is 
especially apparent considering favourable global dynamics enabling several other ASX explorers 
in the niobium and uranium space to deliver successful ventures.”

HARTS RANGE NIOBIUM, URANIUM & HEAVY RARE EARTHS 
PROJECT  
Castillo Copper Ltd’s (ASX: CCZ) (“CCZ”) Board is delighted to announce it has entered into a 
binding agreement with Audax Holdings Pty Ltd (ACN: 678 403 864) to acquire 85% of the highly 
prospective Harts Range Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths Project via an earn-in 
arrangement (refer Deal Terms below).  
Across a 12km corridor, which includes five prospects – Cusp, Bobs, Bobs West, Thorium Anomaly 
and Niobium Anomaly – 28 assayed historical rock chips from outcropping pegmatites produced 
stellar grades up to grades up to 23.2% Nb, 12.7% U and 12.7% TREE including 2.85% Dy, 
0.32% Tb, 14.9% Ta1 (Figure 3). 
At the macro level, geopolitics and the energy transition are long term demand drivers for 
Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths which provides a compelling backdrop. As the tenure 
could host these critical minerals in economic quantities, the geology team will devise a 
comprehensive development campaign to fully assess the exploration potential.

Comprising two granted tenements (110km2), circa 120km north-east from Alice Springs, the 
project area is accessible for most of the year via a sealed highway and well-maintained tracks 
(Figure 3). Moreover, with the likes of ASX-listed Independence Group (ASX: IGO) having a 
substantial footprint in the region that flanks the Harts Range Project north, south and west2, the 
mining infrastructure and access to a talented labour pool is first rate (Figure 4).

FIVE PRIOIRTY PROSPECTS TO EXPLORE 
An overview of the five priority prospects, highlighting key attributes, within the 12km exploration 
focus corridor follows: 
Cusp Prospect 
As highlighted in Figure 1 above, the Cusp Prospect produced numerous high grade historical rock 
chips with the best results returning grades up to 23.2% Nb, 12.7% U and 14.6% TREE, 
including 1.88% Dy and 5.89% Ta1. 
 
 
 
 
5 
Notably, historical reports indicate that Niobium-Tantalum and Heavy Rare Earths were identified 
in pegmatites running circa east-west, up to 10m thick and over 70m long1. During the recent field 
trip (October 2024), CCZ’s geology team (including Non-executive Director Joel Logan) spent 
considerable time at the Cusp Project and were able to validate the historically reported pegmatite 
observation (Figures 5 & 6).

As no systematic follow up exploration has been undertaken, this will be a primary focus area to 
garner a greater understanding of the underlying geology for Niobium, Uranium and Heavy Rare 
Earths mineralisation.

Bobs and Bobs West Prospect 
The Bobs and Bobs West Prospects are located circa 1.5-2km along the same strike and to the 
west of the Cusp Prospect, exhibiting similar underlying mineralisation traits and geological 
settings1 (Figure 7).

As shown in Figure 9, the mineralisation in the pegmatites trends east-west, is several metres thick 
and over 30m long1.  
FIGURE 9: BOBS / BOBS WEST PROSPECTS – PEGMATITE ROCK CHIP SAMPLING

The Bobs West Prospect (200m west of Bobs Prospect) comprises an outcropping pegmatite along 
the same orientation, hosted exclusively within felsic gneiss of the Irindina Gneiss. Significantly, 
the pegmatite is semi-continuous for circa 300m, with similar geology to Bobs1. 
Further work needs to be undertaken on the Bobs and Bobs West Prospects to follow up on the 
encouraging historical results, especially for Niobium and Uranium.   
Niobium Anomaly Prospect 
At the Niobium Anomaly Prospect there is a differing geological variant with, high historical Niobium 
rock chip assay results up to 13,000ppm (1.3%) Nb, but low Uranium and Heavy Rare Earths 
readings1 (Figure 10).

Historically, the prospect was identified by elevated radiometric anomalies. The radiometric 
anomalies appear to correlate with intrusions of porphyritic granitoid and granitic gneiss1, which 
are geologically consistent with the pegmatites at Cusp, Bobs & Bobs West Prospects, warranting 
further investigation. 
Thorium Anomaly Prospect 
The Thorium Anomaly Prospect was previously located via airborne radiometric surveys which are 
low order (10-20x background) compared to the spot anomalies at Cusp, Bobs & Bobs West 
Prospects (50-200x background)1.  
The anomalies appear to correlate with intrusions of porphyritic granitoid and granitic gneiss, which 
are presumed to be geological features comparable to the pegmatites at Cusp, Bobs & Bobs West 
Prospects1; further investigative work is required. 
FAVOURABLE UNDERLYING GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURAL SETTING 
The Harts Range Niobium, Uranium-Heavy Rare Earth Project lies north-west of the Entia 
Dome (Figure 11) and is underlain by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-igneous 
Complex), which predominantly consists of feldspar-biotite-amphibole-garnet gneisses3. 
The Harts Range region has undergone repeated and substantial crustal re-working between 
Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times. As a result, it is now believed to represent an ancient and 
strongly altered/metamorphosed version of a continental collision zone3. 
Magnetotelluric data interpreted by a team consisting of Adelaide University and NTGS 
geologists (Selway et al, 2006)4 suggests the Entia Dome system is a deep-crustal feature 
that can be shown extending to the mantle.

APPENDIX A:  JORC CODE, 2012 EDITION – TABLE 1  
The following JORC Code (2012 Edition) Table 1 is primarily supplied to provide background for historical geological mapping, and rock chip sampling 
programs, mostly conducted by the Barfuss Corporation, from several prospects within the Harts Range Project over the last 15 years.  
No previous ASX releases have been made about the Harts Range Nb-U-REE Mineral Project. 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data  
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques  
• Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random 
chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, 
etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the 
broad meaning of sampling.  
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample 
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used.  
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are 
Material to the Public Report.  
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this 
would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling 
was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other 
cases, more explanation may be required, such as where 
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine 
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.  
• 
Surface samples were collected from approximately a 3m radius 
around the recorded coordinate location. The rock chip fragments 
that were collected to make up the sample included fragments 
that approximately ranged from 2-5cm and 0.2 - 3kg in weight.  A 
total of twenty-eight (28) rock chip samples were collected in 
calico bags and were progressed for laboratory analysis (sample 
numbers range from HR419 to 510). Samples were collected 
from rock outcrops, soils, and occasionally mullock heaps in the 
vicinity of west to east trending pegmatite dykes.  Many of the 
surface samples contained the U-bearing mineral samarskite.  
Drilling 
techniques  
• • Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, 
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (e.g. 
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
face sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if 
so, by what method, etc). 
• Not Applicable – no exploration drilling results as none were 
drilled. 
 
17 
 
Drill sample 
recovery  
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample 
recoveries and results assessed.  
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure 
representative nature of the samples.  
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and 
grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.  
• 
Not Applicable – no exploration drilling results as none were 
drilled. 
Logging  
• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and 
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support 
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies.  
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core 
(or costean, channel, etc) photography.  
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections 
logged.  
• Descriptions of the rock chip and soil samples are given in a 
table contained in Figure A1-1 of this CCZ’s ASX Announcement 
dated the 14TH of October 2024.  
• Where appropriate strike and dip measurements were taken at 
several sites, additional to the twenty (28) rock chip sample 
sites.  Measuring bedding is difficult because of the high 
metamorphically - disturbed rock types. 
Subsampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation  
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all 
core taken.  
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and 
whether sampled wet or dry.  
• For all sample types, the nature, quality, and appropriateness 
of the sample preparation technique.  
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling 
stages to maximise representivity of samples.  
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative 
of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results 
for field duplicate/second-half sampling.  
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the 
material being sampled.  
• 
Of the sample collected about 0.3-2kg of rock chip were 
presented for analyses. 
• 
Assays were done by independent laboratory Ultra Trace Pty 
Ltd at Canning Vale Perth WA (now Amdel Limited) throughout 
2007 and 2008. The samples were sorted and dried.  Primary 
preparation was then by crushing the whole sample. The whole 
sample was pulverised in a vibrating disc pulveriser. 
• 
All samples were initially crushed to 4 mm then pulverised to 75 
microns, with at least 85% passing through 75 microns. 
Standard sample preparation and analyses procedures were 
performed on all samples and are considered appropriate 
techniques. 
Quality of assay 
data and 
laboratory tests 
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and 
laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is 
considered partial or total. 
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF 
instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the 
analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, 
calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.  
Analytical Methods are described in detail as follows: 
Au, Pt, Pd 
• The samples have been analysed by firing a 40g (approx.) 
portion of the sample.  This is the classical fire assay process 
and will give total separation of Gold, Platinum, and Palladium 
in the sample. These have been determined by Inductively 
 
18 
 
• Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, 
blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether 
acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision 
have been established.   
Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry.  The sample(s) 
have been digested with a mixture of acids including 
Hydrofluoric, Nitric, Hydrochloric and Perchloric Acids. This 
digest approaches a total digest for many elements however 
some refractory oxides are not completely attacked. 
• The mineral Cassiterite is not efficiently attacked with this 
digest. 
• If Barium occurs as the Sulphate mineral, then at high levels 
(more than 4000 ppm) it may re-precipitate after the digest 
giving seriously low results.  Using this digest, some sulphur 
losses may occur if the samples contain high levels of sulphide. 
Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, P, Sc, V, Al, Ca, Na, K, S 
have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) 
Optical Emission Spectrometry. 
As, Ag, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ga, Li, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, W, Y, La, 
Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Th, U, 
Se, In, Te, Cs, Re, Tl 
• 
have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) 
Mass Spectrometry.  The samples have been fused with 
Sodium Peroxide and subsequently the melt has been 
dissolved in dilute Hydrochloric acid for analysis.  Because of 
the high furnace temperatures, volatile elements are lost. This 
procedure is particularly efficient for determination of Major 
element composition (Including Silica) in the samples or for the 
determination of refractory mineral species. 
B, Cr, Si, Fe, Mg, Ti 
• 
have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma 
(ICP) Optical Emission Spectrometry. 
Ge, Ta, Hf, Zr, Nb, Rb 
• 
have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) 
Mass Spectrometry. 
 
19 
 
• 
The assay results were in line with previous rock chip and 
drilling results obtained since 2006 at Harts Range. 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying  
• The verification of significant intersections by either 
independent or alternative company personnel.  
• The use of twinned holes.  
• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data 
verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.  
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data.  
• 
Independent Laboratory assaying by Ultra Trace has confirmed, 
within acceptable limits, the occurrences of high-grade Nb, U, 
and REE from the initial in field XRF readings. Laboratory 
standards and duplicates were used in accordance with 
standard procedures for geochemical assaying as noted below. 
• 
It has met the recommended insertion rates for the company 
QAQC controls (standards, blanks) with an overall insertion rate 
of 20%. However, no field duplicates were included in the three 
(3) batches and is recommended that 3% be included in future 
sampling programs. Summary of QAQC insertion rates. 
• 
Both the company standards and blanks were verified for 
elements Nb, U and Dy and returned results within 2 standard 
deviations (SD). Field duplicates are not present in the batch 
therefore were not reviewed.  
Location of data 
points  
• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes 
(collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and 
other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.  
• Specification of the grid system used.  
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control.  
• The spatial location for the rock chips and soils collected during 
the 2006 and 2007 fieldwork were collected by handheld GPS 
(-/+ 5m accuracy) [MGA94 Zone53]: The table of reported rock 
chip locations and descriptions are given in throughout the ASX 
release and in Figure A1-1 (at the end of the section). 
Data spacing and 
distribution  
• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.  
• Whether the data spacing, and distribution is sufficient to 
establish the degree of geological and grade continuity 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.  
• Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
• The Harts Range licenses lie north-west of the Entia Dome and 
are underlain by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-
igneous Complex), which predominantly consists of feldspar-
biotite-amphibole-garnet gneisses.  The Harts Range region at 
has undergone repeated and substantial crustal reworking 
between Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times and is now thought 
to represent an ancient and strongly altered/metamorphosed 
version of a continental collision zone. 
 
20 
 
• Most of the observed mineralisation is related to a swarm of 
west to east and southeast-trending pegmatite dykes, with an 
anomalous occurrence of the U-bearing mineral samarskite.  
• At the Cusp Prospect, niobium-HREE-Tantalum identified in 
pegmatites running approximately east-west, up to 10 metres 
thick and over 70 metres long. 
• At Bob’s Prospect niobium-HREE-Tantalum mineralisation in 
pegmatites trend east-west and is several metres thick and 
over 30 metres long, with similar geological setting to the Cusp 
Prospect. 
• 200m west of Bobs (Bobs West), outcropping pegmatite along 
the same orientation, hosted exclusively within felsic gneiss of 
the Irindina Gneiss. The pegmatite is semi-continuous for 
~300m with a similar geological setting and has notably large 
green muscovite flakes present. 
• The Niobium Anomaly Prospect is another variant with high 
Niobium results but low in rare earths and uranium. Elevated 
radiometrics located with the scintillometer recorded 1,300 cps 
within a small historic pit at the top of a knoll. Anomalies appear 
to correlate with intrusions of porphyritic “granitoid” and granitic 
gneiss, which are geologically consistent with the pegmatites 
mapped at Bob’s and the Cusp Prospects. 
• The Thorium Anomaly Prospect was previously located via 
airborne radiometric images. The radiometric anomalies are low 
order (10 to 20x background) compared to the spot anomalies 
at Bob’s and Cusp (50-200x background). Anomalies appear to 
correlate with intrusions of porphyritic “granitoid” and granitic 
gneiss, which presumably are geologically features like the 
pegmatites at Bob’s and the Cusp Prospects.  
Orientation of 
data in relation to 
geological 
structure  
• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased 
sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is 
known, considering the deposit type.  
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the 
orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have 
• In general, the strata of the area surrounding the pegmatite 
dykes in the Harts Range Meta-Igneous Complex dip steeply 
(>45 degrees) to the north and strike between east to 
southeast.  
 
21 
 
introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and 
reported if material.  
• Rock chip samples were taken at areas of interest from 
observed mineralisation along and across strike of the line of 
lode of the mineralised pegmatite dyke (very generally east 
west tends, secondary structures, surrounding spoil heaps, and 
across the four (4) anomalous areas originally identified in the 
planning stage.  
• However, no modern systematic exploration has been 
conducted, nor any of the mineralised prospects have ever 
been drilled. 
Sample security  
• The measures taken to ensure sample security.  
• The rock chip samples taken during the historical fieldwork 
were securely locked within the vehicle on site until delivered to 
Alice Springs by the field personnel for despatch to the 
laboratory (Ultra Trace in WA) by courier. 
Audits or reviews  
• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques 
and data.  
• The sampling techniques and the data generated from the 
laboratory assay results have been peer reviewed by consultant 
geologists independent of Castillo Copper Limited (Audax 
Resources and ROM Resources) familiar with the overall Harts 
Range Project and deemed to be acceptable.  
• No other external audits sampling techniques and data have yet 
been planned or undertaken.

Mineral 
tenement and 
land tenure 
status 
• Type, reference name/number, location and ownership 
including agreements or material issues with third parties 
such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, 
native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national 
park and environmental settings.  
• The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting 
along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to 
operate in the area. in the area.  
• The Harts Range Project lies in the south-east of the Northern 
Territory, roughly 120 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs.  Two 
granted tenements (EL 32046 and 32513) comprising a total 110 
km2 tenement package is located near essential infrastructure 
and accessible via the Plenty Highway. 
• A check on the tenures status was completed in the NTGS 
system ‘Strike’ on the 10 of October 2024, to validate the 
currentness of the exploration areas. All are current. 
• The region is serviced by excellent roads (Stuart Highway), train 
(the famous Ghan rail) and bus links connect the area. 
• Domestic and some international flights are available from Alice 
Springs (1 hour drive south of Harts Range) while all international 
flights are available direct from Darwin. 
• As a major regional centre, the town of Alice Springs provides 
public and private schools. There are churches, supermarkets, 
speciality shops, hotels, motels, cafés & restaurants, medical 
centres. 
• There is a professional police and emergency services presence 
throughout the area. Local professional and trade services 
support the community and the mining industry. Mobile phone and 
internet access are good.

Exploration 
done by other 
parties  
• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other 
parties.  
• Historical “Strike”-based mineral exploration reports have been 
reviewed for historical tenures that cover or partially cover the 
Project Area in this announcement. Federal and State 
Government reports supplement the historical mineral exploration 
reporting (QDEX open file exploration records). 
• Most explorers were searching for either Cu-Au-U, gemstones, or 
industrial minerals in the 1990’s, and proving satellite deposit 
style extensions to the several small subeconomic uranium or 
copper deposits. 
• The project is flanked by Independence Group (IGO) to the north, 
south and west. IGO is exploring for a raft of critical battery 
minerals. 
Geology  
• Deposit type, geological setting, and style of mineralisation.  
Regional Geology 
• The Harts Range Niobium, Uranium-Heavy Rare Earth Project 
lies north-west of the Entia Dome (Figure A2-1) and is underlain 
by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-igneous Complex), 
which predominantly consists of feldspar-biotite-amphibole-garnet 
gneisses. 
• The Harts Range region has undergone repeated and substantial 
crustal re-working between Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times. As 
a result, it is now believed to represent an ancient and strongly 
altered/metamorphosed version of a continental collision zone. 
• Magnetotellurics data interpreted by a team consisting of Adelaide 
University and NTGS geologists (Selway et al, 2006) suggests 
the Entia Dome system is a deep-crustal feature that can be 
shown extending to the mantle. 
• The below maps (Figures A2-2 and A2-3) show a traverse 
through the Arunta from north to south and skirted around the 
dome to the east and highlighting a major subduction zone to the 
north of the dome. The latter diagram shows the distribution of 
regional stratigraphic units.

Local Geology 
• The main rock types mapped and sampled at various REE 
Prospects include: 
o 
Biotite Schist/Granofels: brown-blackish biotite-rich rock; 
thin (5-10cm) poorly exposed zone on N side of ~6m 
thick unit/zone of similar rock (e.g. HR398, HR399 sites) 
(on N side of HR399). 
o 
Pegmatite, apatite-bearing: scree frags near W end of E-
W pegmatite, near intersection with north-south calcite 
vein; very coarse-grained feldspar-quartz with common 
coarse apatite - pale semi-translucent slightly greenish 
(rare honey-brown) blocky/tabular/hexagonal, some 
intergrown with feldspar/quartz. 
o 
Garnet-Cummingtonite rock: coarse-grained rock; with 
abundant interstitial pale greenish malachite-magnesite 
material; small patch of sub-crop amongst scree. 
 
28 
 
o 
Gneiss: weathered, moderately banded, fine-to-medium 
grained quartz-feldspar-hornblende-garnet; some 
coarser quartz-garnet rock; some brown haematite on 
fractures; sample below HR444. 
o 
Ultramafics: slightly weathered medium grained, 
greenish/brownish amphibole/olivine-dominated meta-
ultramafic. 
o 
Amphibolite: grey fine-grained hornblende -quartz rock; 
(approx. adjacent rough channel samples: HR461 (1m) 
above HR462 (3m) above HR463 (3m) above HR464 
(1m)). 
o 
Samarskite (or similar), being a dense brittle blackish 
lustrous radioactive mineral; cluster of 10+ fragments, 
most over 1cm (or broken weathered larger piece - ca. 5-
10 cm) in chalky white feldspar, beside weathered 
coarse mica beneath soil cover along southern side of 
quartz vein in a pegmatite core. 
Drillhole  
Information  
• A summary of all information material to the understanding 
of the exploration results including a tabulation of the 
following information for all Material drill holes: o easting 
and northing of the drill hole collar  
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above 
sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar  
o dip and azimuth of the hole o down hole length and 
interception depth o hole length.  
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis 
that the information is not Material and this exclusion does 
not detract from the understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the 
case.  
• Not Applicable – no exploration drilling results presented. 
Data 
aggregation 
methods  
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging 
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations 
(e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated.  
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of 
high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, 
• Independent Laboratory Assay results for the 28 rock chip 
samples from various Harts Range Prospects were averaged if 
more than one reading or determination was given. There was no 
cutting of high-grade REE results as they are directly relatable to 
 
29 
 
the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such aggregations should be 
shown in detail.  
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent 
values should be clearly stated.  
high grade mineralisation styles readily visible in the relevant 
samples.  
• There were no cut-off grades factored into any reporting of the 
laboratory assay results. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths  
• These relationships are particularly important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results.  
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill 
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.  
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are 
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect 
(e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’).  
• The 2006-7 rock chip and soil samples were taken at areas of 
interest from observed mineralisation along the line of lode of 
the mineralised pegmatite dyke, secondary structures, and 
surrounding spoil heaps.  Twenty-one (21) rock chip samples 
collected from rock faces and/or outcrops.  
• Eight (8) rock chip samples collected from stockpiles, shaft 
waste piles, and/or boulders of rock onsite. 
Diagrams  
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and 
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any 
significant discovery being reported These should include, 
but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations 
and appropriate sectional views.  
• Appropriate diagrams are presented in the body and the 
Appendices of the current ASX Release. Where scales are 
absent from the diagram, grids have been included and clearly 
labelled to act as a scale for distance.   
• Maps and Plans presented in the current ASX Release are in 
MGA94 Zone 53, Eastings (mN), and Northing (mN), unless 
clearly labelled otherwise. 
Balanced 
reporting  
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is 
not practicable, representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be practiced avoiding 
misleading reporting of Exploration Results.  
• Rock chip samples were taken at areas of interest from 
observed mineralisation along the line of lode of the mineralised 
pegmatite dyke, secondary structures, surrounding spoil heaps, 
and to the north and south of the line of lode to check the 
validity of the defined four (4) anomalous map areas.   
Other 
substantive 
exploration data 
• • Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should 
be reported including (but not limited to): geological 
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of 
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating substances.  
• The area is covered by regional airborne government and 
private radiometric, gravity, magnetic, and hyperspectral 
surveys. Unfortunately, other than the 2006 radiometric ground 
survey, no other ground surveys have been undertaken.  
• Substantial historical and current ground geochemical (stream 
sediment, soil, and rock chip samples have been undertaken 
and two episodes of shallow drilling, mostly for industrial 
 
30 
 
minerals (gemstones and vermiculite) by the owners of the 
leases, since 2006. 
Further work  
• The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests for 
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-
out drilling).  
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible 
extensions, including the main geological interpretations 
and future drilling areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive.  
o 
A future exploration strategy should encompass the 
following steps in subsequent field programs: 
o 
Reconnaissance mapping programs.  
o 
Close-spaced radiometric geophysical surveys. 
o 
Detailed mapping and rock chip sampling across 
prospects. 
o 
Regional soil sampling campaigns. 
o 
Mineral characterisation studies and petrological 
analysis. 
o 
Trenching and bulk sample test work. 
o 
Target generation and prioritisation; and 
o 
Exploratory drill-testing.
