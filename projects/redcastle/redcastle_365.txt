Strategic Tenement Acquisition
 
 
 
 
HIGHLIGHTS: 
• RC1 to increase its tenement footprint in the highly prospective Redcastle – 
Queen Alexandra gold corridor following the acquisition of P 39/6315. 
• Acquisition of P 39/6315 will provide access to new multiple exploration targets 
along a trend of historical workings. 
• Acquisition of P 39/6315 will enable broader and more comprehensive 
investigation of gold mineralisation controls within this historic gold corridor, 
consistent with RC1’s longer term strategy.   
 
Redcastle Resources Limited (“RC1” or “Company”) has entered into an agreement to acquire 
prospecting licence application P 39/6315.  Completion is dependent on normal industry 
conditions for the acquisition, including the following consideration: 
• 
Cash payment of $30,000 (ex GST); 
• 
2% gross revenue royalty, on all minerals, mineral products and concentrates, produced 
and sold from the Tenement; and  
• 
A “Detection Agreement” for the initial term of the Permit, granting the right to prospect 
for gold in the Permit in favour of the Vendors. 
P 39/6315 is a pending prospecting licence application and the agreed purchase is subject to the 
tenement being granted. 
Management Comment – The Board of Redcastle Resources Ltd: 
“Acquisition of P 39/6315, which adjoins current RC1 tenements, will provide an enlarged footprint 
in its highly prospective Redcastle – Queen Alexandra corridor, adding 187 ha to its already 1,088 
ha coverage.  Favourable exploration results to date on current RC1 tenements support historical 
sites potentially hosting significant untapped gold mineralisation and underpin RC1’s longer term 
strategy of acquiring additional interests.”  
REDCASTLE PROJECT 
The Redcastle Project is located ~58 kilometres east-southeast of the Gwalia Gold Mine in the 
highly prospective Leonora-Laverton area, an area delineated by multimillion ounce gold deposits 
hosted within the greenstone belt of the eastern Yilgarn (Figure 1).

P 39/6315 adjoins Redcastle prospecting licences P 39/5814 and P 39/5815. These contain the 
“West End”, “Conundrum” and “South Conundrum” targets (Figure 2). These targets have been 
actively explored by RC1 (Figure 2), and systematic auger soil geochemistry surveys reveal 
anomalous gold content extending up to the western boundaries of both licences, implying that 
they continue to the west and traverse P 39/6315.   
As related in RC1’s maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate at the Queen Alexandra Project 
area1 (located 2 km to the NE, Figure 2), gold mineralisation is typically hosted within a quartz 
veined, variably sheared gabbro and doleritic units. Although surface outcrop exposure within P 
39/6315 is limited, quartz veining is observed in these lithologies at several locations, such as 
shown in Figures 3, 4, & 5.

Following granting of P 39/6315 and completion of the acquisition, RC1 intends to: 
• 
Extend its surface auger sampling coverage across the permit 
• 
Complete detailed surface geological mapping and integrate these new, and historical, 
results into the Queen Alexandra – Redcastle corridor geological models.

• 
Plan an initial phase of drilling to confirm lateral continuity of key lithological units and 
structural controls to identify target areas, those most likely subject to preferential 
shearing, dilation and quartz associated mineralisation.   
NATIVE TITLE 
P39/6315 has completed the native title process as of 16 October 2024 through an expedited 
procedure, and the tenement is expected to be granted in due course.
