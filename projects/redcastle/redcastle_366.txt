PL6415 Laura Drilling
PL6415 extends over 310 m strike length by 160 m width and contains five quartz reefs with
extensive historic workings at surface (Figure 4), the principle being Laura (Figure 5). The historic
Laura mine was one of the more productive reefs mined in the north-western part of the Redcastle
goldfield. PL6415 is located wholly within the Redcastle JV EL5546 (Figures 1 and 2), held 70% by
Southern Cross Gold, in joint venture with Nagambie Resources Ltd (ASX:NAG).
The previous owners of Laura (Core Prospecting Pty Ltd and Starwest Ltd) drilled 16 holes for
1,923.2 m in 2019, in the vicinity of the old Laura mine. This work returned some narrow intervals of
high-grade gold and antimony, with significant results including:

Geophysical IP Chargeability Target
The Laura project also forms a key geophysical target within the Redcastle goldfield. Drilling to date
has been shallow (<135m vertical). Below the Laura drilling a 1.3 km-long coherent induced
polarization ("IP") chargeability anomaly generated by Mawson Victoria's 3D offset array IP
geophysical survey underlies the Laura PL6415 (Figure 6). This is considered highly prospective, as
there are at least 9 mined structures above the geophysical anomaly (5 within the Laura PL) where
the Welcome Group of mines reported to have extracted 20,583 oz at 254.6 g/t Au over 2 km strike
length down to a maximum depth of 125 m (in the period 1859 to 1865).
Context with Historic Mining at Redcastle
During the 1800's the average mining width was approximately 1 m on quartz veins with visible gold
(individual reef widths were less than 0.6 m). The length of workings combined is 17 km with several
reef systems extending for kilometres. Spurs off the main reef systems were recorded to have been
worked for distances between 15 m to 33 m. It is a characteristic of Redcastle that reefs are closely
spaced. On the western side of the field 14 reefs are recorded to occur in a cross-strike distance of

marginal to reefs in the country rock (wall-rock of quartz-vein structures) with shallow modern-day
reverse circulation drilling and trenching confirming that gold extends beyond these high-grade
quartz-vein structures. Beyond the high-grade visible gold in quartz-veins, additional targets included
vein stockworks in sandstones and dyke-hosted mineralization. The largest dyke was mined to a
depth of 27 m and was 11.5 m wide at 25 -120 g/t gold with 160 tonnes of ore extracted
suggesting the dyke may have been selectively mined, although the width of the dyke suggests
scope for a larger scale and lower grade target. Wider zones in stockworks (2.4 m to 4.8 m wide)
and breccia zones at Beautiful Venus have been recorded up to 20 m in width. Mineralization is
typically hosted in shear veins striking ~345-360° and dipping steeply westward, containing quartz,
carbonate, visible gold and antimony sulphide (stibnite). Surrounding the shear veins are a narrow <5
cm arsenopyrite and pyrite halo within the host rock which are weakly auriferous.
Context with Costerfield Mined Mineralization
Mandalay Resources' Costerfield mine and exploration leases are located 2 km south of SXG's
Redcastle JV EL5546. Costerfield is the target model sought at Redcastle. The Costerfield mine
corridor contains 2 million ounces of equivalent gold (pers. comm. Mandalay Q3 2021 Results).
Average drill hole widths and grades at Costerfield are: Brunswick lode (0.7 m @ 9.0 g/t Au and
4.0% Sb), Youle lode (0.4 m @ 47.7 g/t Au and 11.4% Sb), Kendal Splay (0.3 m @ 92.8 g/t Au and
41.3% Sb) and Peacock lode (0.4 m @ 13.0 g/t Au and 6.0% Sb). The average vein width at
Augusta is 0.3 m, while the Cuffley lode averaged 0.4 m. Average mined widths at Costerfield are
2.0 m (Mandalay Technical Report, 2021).
Commercial Terms
The Company purchased 100% of the Prospecting License PL6415 for cash consideration of
$300,000 from arm's length Core Prospecting Pty Ltd and Starwest Pty Ltd.
Sunday Creek Land Purchase
SXG already owns 132.64 hectare of freehold property that covers both the Sunday Creek project
drill area and areas for potential extension of the zone to the east. The new area lies adjacent to
both the main access and current freehold ownership at Sunday Creek. Freehold ownership secures
surface access and provides sufficient area for any potential future gold operation (Figure 1). The
Company acquired the 0.65 ha freehold for $366,240 and may also consider other uses for the
freehold land in the future, such as renewable energy options, livestock grazing or agistment to help
maintain the property (although there are no current plans for such additional uses). As the contract
was conditional upon satisfying the requirements of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act
1975 (Cth), a no objection notification for the freehold acquisition without conditions from the
Foreign Investment Review Board ("FIRB") was received before settlement
Further discussion and analysis of the Sunday Creek and Redcastle projects by Southern Cross Gold
is available on the SXG website at www.southerncrossgold.com.au
Figures 1 to 6 show project location, plan and longitudinal views, and the 3D IP chargeable anomaly

thickness.
Figure 7 shows the location of the new freehold land purchase at Sunday Creek.
Redcastle Joint Venture
A subsidiary of the Company, Mawson Victoria Pty Ltd, is party to an Option and Joint Venture
Agreement with Nagambie Resources Limited for the Redcastle Joint Venture tenements. Mawson
Victoria has met the obligations to achieve $1,000,000 of exploration commitments over a 5-year
period set under the Farm-in Agreements by 25 March 2025, and has earnt a 70% economic
interest Redcastle JV. A joint venture between the parties is now in the process of being formed.
Nagambie Resources Limited may contribute its 30% share of further exploration expenditures or, if
it chooses not to contribute, dilute its interest. Should Nagambie Resource Limited's interest be
reduced to less than 5%, it will be deemed to have forfeited its interest in the joint venture to the
Company in exchange for a 1.5% net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on gold revenue. Should
Nagambie Resources Limited be granted the NSR, the Company will have the right to acquire the
NSR for $4,000,000.

analyzed for gold using the fire assay technique (PE01S method; 25 gram charge), followed by
measuring the gold in solution with flame AAS equipment. Samples for multi-element analysis
(BM011 and over-range methods as required) use aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis. The
QA/QC program of Southern Cross Gold consists of the systematic insertion of certified standards of
known gold content, blanks within interpreted mineralized rock and quarter core duplicates. In
addition, On Site inserts blanks and standards into the analytical process.
MAW considers that both gold and antimony that are included in the gold equivalent calculation
("AuEq") have reasonable potential to be recovered at Redcastle, given current geochemical
understanding, historic production statistics and geologically analogous mining operations. MAW
considers that it is appropriate to adopt the same gold equivalent variables as Mandalay Resources
Ltd in its Mandalay Technical Report, 2022 dated 25 March 2022. The gold equivalence formula
used by Mandalay Resources was calculated using recoveries achieved at the Costerfield Property
Brunswick Processing Plant during 2020, using a gold price of US$1,700 per ounce, an antimony
price of US$8,500 per tonne and 2021 total year metal recoveries of 93% for gold and 95% for
antimony, and is as follows: 𝐴𝑢𝐸𝑞 = 𝐴𝑢 (𝑔/𝑡) + 1.58 × 𝑆𝑏 (%). MAW therefore considers that a 𝐴𝑢𝐸𝑞
= 𝐴𝑢 (𝑔/𝑡) + 1.58 × 𝑆𝑏 (%) is appropriate to use for the initial exploration targeting of gold-antimony
mineralization at Redcastle.
