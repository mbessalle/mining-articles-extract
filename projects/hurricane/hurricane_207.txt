Inca’s CEO, Trevor Benson commented: 
“Having carefully considered a number of acquisition proposals since I was appointed as CEO last year, it 
became abundantly clear that Stunalara was a standout opportunity. Its high-grade gold & gold-antimony 
Hurricane Project in NQ presents a unique opportunity to explore a project with multiple strongly 
mineralised veins which have historical workings but have never been drilled.” 
“In addition, the under explored Mt Reid project in Western Tasmania is located in an area where multiple 
significant precious and base metal deposits have been discovered, developed and mined over the last 100 
years.” 
ABOUT STUNALARA 
As shown below in Figure 1 Stunalara has three 100% owned exploration projects: 
1. The Hurricane Project is a high-grade gold & gold-antimony project located approximately 125 kms 
north-west of Cairns, in Queensland, Australia. The project consists of 3 granted exploration 
licences (EPM 27518; EPM 25855; EPM 19437) totaling 75.65 sq kms in the Hodgkinson Basin, east 
of the Great Dividing Range.  
2. Mt Read is located on the west coast of Tasmania, south of Macquarie Harbour, and consists of 
one granted exploration licence (EL04/2024) covering some 224km2. The project provides an 
opportunity for both Greenfields and Brownfields exploration and is prospective for nickel, copper, 
cobalt and gold. 
3. Western Australian Projects include Mulga Rocks (E28/3451), Boomerang Lakes (Application - 
ELA29/1264) and Ballard Central North (Application - ELA31/1387). These projects located north 
and north east of Kalgoorlie have uranium and gold potential.

Figure 1 – Location of Stunalara Projects 
The Hurricane Project in North Queensland 
The Hurricane Project is located in a gold rich province (Figure 2), though the project itself has been lightly 
explored. Hurricane sits in the Queensland Government’s New Economy Minerals Initiative Corridor 
(November 2019) and having been under-explored is an attractive area to apply modern exploration 
techniques. 
Importantly, Hurricane is centrally located within the northwest-southeast trending geological structures, 
which hosts numerous gold occurrences, including Anglo Saxon and Fine Gold Creek in the northwest, to 
the Belfast Hill and Leadingham gold occurrences in the southeast (Figure 2).  
Stunalara has a local team in place which allows for rapid execution of exploration programs.

Regional Geology 
The regional geology traverses a wide geological timescale from the Devonian in the Hodgkinson 
Formation through granodiorite and rhyolitic Carboniferous and Permian intrusions to Triassic and 
Quaternary Sandstones. The Hodgkinson Formation comprises dark grey to greenish, fine to medium 
quartz greywackes interbedded with siltstones, mudstones and conglomerates. The Carboniferous to 
Permian granitic, granodioritic and rhyolitic intrusions comprise a suite of felsic porphyritic intrusions. The 
main porphyritic bodies comprise medium to coarse-grained mineral crystals including subhedral to 
euhedral hornblende-biotite, k-feldspar and quartz, which locally grade into fine-grained silicified 
granites.  
Local Geology 
The three tenements which make up the Hurricane Project are structurally set within two major NW-SE 
trending faults, being the Hurricane Fault and the Retina Fault. The Hodgkinson Formation dominates 
these tenements and comprises of tightly folded greywackes, siltstones, shales, cherts, conglomerates 
and limestones. Locally within the Hurricane Project are 2 felsic intrusions, which occur in EPM 19437 and 
are predominantly porphyritic granites. These intrusions are the major source of heat, which mobilised 
hydrothermal fluids to interact with surrounding country rock leading to widespread alteration in the 
form of silicification, sericite and carbonates, and account for the deposition of gold, silver, and antimony 
mineralised veins. Mineralisation within the project area is associated with variably altered, silicified and 
brecciated quartz veins ranging in widths from 2 to >50m. The mineralogy of the Hurricane Project which 
includes gold, antimony, silver, +/- lead and zinc, leans towards the low sulfidation model.

Previous exploration activities over the project consisted mainly of geological mapping and rock chip 
sampling across the different prospects including Hurricane North, Hurricane South, Typhoon, Tornado, 
Cyclone, Monsoon, Holmes, and Bouncer, Figure 3. The rock chip sampling returned numerous high-grade 
gold and gold-antimony results (as set out below, in Table 1 and in in Appendix 1). Importantly despite 
the encouraging results there has been no exploration drilling to date. A typical example of a mineralised 
vein from the Hurricane prospect is shown in Figure 4. Locations of samples included in this report are 
spatially presented in Figure 5. 
Gold Prospects: 
Cyclone – 32 samples up to 4.9 g/t Au 
Cyclone North – 2 samples up to 7.4 g/t Au 
Monsoon – 24 samples up to 4.0 g/t Au 
Hurricane North - 80 samples up to 45.7 g/t Au 
Hurricane South – 35 samples up to 41.5 g/t Au 
Typhoon – 56 samples up to 71.6 g/t Au 
Tornado – 145 samples up to 17.6 g/t Au 
Gold-Antimony Prospects 
Bouncer South – 19 samples, Sb up to 20.8% & up to 7.9 g/t Au 
Holmes – 67 samples, Sb – up to 29.0% & up to 21.7 g/t Au

There was one recorded historical attempt to drill the Tornado Vein using a portable drilling machine with 
60cm long rods (4cm diameter). The hole was abandoned at 2.2m due to slow penetration rates and lack 
of water to keep the drilling machine operational, rendering the drilling ineffective. Due to the ineffective 
nature of the drilling no cross section has been provided. The drillhole was not surveyed as any deviation 
within a-2m interval would have had no material effect on the drill results. The resulting drill core was 
sawn in half and sampled at 0.5m intervals, giving 4 samples for the drillhole. Refer Appendix 2 for drillhole 
parameters and full results.

Mt Read Project – Tasmania  
The Project is located on the west coast of Tasmania, south of Macquarie Harbour, and consists of one 
exploration licence (EL04/2024) (Figure 6).  
This area is prolific in terms of world class geology, hosting several significant mines and discoveries, 
including Hellyer, Mt Lyell, Henty, Renison Bell, Roseberry and Avebury. 
Exploration efforts to date have largely focused on porphyry/intrusive-related copper-cobalt-gold 
mineralisation hosted within the Late Cambrian Mount Read Volcanics at the Thomas Creek Prospect, as 
well as Nickel-sulphide and platinum-group element mineralisation associated with middle Cambrian 
mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Hibbs Ultramafic Belt. Significant volcanic hosted massive sulphide 
(VHMS) and hybrid mineralisation potential also exists within Cambrian Mount Read Volcanic equivalent 
strata. The Mt Read project is hosted within the same geological package, which hosts major discoveries, 
including the world class Mt Lyell Cu-Au mine, the Avebury Nickle mine, the Henty gold mine, and the 
polymetallic (Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au) Hellyer mine, amongst others. 
Should the Bid be successful Inca’s initial focus will be on refining and reinterpretation of a recent EM 
Survey conducted over the entire exploration license, and generation of targets for drill testing.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data 
Criteria 
JORC Code Explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld 
XRF instruments, etc). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report.  
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling 
was used to obtain 1 m samples from 
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 
30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases 
more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or 
mineralisation types (eg submarine 
nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information. 
• Rock chip samples were collected in the field by the Placer 
Gold Ltd Geologist who followed a well- documented 
protocol and quality was considered to be of good industry 
standard. Samples were collected at random intervals 
from the Tornado, Typhoon, Monsoon, Cyclone and 
Hurricane quartz reefs and surrounding areas. 
• Rock chip samples were collected from surface 
outcrop and float along the targets. 
• All Rock Chip samples were photographed in place with a 
photo board indicating the date, lease number, sample 
number and geologist's name. 
• Approximate sample weights for each rock chip sample 
was recorded. 
Individual sample weights varied 
between 300 grams and several kilograms. 
• Each sample point was located using a hand-held GPS 
with +/-5m accuracy utilising MGA zone 55 (GDA94) 
coordinate system. 
• Placer Gold Ltd Geology collected a 60kg bulk sample 
from surface outcrop and float along the Tornado 
Vein. 
• Sanworth Pty Ltd collected nine rock chip samples from 
the Holmes Prospect. Their results are reported in 
Queensland GSQ Open data portal, report cr19844. 
Laboratory reports and maps have been cross-checked for 
accuracy and all data points plotted on the map to confirm 
locations of reported samples. 
• Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd collected rock chip vein 
samples from Typhoon (4), Pedersen (35), Hurricane North 
and South (18), Bouncer (35). Their results are reported in 
Queensland GSQ Open data portal, reports cr19824 and 
cr20231. Laboratory reports and maps have been cross- 
checked for accuracy. 
• Homestake completed local grid geological mapping over 
each of the identified veins and recorded the location of 
each sample point onto the maps. 
• The legend on the maps described the types of 
samples collected: quartz vein float, rock chip, 
composite soil BLEGS, etc. 
• Sample numbers, assay method, assay results, the width 
of sample cut as well as the assay results completed by the 
Umpire Laboratory were recorded onto the map. 
Drilling 
Techniques 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, 
open- hole hammer, rotary air blast, 
auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg 
core diameter, triple or standard tube, 
depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit 
or other type, whether core is oriented 
and if so, by what method, etc). 
 
Diamond drilling was attempted. A portable hand-held Shaw 
drilling machine with 40mm diameter rods and 600mm long 
rods was used to recover 2.2m of drill core that penetrated 
approximately 50% of the width of the Tornado Vein. Drilling 
was stopped due to the hard nature of the rock, the slow 
penetration rate and lack of water to keep the drilling 
machine operational.

Drill Sample 
Recovery 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative 
nature of the samples. 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse 
material. 
Drill core recovery appears to have been close to 98%. No 
apparent relation has been observed between sample 
recovery and grade. 
 
Logging 
Whether core and chip samples have 
been geologically and geotechnically 
logged to a level of detail to support 
appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies. 
Whether logging is qualitative or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography. 
The total length and percentage of the 
relevant intersections logged. 
A short geological description was recorded for the limited 
core that was drilled. The description was qualitative and 
included lithology, alteration and mineralisation. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and sample 
preparation 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken. 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube 
sampled, rotary split, etc and whether 
sampled wet or dry. 
For all sample types, the nature, quality 
and appropriateness of the sample 
preparation technique. 
Quality control procedures adopted for 
all sub-sampling stages to maximise 
representivity of samples. 
Measures taken to ensure that the 
sampling is representative of the in-situ 
material collected, including for instance 
results for field duplicate/second-half 
sampling. 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to 
the grain size of the material being 
sampled 
• Rock chip samples collected by Placer Gold ltd were 
sent to certified ALS Minerals Laboratory in Stafford, 
Brisbane, Queensland for sample preparation via an 
industry standard procedure. 
• Core was cut with a core saw and half of the core was 
sampled as 0.5m samples. These were then submitted 
for sample prep and assay at the ALS Laboratory in 
Townsville. The remaining half core was left behind for 
reference. 
• All submitted rock chips/core were crushed and 
pulverized. 
The 
resulting 
powders/pulps 
were 
dissolved by acid digestion and assayed by fire assay 
with AAS finish for Au and ICPMS for antimony and 
arsenic. 
• Rock chip samples collected by Homestake were 
submitted to Australian Assay Laboratories Group in 
Aitkenvale for sample preparation and lead fire assay. 
 
Quality of 
assay data 
and 
laboratory 
tests 
The nature, quality and appropriateness 
of the assaying and laboratory 
procedures used and whether the 
technique is considered partial or total. 
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, 
handheld XRF instruments, etc, the 
parameters used in determining the 
analysis including instrument make and 
model, reading times, calibrations factors 
applied and their derivation, etc. 
Nature of quality control procedures 
adopted (eg standards, blanks, 
duplicates, external laboratory checks) 
and whether acceptable levels of 
• The resulting pulp from samples prepared by ALS were 
assayed for Au using 30g fire assay AAS. 
• A four-acid digest (ME-MS61) was used for base metal 
multi-element geochemistry.  
• No blanks, duplicates or standards were inserted into 
the sample runs however the samples were collected at 
close intervals 
• ALS carry out internal check as per their standard 
operating procedure by running pulp duplicate analyses, 
standards (e.g., OREAS) and blanks to assess laboratory 
contamination and duplicate analyses to evaluate data 
repeatability and laboratory precision. 
• Placer Gold geological staff merged the laboratory assays 
into their sample database templates. 
• Homestake's rock chip vein samples were analysed by

accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision 
have been established. 
Australian Assay Laboratories Group by 50g fire assay 
(FA50/D610) with detection limits of 0.01ppm. The 
laboratory reports quote an accuracy of +/-15%. 
Verification 
of sampling 
and assaying 
The verification of significant 
intersections by either independent or 
alternative company personnel. 
The use of twinned holes. 
Documentation of primary data, data 
entry procedures, data verification, data 
storage (physical and electronic) 
protocols. 
Discuss any adjustment to assay data 
• Random checks were made to check the accuracy of 
assays reported in the Placer Gold database against ALS 
Laboratory reports. 
• Assay results for rock chip samples collected by Placer 
Gold from the quartz reefs at the Hurricane Project 
confirmed the range of rock chip sample assays reported 
by Homestake and Sanworth. 
• Primary data collected on paper logging sheets in the 
field were subsequently transferred to an electronic 
database. 
• Assay results were received from ALS in excel 
spreadsheet format and appended to in-house 
specifically designed Microsoft Excel database. 
• Rock chip samples collected by Homestake that returned 
anomalous Au grades, were resubmitted to an Umpire 
Laboratory, Classic Comlabs for independent analyses. 
Assay results reported by the Umpire Laboratory 
confirmed the anomalous results obtained by Australian 
Assay Laboratories Group. 
Location of 
data points 
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to 
locate drill holes (collar and downhole 
surveys), trenches, mine workings and 
other locations used in Mineral Resource 
estimation. 
Specification of the grid system used. 
Quality and adequacy of topographic 
control. 
• Placer Gold used a handheld GPS was used to record the 
location of every rock chip sample collected. 
• The grid system used is GDA94 Z55. 
• The single 2m hole that was drilled was also geo-referenced 
using a handheld GPS. 
• No topographic surveys were carried out by Placer Gold. 
• Topographic maps from the Department of Natural 
Resources, Mines and Energy were downloaded from the 
www.dnrme.qld.go.au website and used as a reference to 
crosscheck elevation date read by the GPS. 
• Homestake completed local grid geological mapping over 
each of the identified veins and recorded the location of 
each sample point onto the maps. Sample numbers, assay 
method, assay results as well as the assay results 
completed by the Umpire Laboratory were recorded onto 
the map. 
Data spacing 
and 
distribution 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
Whether the data spacing and 
distribution is sufficient to establish the 
degree of geological and grade continuity 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and 
Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and 
classifications applied. 
Whether sample compositing has been 
applied 
• Surface rock chip s amples were collected at 20 to 30m 
intervals along the outcropping reefs and quartz veins. 
• The data collected to date confirms the geological 
continuity of each reef. 
• Further sampling and drilling are needed to confirm 
and evaluate grade continuity along each of the 
identified reefs. 
 
Orientation 
of data in 
relation to 
geological 
structure 
Whether the orientation of sampling 
achieves unbiased sampling of possible 
structures and the extent to which this is 
known, considering the deposit type. 
If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to 
have introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if 
material. 
Samples were collected along defined geological structures of 
interest, being altered and brecciated quartz veins. Sampling 
was carefully done to ensure that there was no bias by 
ensuring that each sample fully represented the alteration and 
geological variability of each sampling station. 
 
The lone drillhole was oriented north to azimuth 000 and 
drilled at -35 dip.

Sample 
security 
The measures taken to ensure sample 
security 
All samples taken by the Geologist were either directly 
delivered to Toll lpec, Cairns, which shipped them to ALS 
laboratory in Brisbane or were personally delivered by car to 
the ALS laboratory. 
Audits or 
reviews 
The results of any audits or reviews of 
sampling techniques and data. 
GPS data was audited and reviewed, and all errors were 
removed. Only 4 out of 580 points had errors that were 
fixed.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (eg cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are 
usually Material and should be 
stated. 
Where aggregate intercepts 
incorporate short lengths of high-
grade results and longer lengths of 
low-grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should 
be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations 
should be shown in detail. 
The assumptions used for any 
reporting of metal equivalent 
values should be clearly stated. 
All reported results are for individual samples. No data aggregation 
was applied. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
If the geometry of the 
mineralisation with respect to the 
drill hole angle is known, its nature 
should be reported. 
If it is not known and only the down 
hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this 
effect (eg ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
Reported results are for individual rock chip samples/drill core. Each 
rock chip sample was collected from the surface and was fully 
representative of each sample point

tenements. No other available information has been omitted from 
this report. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
Other exploration data, if 
meaningful and material, should be 
reported including (but not limited 
to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk 
samples – size and method of 
treatment; metallurgical test 
results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential 
deleterious or contaminating 
substances. 
Everything meaningful and material is disclosed in the body of the

areas of possible extensions, 
including the main geological 
interpretations and future drilling

not commercially sensitive. 
The first phase of work by Inca Minerals will be to verify the 
historical results reported in this announcement. This will be done 
by direct field visits and sampling of the reported mineralised veins 
to determine whether the new data matches the historical datasets 
in this announcement. 
Once the new data has been verified and reconciled with historic 
rock chip data, all geochemical will then be collated to identify 
sampling gaps that need infill sampling.   
Results from geochemical sampling and mapping programs will be 
synthesised to prioritise veins that require additional intensive 
sampling and mapping to determine their potential to host 
significant concentrations of gold and/or gold-antimony bearing 
minerals. All prospects that present significance for large-tonnage 
gold/antimony and any other mineralisation will be drilled to assess 
depth continuity and geometry.

to the extent that they were on foot prior to the date of this agreement.  
6.2 
No-shop and no talk 
During the Exclusivity Period, Stunalara must not, and must ensure that each of its Related 
Persons do not, directly or indirectly: 
(a) 
(no shop) solicit, invite, encourage or initiate (including by the provision of non-
public information to any Third Party) any inquiry, expression of interest, offer, 
proposal or discussion by any person in relation to, or which would reasonably be

3472-08/2410417_1 
 
17 
6.3 
Fiduciary exception 
Clause 6.2(b) does not prohibit any action or inaction by Stunalara or any of its Related 
Persons in relation to any actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal, which the 
Stunalara Board acting in good faith determines, having regard to written advice from its 
external Advisers, is a Superior Proposal (or which may reasonably be expected to result in 
the Competing Proposal becoming a Superior Proposal) and the failure to take or not take 
such action would constitute, or would be likely to constitute, a breach of the fiduciary or 
statutory duties of the directors of Stunalara, provided that the actual, proposed or 
potential Competing Proposal was not directly or indirectly brought about by, or facilitated 
by, a breach of clause 6.2. 
6.4 
Notice of approach  
(a) 
During the Exclusivity Period, Stunalara must as soon as possible (and in any event 
within 24 hours) notify Inca in writing if it or any of its Related Persons becomes 
aware of any:  
(i) 
negotiations or discussions, approach or attempt to initiate any 
negotiations or discussions, or intention to make such an approach or 
attempt to initiate any negotiations or discussions in respect of any 
inquiry, expression of interest, offer, proposal or discussion in relation to 
an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal; 
(ii) 
proposal made to Stunalara or any of its Related Persons, in connection 
with, or in respect of any exploration or completion of, an actual, 
proposed, or potential Competing Proposal; or 
(iii) 
provision by Stunalara or any of its Related Persons of any non-public 
information concerning the business or operations of Stunalara or the 
Stunalara Group to any a Third Party (other than a Regulatory Authority) 
in connection with an actual, proposed or potential Competing 
Proposal, 
whether direct or indirect, solicited or unsolicited, and in writing or otherwise 
unless (and only to the extent that) the Stunalara Board, acting in good faith and 
having regard to external legal advice, determines that it would be a breach of 
their fiduciary or statutory duties to notify Inca.  
(b) 
A notification given under clause 6.4(a) must include a summary of all material 
terms and conditions of the relevant actual, proposed or potential Competing 
Proposal (and the identity of the party making or proposing the relevant actual, 
proposed or potential Competing Proposal if such disclosure is not prohibited by 
the Competing Proposal)) unless (and only to the extent that) the Stunalara 
Board, acting in good faith and having regard to external legal advice, 
determines that it would be, or would likely be, a breach of their fiduciary or 
statutory duties to notify Inca.  
(c) 
Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to in clause 6.4(a), 
Stunalara must as soon as possible advise Inca of any material developments in 
relation to an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal, including 
material amendments or proposed amendments to the terms of such actual, 
proposed or potential Competing Proposal, and advise Inca of the timing of any 
board meeting to consider that proposal unless (and only to the extent that) the 
Stunalara Board, acting in good faith and having regard to external legal advice, 
determines that it would be a breach of their fiduciary or statutory duties to notify 
Inca. 
6.5 
Matching right 
(a) 
Without limiting clause 6.2, during the Exclusivity Period, Stunalara:  
 
3472-08/2410417_1 
 
18 
(i) 
must not enter into any legally binding agreement, arrangement or 
understanding (whether or not in writing) pursuant to which a Third 
Party, Stunalara or both proposes or propose to undertake or give effect 
to an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal; and 
(ii) 
must procure that none of its directors change their recommendation 
of the Takeover Bid or publicly recommend an actual, proposed or 
potential Competing Proposal or recommend against the Takeover Bid 
(provided that a statement that no action should be taken by Stunalara 
Shareholders pending the assessment of a Competing Proposal by the 
Stunalara Board and its advisers shall not contravene this clause),  
unless: 
(iii) 
the Stunalara Board acting in good faith and in order to satisfy what the 
members of the Stunalara Board consider to be their statutory or 
fiduciary duties (having received written advice from its external 
financial and legal advisers) determines that the Competing Proposal 
would be or would be likely to be an actual, proposed or potential 
Superior Proposal;  
(iv) 
Stunalara has complied with clause 6.4(b); 
(v) 
Stunalara has given Inca at least 5 Business Days after the date of the 
provision of the information referred to in clause 6.4(b) to provide a 
matching or superior proposal to the terms of the actual, proposed or 
potential Competing Proposal; and 
(vi) 
Inca has not announced or otherwise formally proposed to Stunalara a 
matching or superior proposal to the terms of the actual, proposed or 
potential Competing Proposal by the expiry of the 5 Business Day period 
in clause 6.5(a)(v) above. 
(b) 
If Inca proposes to Stunalara, or announces, amendments to the terms of the 
Takeover Bid including increasing the amount of consideration offered under the 
Offer or a new proposal that constitutes a matching or superior proposal to the 
terms 
of 
the 
actual, 
proposed 
or 
potential 
Competing 
Proposal 
(Counterproposal) by the expiry of the 5 Business Day period in clause 6.5(a)(v) 
above, Stunalara must procure that the Stunalara Board considers the 
Counterproposal and if the Stunalara Board, acting reasonably and in good 
faith, determines that the Counterproposal (as completed) would provide an 
equivalent or superior outcome for Stunalara Shareholders as a whole compared 
with the Competing Proposal, then Stunalara and Inca must use their best 
endeavours to agree the amendments to this agreement that are reasonably 
necessary 
to 
reflect 
the 
Counterproposal 
and 
to 
implement 
the 
Counterproposal, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable, and Stunalara 
must procure that each of the Stunalara Directors continue to recommend the 
Takeover Bid (as modified by the Counterproposal) to Stunalara Shareholders.  
6.6 
Cease discussions 
Stunalara must, and must procure that its Related Bodies Corporate, cease any discussions 
or negotiations existing as at the date of this agreement relating to: 
(a) 
any actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal; or 
(b) 
any transaction that would, or would reasonably be expected to, reduce the 
likelihood of success of the Takeover Bid, 
provided that nothing in this clause 6.6 will require Stunalara to cease any discussions or 
negotiations with respect to an Excluded Arrangement. 
 
3472-08/2410417_1 
 
19 
6.7 
Provision of information by Stunalara 
(a) 
Subject to clause 6.7(b), during the Exclusivity Period, Stunalara must as soon as 
possible provide Inca with: 
(i) 
in the case of written materials, a copy of; and 
(ii) 
in any other case, a written statement of, 
any material non-public information about the business or affairs of Stunalara or 
the Stunalara Group disclosed or otherwise provided to any Third Party in 
connection with an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal that has 
not previously been provided to Inca.  
(b) 
Stunalara will not, and will procure that none of its Related Persons provide any 
information to a Third Party in relation to an actual, proposed or potential 
Competing Proposal, unless: 
(i) 
permitted by clause 6.3; and 
(ii) 
that Third Party has entered into a confidentiality agreement with 
Stunalara on customary terms. 
6.8 
Compliance with law 
(a) 
If it is finally determined by a court, or the Takeovers Panel, that the agreement 
by the parties under this clause 6 or any part of it: 
(i) 
constituted, or constitutes, or would constitute, a breach of the fiduciary 
or statutory duties of the Stunalara Board;  
(ii) 
constituted, or constitutes, or would constitute, ‘unacceptable 
circumstances’ within the meaning of the Corporations Act; or 
(iii) 
was, or is, or would be, unlawful for any other reason, 
then, to that extent (and only to that extent) Stunalara will not be obliged to 
comply with that provision of clause 6.  
(b) 
The parties must not make or cause to be made, any application to a court or 
the Takeovers Panel for or in relation to a determination referred to in this 
clause 6.8. 
7. 
REIMBURSEMENT FEE 
7.1 
Background to Reimbursement Fee 
(a) 
Each party acknowledges that, if they enter into this agreement and the 
Takeover Bid is subsequently not implemented, the parties will incur significant 
costs, including those set out in clause 7.4. 
(b) 
In these circumstances, the parties have agreed that provision be made for the 
payment outlined in this clause 7, without which the parties would not have 
entered into this agreement or otherwise agreed to implement the Takeover Bid. 
(c) 
Stunalara and the Stunalara Board believe, having taken advice from its external 
legal adviser, that the implementation of the Takeover Bid will provide benefits to 
it and its shareholders, and that it is reasonable and appropriate that Stunalara 
agrees to the payments referred to in clause 7.2 in order to secure Inca's 
participation in the Takeover Bid. 
 
3472-08/2410417_1 
 
20 
7.2 
Triggers for payment of Reimbursement Fee by Stunalara 
Subject to clauses 7.5 and 7.7, Stunalara must pay the Reimbursement Fee to Inca without 
set-off or withholding, if: 
(a) 
during the Exclusivity Period, any one or more members of the Stunalara Board 
withdraws, adversely revises or adversely qualifies his or her support of the 
Takeover Bid or his or her recommendation that Stunalara Shareholders accept 
the Offer or fails to recommend that Stunalara Shareholders accept the Takeover 
Bid, or, having made such a recommendation, withdraws, adversely revises or 
adversely qualifies that recommendation for any reason other than because the 
Independent Expert concludes in its Independent Expert’s Report that the Offer 
is not fair and not reasonable;  
(b) 
during the Exclusivity Period, any one or more members of the Stunalara Board 
recommends that Stunalara Shareholders accept or vote in favour of, or 
otherwise supports or endorses (including support by way of accepting or voting, 
or by way of stating an intention to accept or vote, in respect of any Stunalara 
Shares held or controlled by them or held on their behalf), a Competing Proposal 
of any kind that is announced (whether or not such proposal is stated to be 
subject to any pre-conditions) during the Exclusivity Period; or 
(c) 
Inca has terminated this agreement pursuant to clause 9.1(a), 9.1(c) or 9.2(b).  
7.3 
Timing of payment of Reimbursement Fee 
(a) 
A demand by Inca for payment of the Reimbursement Fee under clause 7.2 must: 
(i) 
be in writing; 
(ii) 
be made after the occurrence of the event in that clause giving rise to 
the right to payment; 
(iii) 
state the circumstances which give rise to the demand; and 
(iv) 
nominate an account into which Stunalara is to pay the Reimbursement 
Fee, 
and may only be made after the End Date and provided that Inca has not 
become the registered legal and beneficial holder of at least 50.1% of Stunalara 
Shares.  
(b) 
Subject to clause 7.7, Stunalara must pay the Reimbursement Fee into the 
account nominated by Inca, without set-off or withholding, within 21 Business 
Days after receiving a demand for payment where Inca is entitled under 
clause 7.2 to the Reimbursement Fee. 
7.4 
Basis of Reimbursement Fee 
The amount payable by Stunalara pursuant to clause 7.2 is purely and strictly 
compensatory in nature and has been calculated to reimburse Inca for costs including the 
following: 
(a) 
fees for legal, financial and other professional advice in planning and 
implementing the Takeover Bid (excluding success fees); 
(b) 
reasonable opportunity costs incurred in engaging in the Takeover Bid or in not 
engaging in other alternative or strategic initiatives; 
(c) 
costs of management and directors’ time in planning, considering and 
implementing the Takeover Bid; and 
 
3472-08/2410417_1 
 
21 
(d) 
out of pocket expenses incurred by Inca's employees, advisers and agents in 
planning, considering and implementing the Takeover Bid, 
and the parties agree that: 
(e) 
the costs actually incurred will be of such a nature that they cannot all be 
accurately ascertained; and 
(f) 
the amount payable is a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of those costs,  
and each party represents and warrants that it has received advice from its external legal 
adviser on the operation of this clause 7. 
7.5 
Compliance with law 
This clause 7 does not impose an obligation on Stunalara to pay the Reimbursement Fee 
to the extent (and only to the extent) that the obligation to pay the Reimbursement Fee: 
(a) 
is declared by the Takeovers Panel to constitute ‘unacceptable circumstances’; 
or 
(b) 
is determined to be unenforceable or unlawful by a court, 
provided that, in either case, all lawful avenues of appeal and review, judicial and 
otherwise, have been exhausted. For the avoidance of doubt, any part of the 
Reimbursement Fee that would not constitute unacceptable circumstances or that is not 
unenforceable or unlawful (as applicable) must be paid by Stunalara. To the extent that 
the Reimbursement Fee has already been paid, Inca must refund the relevant portion of 
the Reimbursement Fee paid under this agreement within 5 Business Days of receipt of a 
demand for refund. 
7.6 
Reimbursement Fee payable only once 
Where the Reimbursement Fee becomes payable to Inca under clause 7.2 and is actually 
paid, Inca cannot make any claim against the other party for payment of any subsequent 
Reimbursement Fee. 
7.7 
Limitation of liability 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, except in relation to a wilful or 
intentional breach of or non-compliance with any provision of this agreement by 
Stunalara: 
(a) 
the maximum liability of a party to all other parties under or in connection with 
this agreement including in respect of any breach of this agreement will be the 
Reimbursement Fee; 
(b) 
a payment by a party in accordance with this clause 7 represents the sole and 
absolute liability of that party under or in connection with this agreement and no 
further damages, fees, expenses or reimbursements of any kind will be payable 
by that party in connection with this agreement; and 
(c) 
the amount of the Reimbursement Fee paid to the recipient under this clause 7 
shall be reduced by the amount of any loss or damage recovered by any other 
party in relation to a breach of this agreement.
