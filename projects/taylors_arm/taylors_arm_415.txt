ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 20 September 2024
TRIGG ACQUIRES ULTRA HIGH-GRADE ANTIMONY PORTFOLIO,
GRADING UP TO 63% ANTIMONY
HIGHLIGHTS
• Trigg signs a binding purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the Spartan and Taylors Arm
Antimony projects in northern NSW after completing due diligence. The projects are in the New
England Orogen and are considered highly prospective for antimony ± gold mineralisation.
• Taylors Arm Antimony Portfolio features 71 historical workings on granted EL have produced
ultra- high-grade antimony. The portfolio includes:
▪ Swallows Nest Mine – extracted antimony from 1940 to 1955 at a 40% antimony (Sb)
concentration and 30% Sb on reopening in 1972. Recent rock samples revealed extremely
high-grade antimony mineralisation with grades of 29.8% Sb and 31.4% Sb1.
▪ Testers Mine – featured massive stibnite veins grading up to 63% Sb, Australia's highest-
recorded antimony grade.
▪ Little Purgatory Mine – stockpile samples produced antimony with grades up to 27.7% Sb.
▪ Real McKay Mine – recent exploration identified a stibnite-bearing fault breccia hosting
high-grade antimony mineralisation, reporting 15.2% Sb and 52.7% Sb.
▪ Taylors Arm Portfolio contains various other historical workings/prospects with antimony
grades up to 20.6% Sb (Walfords Claim), 27.5% Sb (Neil & Taylors Prospect), 18.3% Sb
(Bowraville), and 17.7% Sb (Kia Ore Mine).
• Spartan Antimony Project – immediately adjacent to Larvotto Resources' (ASX: LRV) licences
containing its Hillgrove Antimony-Gold operation, covering parts of the Hillgrove Fault and the
same rocks that host the Hillgrove deposit.
• Antimony prices are trading at all-time highs following China’s export ban on some antimony
products from 15 September 2024.
• Antimony is on the Critical Mineral lists of countries, including Australia, the USA, Canada, Japan
and the EU2 due to its defence and military applications.
• Trigg has an established exploration team and is funded to commence exploration activities
immediately.
Trigg Minerals Limited (ASX: TMG) ("Trigg" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a
binding purchase agreement with Bullseye Gold Pty Ltd to acquire the ultra-high-grade Taylors Arm
and Spartan Antimony Projects in northern NSW (Acquisition) (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Locations of the Taylors Arm and Spartan antimony projects in northern NSW.
The Spartan Project covers parts of the Hillgrove Fault and the same rocks that host the adjacent
Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Mining Operations, owned by Larvotto Resources (ASX: LVR).
The Taylors Arm Project includes Swallows Nest, Munga Creek, and Testers Mines, which have recently
produced antimony. The latter features massive stibnite veins grading up to 63% Sb (Table 1),
Australia's highest-recorded antimony grade.
The projects comprise one granted tenement (EL 9668—Taylors Arm) and one pending tenement
application (ELA 6801—Spartan) across 288km2 of the New England Orogen.
Trigg Minerals Executive Chair Timothy Morrison said, "Trigg's acquisition of ultra-high-grade
antimony assets in NSW represents a transformative transaction for the Company, significantly
enhancing its strategic resource portfolio. The move into the antimony space positions Trigg to
capitalise on the growing demand for the critical mineral and strengthens our market presence. We
can achieve a strong foundation for future growth and profitability with successful exploration."

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Trigg signed a binding purchase agreement with Bullseye Gold Pty Ltd to acquire a 100% interest in
one granted tenement and one exploration application in the New England Orogen in northern NSW.
The application (ELA 6801) lies immediately adjacent to Larvotto's Hillgrove Antimony-Gold
Operations, Australia's largest known antimony deposit. It lies on the same rocks and covers parts of
the same mineralised structure that hosts parts of the Hillgrove Mining Operations.
Figure 2: Taylors Arm tenements with historical mineral occurrences and geology.
The granted title (EL 9668) covers 71 historical workings in six mineral camps, including Taylors Arm,
from which the project is named, Munga Creek, Toorooka, Pinnacles, Mistake Creek and Purgatory
(Figure 2). Many of these camps report high-grade breccia material (with grades exceeding 25% Sb).
The widespread occurrence of stibnite (Sb S ), the principal ore for antimony, indicates that the

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 20 September 2024
geology is prospective for primary stibnite mineralisation or polymetallic ore or gold-antimony
association such as Hillgrove (~75km NW of this location).
Host rocks for the quartz-stibnite breccia veins are predominantly Permian-aged metasediments of
the Nambucca Beds in the north and Kempsey Beds in the south. The Munga Creek Mine last operated
in 1974, producing more than 1,100t of antimony concentrates.3
The Swallow Creek Mine extracted antimony from 1940 to 1955 at a concentration of 40% Sb and
returned 30% Sb on reopening in 1972.
The Purgatory Mine produced 1229t at a grade of 42.27% Sb between 1935 and 1954.
More recently, prospecting at the Bradleys Mine has indicated the presence of significant antimony
mineralisation.
The antimony occurrences of Taylors Arm are structurally controlled by fault, shear and fracture
systems.
The Taylors Arm project saw antimony production during two crucial periods: World War II and the
early 1970s. This production yielded economically significant grades of the metal. Despite the
widespread nature of these antimony occurrences, exploration efforts have mainly focused on these
previously identified zones. There has been no modern, systematic exploration since at least the
1990s. Trigg aims to broaden its scope by exploring the potential for larger-scale deposits across one
or more of these occurrences. The goal is to unlock further economic value from this historically
productive region.

Department's Mineral Resources Land Information System (MRLIS), an integrated relational database
that permits graphic and text inquiries about mineral deposits, geology, mining and exploration titles.
The listed location information (Table 1; AMG84) refers to the site of a historical working, not the
sample collection point. The exact sample location isn't specified but is described in relation to the
historical working. For example, samples were collected within or near the working, such as from a
nearby mullock dump. Trigg confirms that a geologist from the NSW Geological Survey conducted the
sampling to characterise the identified mineralisation at each historical working. Each historical
working discussed is confirmed to be located within either the northern or southern blocks (partitions)
of EL 9668.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The Company is fully committed to engaging with local communities and ensuring all fieldwork is
conducted with the highest environmental best practice standards. Trigg recognises the importance
of building strong, respectful relationships with stakeholders and will prioritise transparent
communication, collaboration, and sustainable development.
Trigg's operations will adhere to a rigorous code of environmental responsibility, minimising impact
on the land and promoting long-term stewardship as the Company works towards shared goals of
progress and environmental protection.
ANTIMONY MARKET OVERVIEW
The global antimony market is experiencing significant disruption and opportunity following China's
decision to impose export controls on antimony ore, metal, oxides, and related smelting technologies,
effective 15 September 2024. As the world's largest producer, supplying nearly 50% of global output,
China's move has tightened supply, driving prices to recent highs of $24,500 per metric tonne4This
action is expected to increase market volatility and further emphasise antimony's strategic
importance. Due to the risks of supply concentration, major economies, including Australia, the UK,
the EU, the US, and Japan, have classified antimony as a critical mineral.
Antimony's diverse applications cover key industries, including flame retardants, lead-acid batteries,
glass manufacturing, and ammunition alloys. Its strategic role extends to military technologies like
infrared missile guidance systems, night vision equipment, and nuclear weapons, underscoring its
importance in national security.
The antimony market is primed for growth, driven by rising demand in critical sectors. Its use in
photovoltaic solar cells enhances solar panel efficiency, aligning with the global shift toward
renewable energy. Stricter fire safety regulations fuel increased consumption of antimony-based
flame retardants, while the expanding electric vehicle market highlights its importance in advanced
battery technologies.
As global recognition of antimony’s value grows, its market will expand, reinforcing its status as a
critical commodity for emerging technologies and essential industrial applications.
