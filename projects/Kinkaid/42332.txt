# Romios Stakes New Claims at the Kinkaid Copper-Gold-Silver Property in the Walker Lane Trend, Nevada, USA

Discovers High-Grade Copper Boulder-Train With Assays up to 13.3% Cu and Possible Porphyry Type Alteration Nearby

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - October 12, 2023) - **Romios Gold Resources Inc. (TSXV: RG) (OTCQB: RMIOF) (FSE: D4R) ("Romios Gold" or the "Company")** is pleased to report that it has discovered a train of mineralized boulders with high-grade copper +/- gold values in an area adjacent to the Company's Kinkaid project in the Walker Lane trend of southern Nevada. Sixteen new claims have been staked to cover the probable source area of these boulders as well as six more claims over old workings at another site.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

  * Nine mineralized boulders were sampled along a 300-metre-long stretch of a dry stream bed. Copper values range from **0.73% to 13.3% Cu, and average 5.03% Cu**(see Photo #1, Table 1). 
  * One of the nine samples consists largely of magnetite, a common component of veins in many porphyry copper and skarn systems, and this sample assayed **12.7 g/t Au.** The remaining eight samples assayed **0.08 to 2.49 g/t Au and average 0.94 g/t Au.**
  * The mineralized samples were first located near several outcrops of locally pyritic basalt and numerous large boulders with strong epidote alteration very similar to that seen in many porphyry copper and/or skarn alteration zones (see Photo #2).
  * The upstream limit of the mineralized boulders located to date is coincident with a >300 m wide sericite anomaly, visible on Short Wave Infrared satellite imagery, which may be reflective of alteration associated with the mineralized system. 
  * Several of the samples also contain unusually high levels of vanadium (up to 685 ppm V) and uranium (up to 402 ppm U).



"This latest discovery of a very high-grade Cu-Au boulder train adjacent to apparent porphyry-type alteration is a major step forward for the Kinkaid project," stated John Biczok, VP, Exploration. "There is already one suspected buried porphyry system on the original Kinkaid claims as well as a group of skarn deposits thought to overlie another magmatic system (See Romios Press Releases [June 16, 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/4QvzYikzwX) & [July 31, 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jpBPNiAJ0p)). The combination of numerous copper-rich boulders and the nearby porphyry-style alteration suggests that we may have a significant target close to surface on these new claims."

A follow-up program of detailed mapping and sampling is planned for the fall months on both the new claims and the original Kinkaid claim block.

"This very exciting new discovery, along with so many other occurrences discovered by Romios on the Kinkaid property, illustrates how cost-effective exploration can be done on the Company's Nevada projects," stated Stephen Burega, CEO of Romios. He added, "our crews are able to reach underexplored areas by Jeep and on foot and come up with exciting new discoveries with real potential. We are looking forward to following up on this latest find in the next 2 months."

_**Background**_

The Kinkaid property now consists of 131 claims, covering approximately 11.0 sq km, located 18 km east of the town of Hawthorne where the prolific Walker Lane trend overlaps the southern edge of the mineral-rich Basin and Range geological province.

_**QA/QC**_

All samples were submitted to the ISO/IEC 17025 accredited ALS laboratory in Reno, Nevada for assay. As a matter of procedure, a rigorous quality assurance and quality control program was implemented in the form of blanks and Certified Reference Material standards at every 10th position in the sample series. The assay results of these standards and blanks were within the acceptable ranges.
