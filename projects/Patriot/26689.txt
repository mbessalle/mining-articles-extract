# United Lithium Corp. Completes Staking of Large Land Position in Historical Lithium Pegmatite Producing Area near Ohio City, Colorado

  * _a rock chip sampling program has been conducted to identify new areas for detailed field work_  




VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Lithium Corp. (CSE: [ULTH](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1W574TkZqSD7QPG7KgrYVDZ49ibjdck2yq-qgoHC1yd2uBN8PZCcMwYOXaqonsdED0Y98DmpeDVR5wCZMdWZHDTK2UbiH_ZPCXBqxxTjbvfZ9LiE58rsChEvbdFo7rI7 "ULTH"); OTC: [ULTHF](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5oJyQt3c1lMYRbSVbGwIPd0G5ANz77ZmcKii80jdHsvbLNyBQh-lvLyuwPor3NcQsbTFdTsN9GJYzpKgtEXfXbF8M9yQrHXwmao-gtBlE5A= "ULTHF"); FWB: [0ULA](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YGkgiymepfE2Qnt0690-osknQAaz57GjDASO1GdwYj1IVyhU83hlySmuNEAYoihpep9Z2wSbhAswrtJ5DCFWi3PzbL_5EUEQCBCRo3rjpGxnr42l4HfsNBhFEWxhnQ8W "0ULA")) (“**ULTH** ” or the “**Company** ”) is pleased to announce that it has established a large land position in a historic lithium-beryllium producing area of Gunnison County of Colorado. The Company has completed staking of over 300 unpatented lode claims covering more than 9 square miles (nearly 25 square kilometers) near Ohio City, Colorado, surrounding the Black Wonder granite. The “Patriot Lithium Project” hosts numerous pegmatite bodies, several of which have been mined for Li-Be. United Lithium’s claim block covers or surround all past LCT (lithium, cesium, tantalum) pegmatite production in the Ohio City area.  


A reconnaissance rock chip sampling program was carried out in conjunction with the staking program to identify new areas for detailed field work. Samples have been submitted to the laboratory and assays are awaited.

Michael Dehn, CEO of United Lithium stated, “We are planning an integrated exploration program to evaluate the Ohio City area land holdings. The program will include local area detailed geologic mapping and additional rock chip sampling. With anomalies well-defined, targets with be drilled in the coming year when permits and contracts are in place.”

A general outline of the United Lithium claims is presented below. The area staked covers the public lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). There are private property holdings within the USFS lands and the claims are positioned and located to recognize the pre-existing, titled ownership rights.

**Historic Lithium – Beryllium Pegmatite Mining in the Ohio City Area**

The Patriot Lithium project is part of the Quartz Creek pegmatite field. It is located 17 miles due east of City of Gunnison, in Gunnison County. The Patriot Lithium Project comprises three blocks of claims that are located between Parlin and Ohio City, Colorado and illustrated on Map 1. The two northern “Ohio City” claim blocks are separated by privately owned lands and a highway right-of-way. A sequence of younger, Paleozoic rocks separate the Ohio City claims from the southern “Parlin” claimblock. More than 1,800 individual pegmatite bodies were mapped around the Black Wonder granite by the US Geological Survey. The mapped pegmatites demonstrate zonation where the pegmatites closest to the Black Wonder granite are less evolved while the more distalpegmatites are geochemically evolved and commonly enriched in lithophile elements like Li, Be, Sn, Cs, Rb, etc. The more evolved pegmatites hosted lithium and beryllium former mines and occurrences, including the well-known Brown Derby pegmatite mine, as well as the Bazooka, White Spar and Opportunity pegmatites.

**Reconnaissance Rock Chip Geochemical Sampling**

A geological crew worked in conjunction with the staking crew in the Ohio City – Parlin areas, highlighting areas for coverage, and more importantly, collecting 243 surface rock chip samples from many pegmatite outcrops for geochemical analysis. Lithium minerals were identified in a number of the outcrop samples, including abundant lepidolite, spodumene and tourmaline (elbaite), while beryl was the chief beryllium mineral. Other minerals reported in the pegmatites from this area, but not recognized in hand specimens, include monazite, columbite, tantalite, microlite, rynersonite, gahnite, zircon, allanite, amblygolite, pollucite and stibiotantalite.

The pegmatites of the Ohio City- Parlin area contributed to the economic development of the region and contributed significantly to the war efforts of the 1940s and 1950s. The Brown Derby pegmatite mines were of particular note for their Li and Be production as well as a locale for several collectible mineral species.
