Mt Isa North Project Overview
The Mt Isa North Project comprises approximately 2,003km2 of granted and pending exploration
tenements located near the city of Mount Isa in Northwest Queensland, Australia.
The Mount Isa region is one of the world’s premier exploration and mining locations, hosting:
▪ four of the world’s ten largest Zn-Pb-Ag deposits (Mount Isa, George Fisher, Century and
Cannington);
▪ the globally significant Mount Isa Cu-Co deposit (pre-mining metal inventory of 255Mt @ 3.3% Cu;
Geological Survey of Queensland, 2011); and
▪ the Valhalla project (148.3Mlbs @ 680ppm U O ; Paladin, 2023) which is Australia’s 3rd largest
3 8
uranium resource.
In addition, the Mt Isa region hosts extensive mining-oriented infrastructure, numerous mines and
processing facilities, water and power utilities, rail and national highway transport connections,
frequent commercial air services, city services, and a skilled labour force.
Capella’s exploration model at Mount Isa recognises that world-class discoveries may be made in
structurally favourable sites in parts of the stratigraphy largely overlooked by previous explorers, as well
as in various units of known prospectivity that have only been superficially explored within the
Company’s tenements.

Surprise Mine Prospect
The Surprise and Startle prospects are situated within EPM 28297, ~80km NE of the city of Mount Isa.
Surprise and Startle are examples of structurally-hosted high-grade Cu-Au targets of Iron-Sulphide
Copper Gold (ISCG) style.
The 2.5km long Surprise trend is centred on the abandoned high-grade Cu-Au Surprise mine whereas
Startle is located 6km to its north-east. Both prospects are examples of structurally controlled
magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au mineralisation. The Surprise mine exploited a 3m to 10m thick vein of
coarse calcite containing pods and stringers of chalcopyrite and pyrite. Recorded production amounts
to ~5,600 tonnes of ore grading at between 10 to 22 % Cu and 2 to 4 g/t Au with significant Ag.
Modern exploration in the vicinity of Surprise commenced in the late 1960s and continued
intermittently until 2019. The exploration results of most relevance to the Surprise trend include
anomalous soils (up to 0.1% Cu with Cu oxide minerals) and rock chip data (up to 3.27 % Cu and 1.68
g/t Au) extending ~2km north of the mine, an airborne EM survey with numerous untested conductive
anomalies, and drilling during the 1970’s by VAM Ltd and by Gateway in the mid-2010’s. Significant
drilling results include:
▪ 23.77m @ 4.67% Cu from 51.21m (SH30)
o Incl. 3.65m @ 3.15% Cu from 51.21m; and 12.80m @ 7.77% Cu from 62.18m
▪ 3.66m @ 9.53% Cu from 22.25m & 1.83m @ 1.70% Cu from 16.76m (SH37)
▪ 3.66m @ 2.70% Cu from 53.34m & 3.66m @ 1.50% Cu from 77.11m (SH41)
▪ 4.00m @ 2.83% Cu + 0.61g/t Au from 102m (SU007)
▪ 2.00m @ 2.83% Cu + 1.45g/t Au from 124m (SU001)
▪ 1.83m @ 4.10% Cu from 21.64m (SH40)
Capella’s recent grab samples from the Surprise mine returned high-grade Cu assays ranging from 8.00
% to 36.8 % Cu, with anomalous Au ranging from 0.15 g/t to 0.39 g/t Au, and 244 ppm to 844 ppm total
rare earth oxide (TREO; including Y and Sc, refer Appendix C).
▪ 36.8% Cu, 0.38g/t Au, 244ppm TREO (CMRK005)
▪ 28.7% Cu, 0.15g/t Au, 330ppm TREO (CMRK004)
▪ 8.00% Cu, 0.39g/t Au, 844ppm TREO (CMRK006)
Glencore undertook an airborne electromagnetic (VTEM) and magnetic survey in 2015 to detect buried
massive sulphide mineralisation. This survey used east-west flight lines spaced at 150m. Two
conductivity anomalies occur in the vicinity of the Surprise mine (anomalies 6 and 7 see Figure 4). A
third anomaly was identified during a review of the data by Capella’s consultant Terra Resources (“Un-
named” anomaly see Figure 4). Anomaly 6 corresponds to the Surprise Mine and is interpreted to reflect
a down-plunge continuation of Cu sulphide mineralisation that is untested by drilling (Figure 2 and
Figure 4).

Exploration at Surprise and Startle will aim to:
▪ conduct a 3D IP survey along the Surprise Trend to map Glencore VTEM anomaly 6 at depth and
identify additional Cu sulphide targets;
▪ extend the existing IP survey at Startle to the south;
▪ carry out new drilling to confirm the historical drilling and contribute to a JORC-compliant
resource estimate at Surprise; and
▪ drill-test Glencore’s VTEM anomalies and any anomalies generated by the Surprise & Startle IP
surveys.

Conglomerate Creek Prospect
Conglomerate Creek Prospect is located 40km NNE of Mount Isa city and includes over 15km strike
length of the Conglomerate Creek Fault which Capella believes is prospective for Mount Isa style Cu-
Co, Zn-Pb-Ag and Iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) style deposits. The exploration target is a block of
Mount Isa Group sediments hypothesised to occur beneath the Eastern Creek Volcanics and
favourable trap sites for mineralisation within the Eastern Creek Volcanics.
Furthermore, radiometric data shows both anomalous uranium and potassium in the Conglomerate
Creek area, which suggest that a buried intrusion may have produced the radiometric, geophysical and
geochemical anomalies with the potential for associated IOCG style mineralisation.
Accordingly, the target deposits are:
▪ A large Mount Isa style Cu-Co or Zn-Ag-Pb deposit, thought to occur within Mount Isa Group rocks
concealed in a structurally blind location beneath the Eastern Creek Volcanics
▪ Ernest Henry style Cu + Au IOCG deposit
There are numerous historical workings at Conglomerate Creek with minor Cu production from shallow
pits. The occurrence of minor Sb (antimony) at Antler and Antimony Hill mines is particularly
encouraging as Sb is a known pathfinder element within 1 to 1.5km of economic mineralisation at
Mount Isa mine.
The Conglomerate Creek geochemical and geophysical anomalies have never been drilled. NIS
proposes to use modern ultra-detailed drone-borne magnetic and ground-based gravity surveys to
define a potential subtle gravity and magnetic anomaly associated with base metal mineralisation and
alteration, ahead of drilling. Geophysical anomalies will be drilled and tested with down-hole EM to
detect off-hole sulphide mineralisation.

Calton Hills Prospect
Calton Hills is located within EPM 28792, 65km NNE of the city of Mount Isa. Previous exploration has
provided compelling evidence of large Cu mineralised hematite breccias, potentially related to the
IOCG mineral systems in the Eastern Succession, and rock types favourable to Cu mineralisation.
Calton Hills prospect is centred on a 2km x 2.5km fault-bounded basin of Mount Isa Group
metasediments surrounded by rocks of the Eastern Creek Volcanics (ECV). Rock types favourable to
Cu-Au mineralisation are the Moondarra Siltstone and Breakaway Shale. The Moondarra Siltstone
consists of thin-bedded carbonaceous and pyritic dolomitic metasiltstones, and the Breakaway Shale
consists of carbonaceous to siliceous metapelites. Calton Hills basin aligns with a regional-scale NW-
trending structure, which is interpreted as a basin-bounding growth fault that facilitated initial
sedimentation and later basin closure and introduction of mineralising fluids.
The dominant structures of the area are the NW-trending Great Western Fault and the NE-trending
Northern Fault which dip steeply and show reverse and strike slip movement. They emplace older ECV
above the Mount Isa Group, in a similar structural setting to the Mount Isa Cu and Zn-Pb-Ag ore bodies
65km to the south.
NIS proposes to focus on a 3km x 1.5km area covering the hematite breccia and Northern Fault which
has been only lightly drilled along it’s strike length, using modern ultra-detailed drone-borne magnetic
and ground-based gravity surveys. These programs are intended to define a potential subtle gravity and
magnetic anomaly associated with base metal mineralisation and alteration, ahead of drilling.
Geophysical anomalies will be drilled and tested with down-hole EM to detect off-hole sulphide
mineralisation.

Regional-Scale Faults Prospects
The Regional-Scale Faults prospects are associated with three broadly north-south trending major
structures, the Mount Isa, Paroo and Hero Faults. Target deposit styles are Mount Isa-style sediment-
hosted Cu-Co and Zn-Ag-Pb deposits, and magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au deposit types.
Approximately 50km of each of the Mount Isa and Hero Faults, and 30km of the Paroo Fault occur within
the Company’s tenements.
NIS considers that the Mount Isa, Hero and Paroo faults have been only superficially explored along
much of their length, owing to the focus of previous explorers on exploring within the Urquhart Shale.

ASX: NIS | nickelsearch.com 11

Julius Prospect
The Julius prospect is located on EPM 27947, 63km north of Mount Isa city and 15km west of Lake Julius.
The target is structurally-controlled magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au mineralisation associated with a
quartz breccia vein.
The Julius vein occurs within metabasalt of the Eastern Creek Volcanics and crops out as a prominent
blade-like ridge ~600m in length and up to 15m wide. Pyrite and chalcopyrite occur in parts of the vein,
and malachite is found in patches in the adjacent metabasalt. It appears there is a N-S fault offsetting
the vein with dextral movement of some 800m suggesting potential fault-offset extensions to
mineralisation in the area nearby.
Capella recently collected a grab sample from malachite-chalcocite bearing float material adjacent to
the quartz ridge, that assayed 39.5 % Cu + 1.62 g/t Au + 5.8 g/t Ag (CMRK003, refer Appendix G). It
appears the strongest Cu mineralisation occurs in chalcocite-rich pods along the southern margin of
the quartz breccia vein.

ASX: NIS | nickelsearch.com 12

Gunpowder Creek Prospect
The Gunpowder Creek Prospect is located near the northern boundary of EPM 27947, 75km north of
Mount Isa city. The target is structurally-controlled magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au mineralisation
comprising a NW striking quartz breccia vein that is up to 5m wide and outcrops over 7.5km of strike
length. The vein has been lightly prospected with shallow artisanal miner’s pits and trenches of
unknown age. Approximately 2.5km of the vein’s strike length occurs within Capella’s tenure.
Geopeko’s reconnaissance mapping and rock chip sampling in the 1990’s traced malachite-rich quartz
vein material for several kilometres. Cu and Au values were found to be patchy, with samples generally
assaying in the range 0.1 % to 1.0 % and up to 13.7 % Cu, and from 0.1 g/t to 1.0 g/t and up to 2.95 g/t
Au (Refer to Appendix H). Capella recently collected a grab sample from malachite- bearing quartz vein
that assayed 7.32 % Cu + 0.65 g/t Au + 6.4 g/t Ag (CMRK001, refer Appendix H).

Uranium Prospects
Capella’s tenement package has considerable potential for the discovery of major uranium deposits.
The tenements surround Paladin Energy Ltd’s (ASX: PDN) (Paladin) Mount Isa Project, which comprises
148.3 Mlb U O across 10 deposits (Paladin, 2023), making it the 3rd largest uranium project in Australia
3 8
behind Olympic Dam and Jabiluka (World Nuclear Association 2022, 2023).
Exploration in the wider Mount Isa region has already led to the discovery of 17 deposits, with all
discoveries except Skevi made by prospectors in the 1950’s. Most of the known deposits are
categorised as albitite U-type, of which the largest example in the region is Paladin Energy’s Valhalla
deposit.
Capella’s tenement EPM28792 includes the JORC 2004 historical estimate at Queens Gift, and two
other significant deposits occur within Capella’s tenements at Skevi (EPM 27439) and Joker (EPM
28793).

Queens Gift Prospects
Queen’s Gift represents Capella’s most advanced uranium exploration target. In 2007 - 2011,
significant drilling was undertaken by Deep Yellow Ltd (ASX: DYL) (Deep Yellow) at Queen’s Gift in order

Deep Yellow announced the current Queen’s Gift mineral resource estimate to the ASX on 8 July 2011
(“Successful Exploration Programme Grows Queensland Resource Base”) (Table 2). This estimate was
not prepared or released under the current JORC 2012 guidelines so is classified as an historical
estimate. This estimate was prepared by Coffey Mining Pty Ltd, an industry-renowned consultancy, and
is considered to be reliable in light of the criteria described in the original Deep Yellow announcement.
The estimate implied an open pit mining scenario (<250 m depth) at various open pit mining cut-off
grades.
Table 2: Queen’s Gift JORC (2004) Historical Estimate sourced from Deep Yellow Ltd (DYL) ASX announcement dated 8
July 2011 (“Successful Exploration Programme Grows Queensland Resource Base”; Table 15).
It is cautioned that the Queen’s Gift mineral estimate was reported under the 2004 edition of the
JORC code and is not reported in accordance with the current 2012 edition of the JORC code. It is
not certain that further exploration and evaluation will permit the historical estimate to be
reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 code.
The competent person has not done sufficient work to classify the estimate as a mineral resource in
accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The competent person, Richard Maddocks, confirms that the
ASX: NIS | nickelsearch.com 15

information in this market announcement is an accurate representation of the available data and
studies for the Queens Gift Inferred Mineral Resource. An assessment of the 2011 release of the
Queens Gift mineral resource, and the underlying data and assumptions, has been used to establish
reliability in the estimate as it was released under the 2004 edition of the JORC code. The Queens Gift
mineral resource is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting documentation
reviewed by Richard Maddocks, a Competent Person. Mr Maddocks is a director of Capella Metals and
is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
NIS and Capella are not in possession of any new information or data relating to this historical estimate
that materially impacts on the reliability of the estimate or on Capella’s ability to verify the historical
work. The supporting information provided in Deep Yellow’s initial public announcement continues to
apply and has not materially changed.
NIS plans to undertake infill and extensional RC drilling to verify the historical estimate. This exploration
work is intended to be funded from this current raising and commenced when drilling approvals are
received.
A summary of the work programs on which the Queens Gift estimate is based and a summary of the key
assumptions, mining and processing parameters and methods used to prepare the Queens Gift
estimates are listed below.
• The Deep Yellow RC samples were collected at 1m intervals in mineralised zones into a three
tiered splitter to obtain a 2-3kg final sample. Diamond core was halved with samples taken
every metre in mineralisation. Sample processing was undertaken at Amdel Laboratories in Mt
Isa and consisted of drying for 24 hours, crushing in a LM5 pulverised, splitting of an
approximate 200g sub-sample, then analysis for uranium by pressed pallet XRF.
• Drilling coverage for the project areas ranges from a nominal 50m by 50m to 25m by 25m. The
drillholes are typically orientated perpendicular to the trend of the targeted mineralisation with
a typically hole setup dip of 60°. Only RC and diamond drilling and sampling undertaken by
Deep Yellow were used in the estimate
• A total of 122 holes were used to model the Queens Gift Resource.
• The bulk of the assays used for the Queens Gift Mineral Resource were analysed using XRF.
Radiometric down-hole gamma assays were used after appropriate factoring. A total of 2,716
individual chemical and 263 radiometric assays were used to inform the Queens Gift estimate.
• Density data was collected from the diamond core utilising the water immersion method (both
with and without wax) with backup data by air pycnometry of RC pulps.
• A nominal 100ppm U3O8 lower cutoff was used to define the mineralised zones. The resulting
mineralisation interpretations showed generally good geological and sectional continuity.
• The topographic surface was defined using a combination of DGPS pickup of the drillhole
collars and local DTM surfaces for the individual deposit. A DTM surface representing the base
of oxidation/base of weathering was determined based upon Deep yellow’s geological logging.
A density of 2.64t/m3 was used to report any weathered material for the modelled
mineralisation.
• The assay data was composited to 1m downhole with statistical analyses on the 1m
composites undertaken. Variography and search neighbourhood analysis were also conducted
as input into grade estimation. High grade cutting was applied to the composites prior to
estimation.
• The method used to obtain grade estimates within the mineralised zones for U3O8 was block
Ordinary Kriging (OK). Density was applied to each of the deposits based upon a statistical
analysis of the density and SG data. An in-situ dry bulk density of 2.85t/m3 for the Queens Gift
Prospect.
• Resource classification was developed from the confidence levels of key criteria including
drilling methods, geological understanding and interpretation, sampling, data density and
ASX: NIS | nickelsearch.com 16

location, grade estimation and the quality of the estimate. Material deeper than a nominal
250m from surface was not classified.

Skevi & Joker Prospects
The Skevi deposit is located 8km east of Skal and was discovered by Regalpoint Resources Ltd as part
of an Australia-wide prospectivity analysis for albitite-type uranium (O. Kreuzer, personal
communication, 2017). Skevi drilling includes intersections of up to 4m at 1,548ppm U O from 26m
3 8
(PSRC023, refer Appendix F) (Regalpoint Resources, 2011).
Joker is located 5km south of Paladin’s Duke Batman deposit. Only four drillholes have been completed
here. The best intersection was 10m @ 333 ppm U O from 39m (JR004, refer Appendix F) (Fusion
3 8
Resources Ltd, 2011).
AGIP 3 Prospect
AGIP Nucleare in 1973-4 explored multiple radiometric anomalies on Capella’s tenure, with the best
results obtained at the #3 prospect, referred to below as AGIP 3. AGIP 3 comprises two NNW-trending
radiometric anomalies with a combined strike length of 215m. Encouraging rock chip assays were
recorded with results ranging from background up to 1.36 % U O (refer Appendix I ). AGIP tested the
3 8
surface anomalies with 15 shallow percussion holes and 2 diamond core holes with results not
available. Nevertheless, AGIP 3 remains prospective and owing to the shallow depth and historical
nature of the AGIP Nucleare holes further drilling is warranted.

Table 3: Summary of rock chip results from AGIP Nucleare’s exploration on Capella’s tenements (refer Appendix I)
Proposed Uranium Exploration Program
Much of Capella’s tenure has been covered by airborne radiometric surveys. Consultants Terra
Resources were engaged by Capella to define targets and they identified thirty based on radiometric
imagery.
An older prospectivity analysis was undertaken by Paladin which attempted to identify targets at depth
(i.e. without surface radiometric response; Wilde et al., 2018). Sixteen targets identified by this analysis
are within Capella’s tenements (Figure 12), and most of them have not been drill-tested.
NIS proposes to conduct initial field reconnaissance and outcrop, and auger drilling to make new
discoveries under shallow regolith cover. RC drilling will be conducted at resulting anomalies, and at
Queens Gift to confirm the historical drilling and update the historical estimate to JORC (2012)
compliance.
A field visit will be undertaken in order to prioritise the many targets for follow-up. Follow-up will initially
involve shallow auger drilling in areas with substantial thicknesses of cover, noting that radiometric
response could be largely obscured by 1 m of dense cover, e.g. transported overburden. RC drilling will
then test the high priority targets. These could include the known mineralisation at Queen’s Gift, Skevi,
Joker and AGIP 3 as well as targets prioritised from the previous phase of work. RC holes will be logged
using downhole gamma to establish uranium grade.

Single Tranche Placement (Placement) and proposes to launch a $2.14 million underwritten Non-
Renounceable Entitlement Offer (Entitlement Offer) (Collectively the Offer or Capital Raising).
Placement
The Company has secured binding commitments to raise ~$0.56 million (before costs) through a
placement of 37,170,737 new fully paid ordinary shares in NIS (Placement Shares) at an issue price of
$0.015 per share (Issue Price).
The Issue price of $0.015 represents a 25% discount to NIS’ last close on 22 August 2024 of $0.020, a
16.9% discount to the 5-day VWAP of $0.01804 and a 16.0% discount to the 15-day VWAP of $0.01786.
The Placement is not subject to shareholder approval and will fall within the Company’s existing
placement capacity under ASX Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A.
Placement Shares will rank equally with existing fully paid ordinary shares. Settlement of the Placement
is expected to be completed on Friday, 6 September 2024 with allotment the following Monday, 9
September 2024.
NIS will issue one (1) free attaching option (Placement Options) for every two (2) Placement Shares
issued pursuant to the Placement. The Placement Options will be exercisable at $0.030 per share, each
with an expiry date 30 June 2027, and will be issued subject to shareholder approval at the General
Meeting.
Together with existing cash reserves of ~$2.0M, the Capital Raising ensures NIS is well funded to
execute the following:
▪ Copper and uranium exploration, including targeting work and drilling, on the Mt Isa North Project;
▪ Continue target generation and lithium exploration at the Carlingup Lithium Project
▪ Funding and execution of the Capella Transaction; and
▪ General working capital purposes.
Discovery Capital Partners Pty Ltd and Cumulus Wealth Pty Ltd (together, the Joint Lead Managers)
acted as Joint Lead Manager to the Capital Raising. As partial consideration for the joint lead manager
services, NIS has agreed to issue, subject to shareholder approval, 15,000,000 New Options (on the
same terms as the Placement Options and Entitlement Options) to be split evenly between the Joint
Lead Managers (Lead Manager Options).

5:00pm (Perth time) on Friday, 6 September 2024 (Record Date), at an issue price of $0.015 per share
to raise ~$2.14M (before costs). The Entitlement Offer is fully underwritten by Discovery Capital

MIM and Summit (MIM Data Acquisition System) is
a geophysical system that collected

multichannel geophysical response data
