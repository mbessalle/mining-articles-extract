    "description": "<p><strong>COLORADO SPRINGS, CO / ACCESSWIRE / February 7, 2024 /</strong> Fortitude Gold (OTCQB:FTCO) (the &quot;Company&quot;) today announced it has acquired 100% interest in two separate gold properties within Nevada's Walker Lane Mineral Belt. The first being the Dauntless gold property, which includes the historic Weepah gold mine, located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately 30 kilometers southwest of Tonopah, Nevada. The second being the Intrepid claim package, located in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 10 kilometers northwest of Mina, Nevada. Fortitude Gold is a gold producer, developer, and explorer with operations in Nevada, U.S.A. offering investors exposure to both gold production and dividend yield.</p><p>The Dauntless claim package was purchased from Nevada Select Royalty Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold Royalty Corp. The approximate 2,105-acre land package has seen historic high-grade gold production from both open pit and underground workings with undeveloped drill intercepts including 16 meters of 3.36 grams per tonne (g/t) gold. Fortitude Gold staked 129 additional unpatented claims around the property to strengthen the land position and exploration potential.</p><p>Dauntless acquisition highlights include:</p><ul><li>100% ownership</li><li>Historic gold production grade estimated at 3.1 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Sunshine Mining Company)</li><li>Open pit heap leach project potential</li><li>Surface and near surface gold drill intercepts*</li><li>Historic drill intercepts include 38.1 meters of 1.18 g/t gold from surface*</li><li>Historic drill intercept over 16 meters of 3.36 g/t gold ~70 meters deep*</li><li>Rock chip samples up to 60 g/t gold*</li><li>Proximity to Company's producing Isabella Pearl mine (~100 kilometers)</li><li>Potential equipment and processing facility synergies with Company's Isabella Pearl project</li><li>105 unpatented lode mining claims; 1 patented mining claim</li><li>129 additional claims staked surrounding property</li><li>4,680 acres total acquired and staked high-grade gold exploration property</li><li>Mining friendly jurisdiction, Nevada, U.S.A.<br />*Third party drill intercepts and rock chip samples</li></ul><p>The Company purchased 100% interest in the Dauntless claim package for total consideration of US$725,000. Nevada Select Royalty Inc retained a maximum net smelter return royalty (NSR) of 3% on future production from the property claims.</p><p>The property warranted acquisition for reasons including surface and near surface high-grade gold, historic high-grade gold production, exploration potential, and its location in the Walker Lane Mineral Belt within trucking distance to the Company's Isabella Pearl gold processing facility. Historic mining records indicate during the mid-1980's a small portion of the claims were mined by Sunshine Mining Company who reported 60,000 ounces of gold mined at an average grade of 3.1 grams per tonne (g/t) and a 1:1 strip ratio. Low historic metal prices closed the mine though it was estimated more mineralization remained.</p><p>Gold mineralization at Dauntless is believed to occur within two broad shear zones. The western shear zone hosts all historic production with a small open pit and adjacent underground workings, while the eastern shear zone was exploited by modest exploratory workings. Both shear zones have been traced for hundreds of meters along strike and down dip and appear to be open to the south. The Company's rock check samples confirmed widespread surface gold grades as high as 14 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (see map below).</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/d1f8ec72-36dc-4a86-bf3e-0fdfcad7d275/831966/ftco1.png\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><div> </div><p>Mineralization reported by third parties, including drill results upwards of 16.5 meters (54 feet) of 3.36 g/t gold, as a potential extension to the historic open pit warrant additional exploration to confirm, expand, and identify mineralized potential remaining.

Our near-term initial objective for the Dauntless includes drilling the mineralized structure to evaluate open pit expansion potential, as well as vector in on additional high-grade targets that have yet to be drilled. While we need to first confirm the historic third-party drill intercepts, twenty feet of over seven grams per tonne gold and fifty feet of over three grams per tonne gold is very exciting and warrants a drill campaign to test, confirm, and expand on this potential high-grade mineralization. Intrepid' s high-grade gold rock chip samples and proximity to our Isabella Pearl process facilities warranted acquisition as well. We are very excited to add these prospective properties to our growing Nevada land portfolio, all eight of which have surface and near surface high-grade gold.&quot;</p><p><strong>About Fortitude Gold Corp.:</strong></p><p>Fortitude Gold is a U.S. based gold producer targeting projects with low operating costs, high margins, and strong returns on capital. The Company's strategy is to grow organically, remain debt-free and distribute substantial dividends.
