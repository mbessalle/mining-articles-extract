KEY TENEMENT ACQUISITIONS UNDERPIN
SIDE WELL GROWTH POTENTIAL
HIGHLIGHTS
➢ GBR has acquired key tenements along strike from Mulga Bill on the Ironbark Trend
➢ Eight new high priority tenements include 7km of strike south of Mulga Bill and an
additional 3.8km south of the Ironbark Trend
➢ GBR now controls more than 35km of contiguous strike over the Side Well Gold Project
➢ AC drilling will commence on new targets at Side Well South in the coming week
➢ RC results from resource drilling at Mulga Bill are expected shortly
Great Boulder Resources (“Great Boulder” or the “Company”) (ASX: GBR) is pleased to announce
the acquisition of a group of priority tenements at the Company’s flagship Side Well Gold Project
(“Side Well”) near Meekatharra in Western Australia.
Great Boulder’s Managing Director, Andrew Paterson commented:
“This is a great acquisition for Great Boulder, giving us another 3.8km of strike immediately south of
our new targets at Side Well South. In addition we now have the tenement directly along strike from
Mulga Bill. This acquisition gives GBR more than 35km of contiguous tenure over the eastern half
of the Meekatharra greenstone belt, with excellent potential to continue making new discoveries as
we grow towards our million-ounce gold target.”
“GBR’s team has done a great job identifying targets at Side Well South. As soon as we saw the
potential there we were keen to lock down additional tenure along strike from those anomalies.”
“We’ll start the first drilling on our biggest target at Side Well South in the next few days as we
continue to balance new discovery opportunities with resource definition drilling, working towards
the resource update at the end of the year.”
Great Boulder has acquired an 80% interest in seven Prospecting Licences and one Exploration
Licence from Mark Selga and Wanbanna Pty Ltd. Consideration for the acquisition is $80,000 plus
$80,000 in GBR shares valued at a 5-day VWAP. The tenements will be operated as a joint venture
on the same terms and conditions as those tenements acquired from Wanbanna in August 2023.
Six of the prospecting licences are immediately south of the Side Well South project area, covering
the highly prospective mafic-ultramafic sequence which hosts the 18km-long Ironbark Corridor to the
north. This area has been subject to small-scale prospecting for many years, mainly limited to

surface detecting and scraping for alluvial gold. There are several small historic shafts in the area.
Previous drilling within the tenements has mainly been shallow RAB or vacuum drilling, with a small
number of AC and RC holes. With limited contemporary records available, further validation of the
data is required to establish which holes can be used for reporting to JORC 2012 standards.
E51/1679 sits over the central part of the Meekatharra greenstone belt south of Mulga Bill in the
same volcaniclastic sequence directly along strike from the Flagpole prospect. E51/1679 and
P51/3239 were explored by SensOre Ltd as part of their Tea Well Project, with AC and RC drilling
completed in 2021 and 2022 as well as one deep diamond hole, testing for a DPT® target within the
project area. Collar details and maximum down-hole gold and pathfinder assays for SensOre’s
drilling are listed in Table 2 below.

GBR’s exploration will attempt to capitalise on the Company’s experience of exploring in this terrain
by using AC drilling to test for continuations of the intrusive-related pathfinder elements characteristic
of the 568,000oz Au Mulga Bill deposit.

Next Steps
The RC rig is currently drilling extensional holes within the Mulga Bill resource area. Once this work
is completed a first-pass AC program will commence at Side Well South, testing the two large
geochemical anomalies recently identified with auger sampling.

Criteria Commentary
Mineral tenement and Side Well tenement E51/1905 is a 48-block exploration license covering an area of 131.8km2
land tenure status immediately east and northeast of Meekatharra in the Murchison province. The tenement is a 75:25
joint venture between Great Boulder and Zebina Minerals Pty Ltd.
Exploration done by Tenement E51/1905 has a protracted exploration history but is relatively unexplored compared to
other parties other regions surrounding Meekathara.
The tenements south of E51/1905 have mainly been held by prospectors for many years, with field
work limited to metal detecting, pushing and scraping for alluvial gold. Some AC drilling has been
completed in recent years but GBR has not yet validated the data to JORC standards.
SensOre Ltd held a joint venture with Wanbanna Pty Ltd from 2020 to 2023 during which they
explored the Tea Well project for gold mineralisation looking for a large target generated using their
DPT program. SensOre completed a ground gravity survey in collaboration with GBR followed by an
AC drilling program followed up with a limited RC and DD campaign.
Geology The Side Well tenement group covers a portion of the Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone Belt north
of Meekatharra, WA. The north-northeasterly-trending Archaean Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone
Belt, comprises a succession of metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic and felsic and sedimentary rocks
belonging to the Luke Creek and Mount Farmer Groups.
Over the northern extensions of the belt, sediments belonging to the Proterozoic Yerrida Basin
unconformably overlie Archaean granite-greenstone terrain. Structurally, the belt takes the form of
a syncline known as the Polelle syncline. Younger Archaean granitoids have intrusive contacts with
the greenstone succession and have intersected several zones particularly in the Side Well area.
Within the Side Well tenement group, a largely concealed portion of the north-north-easterly
trending Greenstone Belt is defined, on the basis of drilling and airborne magnetic data, to underlie
the area. The greenstone succession is interpreted to be tightly folded into a south plunging syncline
and is cut by easterly trending Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
There is little to no rock exposure at the Side Well prospect. This area is covered by alluvium and
lacustrine clays, commonly up to 60 metres thick.
Drill hole Information A list of the drill hole coordinates, orientations and intersections reported in this announcement are
provided as an appended table in the relevant announcements for each drilling program.
Data aggregation Results were reported using cut-off levels relevant to the sample type. For composited samples
methods significant intercepts were reported for grades greater than 0.1g/t Au with a maximum dilution of
4m. For single metre splits, significant intercepts were reported for grades greater than 0.5g/t Au
with a maximum dilution of 3m.
A weighted average calculation may be used to allow for bottom of hole composites that were less
than the standard 4m and when intervals contain composited samples plus 1m split samples.
No metal equivalents are used.
Relationship between The majority of drilling was conducted using appropriate perpendicular orientations for interpreted
mineralisation widths mineralisation. Stratigraphy appears to be steeply dipping to the west however mineralisation may
and intercept lengths have a different orientation. Cross sections are shown wherever possible to illustrate relationships
between drilling and interpreted mineralisation.
Diagrams Refer to figures in announcement.
Balanced reporting It is not practical to report all historical exploration results from the Side Well project. Selected
historical intercepts have previously been re-reported by GBR to highlight the prospectivity of the
