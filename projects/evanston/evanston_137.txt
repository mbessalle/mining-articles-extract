ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 11 December 2024
Divestment of Evanston and Yerilgee Projects
HIGHLIGHTS
• Dreadnought has finalised a binding sale and purchase agreement with Catalina Resources Ltd (ASX:CTN,
“Catalina”), to divest the Evanston and Yerilgee Projects (formally part of the Central Yilgarn Project). Subject to
Completion, the consideration for the sale is as follows:
• $250,000 ($25,000 received and balance on completion);
• Issue of 72,500,000 shares in Catalina (~5.5% of Catalina’s issued capital) upon completion;
• $1,000,000 milestone payment (payable in cash or shares at Catalina’s election) on the identification
of a Resource of 500,000oz gold or gold equivalent; and
• 1% net smelter return royalty on E30/0584.
• The divestment of Evanston and Yerilgee is aligned with Dreadnought’s focus on gold at Mangaroon and on
becoming a self-funded explorer.
Dreadnought Resources Limited (“Dreadnought”) is pleased to announce that a binding sale
and purchase agreement has been executed in relation to the Evanston and Yerilgee Projects
located in the Central Yilgarn region of WA.
Dreadnought’s Managing Director, Dean Tuck, commented: “When completed, the divestment of Evanston and Yerilgee
will be a win-win for both businesses. Catalina will have a project with significant scale within the Yilgarn Craton and
Dreadnought will have continued leverage to the project through its shareholding in Catalina, milestone payment and royalty.
Furthermore, this divestment aligns with Dreadnought’s focus on bringing the Star of Mangaroon into production, delivering
additional mineable ounces on our mining leases at Mangaroon and building a pipeline of high-grade gold targets for drill
testing in 2025.”

Investment Highlights
Mangaroon Au, Nb-REE, Ni-Cu-PGE Project (100%)
Mangaroon covers ~5,300kms2 and is
located 250kms south-east of Exmouth in
the Gascoyne Region of WA. At
Mangaroon, Dreadnought has consolidated
areas of outcropping high-grade gold and
historical high grade gold mines including
the historic Star of Mangaroon and
Diamond gold mines. Exploration at the
Money Intrusion has identified high tenor
Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides. In addition,
Mangaroon has emerged as a globally
significant, rapidly growing, potential source
of critical minerals. Highlights include:
• An independent Resource for Yin
Ironstones Complex of 29.98Mt @
1.04% TREO over only ~4.6kms –
including a Measured and Indicated
Resource of 26.3Mt @ 1.04% TREO
(ASX 30 Nov 2023).
• Discovery of the globally significant,
Nb-REE-P-Ti-Sc enriched Gifford
Creek Carbonatite (ASX 7 Aug 2023).
• A large, independent initial Resource
of 10.84Mt @ 1.00% TREO at the
Gifford Creek Carbonatites,
containing a range of critical minerals
including rare earths, niobium,
phosphate, titanium and scandium
(ASX 28 Aug 2023).
Kimberley Ni-Cu-Au Project
(80/100%)
The project is located only 85kms from
Derby in the West Kimberley region of WA and was locked up as a Defence Reserve since 1978.
The project has outcropping mineralisation and historical workings which have seen no modern exploration.
Results to date indicate that there may be a related, large scale, Proterozoic Cu-Au VMS system at Tarraji-Yampi,
similar to DeGrussa and Monty in the Bryah Basin.
Central Yilgarn Gold, Base Metals, Critical Minerals & Iron Ore Project (100%)
Central Yilgarn is located ~190km northwest of Kalgoorlie in the Yilgarn Craton. The project comprises ~1,400kms2
covering ~150km of strike along the majority of the Illaara, Yerilgee, South Elvire and Evanston greenstone belts.
Central Yilgarn is prospective for typical Archean mesothermal lode gold deposits, VMS base metals, komatiite-
hosted nickel sulphides and critical metals including Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum.
Prior to consolidation by Dreadnought, the Central Yilgarn was predominantly held by iron ore explorers and
remains highly prospective for iron ore.
Bresnahan HREE-Au-U Project (100%)
Bresnahan is located ~125km southwest of Newman in the Ashburton Basin. The project comprises ~3,700kms2
covering over 200kms strike along the Bresnahan Basin / Wyloo Group unconformity. Bresnahan is prospective for
unconformity related heavy rare earth (“HREE”) deposits similar to Browns Range HREE deposits, unconformity
uranium (“U”) deposits and mesothermal lode gold similar to Paulsens Au-Ag-Sb deposits along strike.
Prior to consolidation by Dreadnought, the Bresnahan Basin had been successfully explored for unconformity
uranium with limited exploration for mesothermal gold. Bresnahan is a first mover opportunity to explore for
unconformity HREE.
