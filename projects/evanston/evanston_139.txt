Belts offer substantial opportunities for mineral exploration. We think these areas are under explored as 
DRE have been focused on their Mangaroon (Ni-Cu-PGE REE Au) project while the previous owners of 
the Yerilgee and Evanston focused on the iron ore potential. With several high-grade gold targets 
identified and minimal follow-up to date, the exploration potential is significant, and we have already 
commenced a technical review to ensure a commencement to exploration as early as possible in 2025”.

Overview of the Yerilgee Greenstone Belt: 
The Yerilgee Greenstone Belt is a segment of the 2.9 Ga Western Yilgarn greenstone succession, 
characterized by a diverse geological composition of rock types. The belt comprises high-magnesium 
basalts, ultramafic volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks, and granites, including iron formations. Numerous 
structural dislocations readily seen in the aeromagnetic images, enhance the prospectivity for gold 
mineralisation. This geological diversity and the presence of significant structure makes the project a 
prospective area for various mineral deposits especially gold deposits.

Gold Mineralisation 
The Yerilgee Greenstone Belt currently hosts three primary camp-scale gold targets: T6, T8, and T11, 
illustrated in Figure 2. These exciting targets have shown proven mineralisation with several high-grade 
intercepts not followed up. Abundant gold in soil anomalies remain to be drilled or require additional 
drilling.

T6 Gold Camp. Defined by anomalous gold and pathfinder soil geochemistry over an area of 5,000m
x 3,000m. Drilling has intersected high-grade gold, with notable results including:
o
17m @ 4.1 g/t Au and 28 g/t Ag from 53m, including 4m @ 14.9 g/t Au and 72.2 g/t Ag.
o
16m @ 1.9 g/t Au from 0m, including 4m @ 8.5 g/t Au.
o
9m @ 2.6 g/t Au from 23m, including 3m @ 7.1 g/t Au.
Key prospects within T6 include Chicken Little, Snowflake, and Megatron and are illustrated 
in Figure 4.  
•
T8 Gold Camp (Figure 3): Defined by gold and pathfinder soil anomalism over 1,700m x 600m in
area. Initial drilling intersected:
o
17m @ 0.7 g/t Au from 22m, including 8m @ 1.2 g/t Au from 27m.
o
10m @ 0.8 g/t Au from 0m, including 1m @ 6 g/t Au from 11m.
•
T11 Gold Camp: This 20 km long gold in soil anomaly contains rock chip samples with up to
233 g/t Au (Figure 2). Independent geophysical reports have highlighted several high priority
aeromagnetic targets associated with a structural thickening of the greenstone sequence
within T11. This area has seen minimal follow-up work and is grossly underexplored.
Nickel Mineralisation The Yerilgee Greenstone Belt shares geological similarities with the Forrestania 
and Lake Johnston Greenstone Belts. Historical exploration has identified nickel sulphides within thick 
cumulate ultramafics and laterite nickel-cobalt mineralisation. Recent EM surveys have defined multiple 
conductors, highlighting significant targets such as N5 and N14 illustrated in Figure 2. 
Lithium Pegmatite Potential Exploration has identified multiple pegmatite swarms with anomalous 
surface geochemistry, indicating substantial lithium potential. These areas of the belt have not been 
historically assessed, presenting new exploration opportunities. 
Iron Ore and Magnetite Historical exploration for iron ore in the Yerilgee Greenstone Belt has identified 
high-grade magnetite mineralisation. The belt includes several compelling walk-up Fe-BIF targets that 
remain untested since 2016 due to previously depressed iron ore prices. The project lies south of 
Macarthur Minerals' Lake Giles project, which hosts over 1.3 billion tonnes of inferred magnetite 
resources.

Overview of the Evanston Greenstone Belt: 
Similar to Yerilgee, the Evanston Greenstone Belt is part of the 2.9 Ga Western Yilgarn greenstone 
succession. It consists of high-magnesium basalts, ultramafic volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks, and

Page 7 
granites, and iron formations. Numerous structural dislocations readily seen in the aeromagnetic 
images, enhance the prospectivity for gold mineralisation. This geological diversity and the presence of 
significant structure renders the project a prospective area for various mineral deposits, but especially 
gold. 
Gold Mineralisation  
The Evanston Greenstone Belt currently contains two main camp-scale gold targets: T1 and T2, with 
proven mineralisation and significant high-grade intercepts that have yet to be followed up (Figure 5). 
•
T1 Gold Camp: Characterized by high-magnesium basalts, ultramafic rocks, and banded iron
formations. Significant gold-in-soil anomalies and historical gold workings are situated along the main
banded iron formation horizon. Key findings include:
o
Viper: 15m @ 1.5 g/t Au from 12m, including 3m @ 6.7 g/t Au. Limited follow-up has been
conducted to date.
•
T2 Gold Camp: Dominated by a large regional north-plunging syncline, this camp includes significant
gold-in-soil anomalies and historical gold workings along major structural trends. Notable intercepts
include:
o
Leghorn: 48m @ 0.6 g/t Au from 27m, including 21m @ 1.3 g/t Au.
o
Erk: A 3km-long north-trending gold-in-soil anomaly with numerous nugget patches.
Lithium Pegmatite Potential 
The Evanston Greenstone Belt contains multiple pegmatite swarms with anomalous surface pathfinder 
geochemistry (Lithium, Caesium, Tantalum), suggesting a promising lithium potential similiar to 
Yerilgee.

T6 Gold Camp – Chicken Little
Geology
BIF hosted mineralisation associated with an intrusive felsic 
porphyry. Gold mineralisation is associated with significant silver 
and base metals. Initial drilling guided by a significant nugget 
patch that was discovered during earthworks.
Work Done
First pass aircore and two rounds of RC drilling has intersected 
variable mineralisation that could be due to plunging shoots or 
structural controls in an orientation oblique to drilling. 
T6 Gold Camp – Megatron
Geology
Megatron identified by intense ~600m x 400m gold in soil 
anomaly associated with major cross cutting structures and 
multiple phases of felsic and mafic intrusions. Gold mineralisation 
appears associated with a strong carbonate and sulphide altered 
felsic porphyry.
Work Done
5 aircore lines (400m first-pass spacing with 100m infill) 
T6 Gold Camp – Snowflake
Geology
Snowflake was identified by a ~800m x 200m gold and bismuth in 
soil anomaly associated with secondary N-S trending structure, 
significant quartz blow and felsic intrusions. High grade gold 
mineralisation was hosted within a near surface 1-2m quartz vein 
hosted within an altered felsic porphyry.  The orientation of the 
quartz vein is unknown and may be oblique to section. 
Work Done
First pass aircore drilling intersected significant mineralisation. No 
follow up drilling undertaken. 
T8 Gold Camp
Geology
•
The T8 prospect was defined by a 1.7km x 600m gold-in-soil anomaly associated 
with As-Sb-Bi-Mo-W pathfinders, adjacent to a regional scale NNE trending structure 
and intense localised magnetic anomaly. 
•
Drilling identified an anticlinal closure of a banded iron formation (BIF) which had 
been replaced by pyrite, arsenopyrite and quartz in three holes, and had been 
intruded by a felsic porphyry along a major regional lineament
Work Done
Soil sampling, 13-hole RC program, and aircore program that extended and 
refined the bedrock gold anomaly. Target has not since been followed up
Figure: T8 Prospect showing significant gold intersection, drill collars, 
soil anomaly and regional magnetics
Yerilgee –T11 Corridor
Geology
T11 is a ~20km long lithostructural corridor with gold in soil 
anomalism. Situated over a major regional structure with offsets within 
the center of the greenstone belt. Project wide gravity survey identified 
a significant blind intrusion at depth as a potential fluid and metal driver. 
Reviews by Jon Hronsky and Greg Hall both identified T11 as their 
favourite area. 
Work Done
Very limited first pass work completed and only a handful of aircore 
holes.  Recent work by Dreadnought has confirmed that UFF soils are 
more effective over the variable cover throughout the camp scale area. 
For target definition, 11,494 soils and 69 AC holes have been 
conducted. Only 2 RC holes drilled. No drilling since 2018 has been 
undertaken, and new prospective areas have been identified from soil 
geochemistry

Komatiite Nickel
The Yerilgee Greesntone Belt shares geological similarities to the 
Forrestania and Lake Johnston Greenstone Belts. Limited historical 
exploration has oberved the presence of nickel sulphides within thick 
cumulate ultramafics as well as laterite nickel-cobalt mineralisation. 
In 2023, Dreadnought engaged Newexco to conduct a nickel review 
with promising results
EM Surveys have defined multiple anomalies with first-pass work 
conducted by major nickel explorers
•
Western Areas Flew VTEM in 2015 
•
Arrow Minerals flew SkyTEM in 2020
•
Dreadnought Resources undertook a comprehensive review and follow 
up MLEM surveys, defining multiple targets around a central thickened 
komatiite unit
N5 and N14 have stood out as prioirty walk up drill targets as a result 
of this review and follow up target definition work which included 
groudn EM and surface geochemistry.
Exploration is still limited in coverage and there remains significant 
potential to define additional targets through systematic explroation.

Appendix 3 
JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 Report Template 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
DRE refers to Dreadnought Resources Ltd drilling and AMD refers to Arrow Minerals Ltd drilling. 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling techniques 
•
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples
should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
•
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
•
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
•
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done
this would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire
assay’). In other cases more explanation may be
required, such as where there is coarse gold that has
inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may
warrant disclosure of detailed information.
RC Drilling (DRE) 
Two sampling techniques were utilised for the RC program, 
1m metre splits directly from the rig sampling system for 
each metre and 3m composite sampling from spoil piles. 
Samples submitted to the laboratory were determined by the 
site geologist. 
From every metre drilled a 2-3kg sample (split) was sub-
sampled into a calico bag via a Metzke cone splitter from 
each metre of drilling or taken as a grab sample from the 
bulk reject in more clay-rich material. 
All remaining spoil from the sampling system was collected 
in buckets or green plastic mining bags if wet from the 
sampling system and neatly deposited in rows adjacent to 
the rig. An aluminium scoop was used to then sub-sample 
each spoil pile to create a 2-3kg 3m composite sample in a 
calico bag. 
QAQC samples consisting of duplicates, blanks, and CRM’s 
(OREAS Standards) will be inserted through the program at 
a rate of 1:50 samples. 
All samples are submitted to ALS Laboratories in Perth for 
determination of gold by fire-assay (ALS Method Au-ICP22). 
selected samples were also submitted for 48 multi-elements 
via 4 acid digestion with MS/ICP finish (ALS Code ME-
MS61) to assist with lithological interpretation. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
Aircore (AC) and Reverse Circulation (RC) chips were 
collected at 1m intervals. 3m composites were collected by a 
scoop sample from 1m sample piles. 
AC samples were collected via a cyclone return system 
attached to the drill rig. 
The sample was collected in buckets and placed in rows on 
the pad in 1m intervals. 
RC samples were collected via a static cone splitter mounted 
beneath a cyclone return system attached to the drill rig. 
The static cone splitter produces up to two samples in calico 
bags and a bulk reject sample, which was collected in a 
bucket and placed in rows on the pad in 1m intervals. 
1m sample splits were collected from the static cone splitter 
and placed on the sample piles for later analysis. 
2‐3 kg samples were collected from the sample piles. 
Field duplicates were collected on a 1:50 ratio to ensure 
repeatability of sampling method. 
CRM standards were inserted on a 1:50 ratio to test the 
calibration of lab equipment. 
Sample weights have been recorded and reported by the lab. 
Aircore and reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m 
samples which were placed on the ground from which a 
scoop was used to composite 3m samples weighing 
approximately 2‐3kgs being made up equally from each 
sample pile. 
These samples will be dispatched to ALS Laboratories in 
Perth for sample preparation and analysis. 
3 kg samples were pulverised to 85% passing 75 micron for 
an aqua regia digest of an 50g aliquot followed by ICP‐MS 
for gold (ALS Code Au‐TL44). 
ASX RELEASE. 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
If the samples returned values greater than 0.5ppm Au, then 
a 50g aliquot was fused by fire assay and finished by AAS. 
Drilling techniques 
•
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc.)
and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube,
depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type,
whether core is oriented and if so, by what method,
etc.).
RC Drilling (DRE) 
Challenge Drilling undertook the program utilising a KWL 380 
drill rig with additional air from an auxiliary compressor and 
booster. Bit size was 5.5”. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
Aircore drilling comprised of a 90mm aircore sampling bit. 
Reverse Circulation drilling comprised of a 90mm face 
sampling bit. 
Drill sample recovery 
•
Method of recording and assessing core and chip
sample recoveries and results assessed.
•
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and
ensure representative nature of the samples.
•
Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias may
have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of
fine/coarse material.
RC Drilling (DRE) 
Drilling was undertaken using a ‘best practice’ approach to 
achieve maximum sample recovery and quality through the 
mineralised zones. 
Best practice sampling procedure included: suitable usage of 
dust suppression, suitable shroud, lifting off bottom between 
each metre, cleaning of sampling equipment, ensuring a dry 
sample (when possible) and suitable supervision by the 
supervising geologist to ensure good sample quality. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
Drill sample recoveries are visually inspected on the rig and 
recorded in the drilling database. 
Drill samples are visually inspected during drilling to ensure 
sample recovery is satisfactory. 
Driller holds up drilling at each 1m interval to ensure sample 
has had time to travel up the drill string. 
No bias is known at this stage. 
Logging 
•
Whether core 
and chip samples 
have 
been
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of
detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.
•
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature.
Core (or costean, channel, etc.) photography.
•
The total length and percentage of the relevant
intersections logged.
RC Drilling (DRE) 
RC chips were logged under supervision of a qualified senior 
geologist with sufficient experience in this geological terrane 
and relevant styles of mineralisation using an industry 
standard logging system suitable to be utilised within a 
Mineral Resource Estimation. 
Lithology, mineralisation, alteration, veining, weathering and 
texture were all recorded digitally. 
Chips were washed each metre and stored in chip trays for 
preservation and future reference. 
Logging is qualitative, quantitative, or semi-quantitative in 
nature. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
All drill chips have been logged for lithology, mineralogy, 
weathering, regolith and alteration whilst in the field. 
All field descriptions are qualitative in nature. Chip trays have 
been retained for further work and re‐interpretation if 
required. 
All drill holes were logged in full. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample preparation 
•
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half
or all core taken.
•
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split,
etc. and whether sampled wet or dry.
•
For all sample types, the nature, quality and
appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.
•
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of
samples.
•
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is
representative of the in-situ material collected,
including 
for 
instance 
results 
for 
field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
•
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size
RC Drilling 
From every metre drilled, a 2-3kg sample (split) was sub-
sampled into a calico bag via a Metzke cone splitter or taken 
as a 3-metre composite scoop sample from the bulk reject. 
QAQC in the form of duplicates and CRM’s (OREAS 
Standards) are inserted at a rate of 1:50 samples. 
Samples will be submitted to ALS laboratories Perth, oven 
dried to 105°C and pulverised to 85% passing 75um to 
produce a 0.66g charge for determination of Gold by Fire 
Assay and ICP or AAS finish (ALS Method Au-ICP22 or Au-
AA25).  
Standard laboratory QAQC is undertaken and monitored.

of the material being sampled. 
All of the samples were dry. 
All samples were sent to ALS Laboratories in Perth for 
sample preparation and analysis using standard codes and 
practices. 
No subsampling undertaken. 
Field duplicates and certified reference materials (CRMs) 
were collected/inserted at a ~1:50 ratio. 
2‐3kg samples are considered appropriate for the rock type 
and style of mineralisation. 
Quality of assay data 
and laboratory tests 
•
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the
assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether
the technique is considered partial or total.
•
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF
instruments, etc., the parameters used in determining
the analysis including instrument make and model,
reading times, calibrations factors applied and their
derivation, etc.
•
Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g.
standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory
checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy
(i.e. lack of bias) and precision have been established.
RC Drilling (DRE) 
Assay technique is fire assays which is a ‘total technique’. 
Standard laboratory QAQC is undertaken and monitored by 
the laboratory and by the company upon assay results 
receival. 
All QAQC is deemed to have passed internal QAQC 
standards. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
All samples were submitted to ALS laboratories in Perth. 
Sample Preparation included riffle split to a maximum of 3kg 
(if required) and then pulverized to >85% passing 75 micron. 
Gold results were obtained from a 50 gram aliquot digested 
by aqua regia and analysis by ICP‐MS (ALS Code Au‐TL44) 
with a 1ppb detection limit. 
If samples returned values over 500ppb Au (0.5ppm), then a 
50 gram aliquot was analysed by fire assay with an AAS 
finish (ALS Code Au‐AA26). 
Aqua Regia can digest free gold and most gold compounds 
but may not digest all gold locked up in sulphides or trapped 
in silicate minerals. 
Fire assay is considered a total digest for gold. 
This procedure is considered appropriate for gold analysis. 
A fresh rock sample was collected from the end of hole and 
analysed for a 48 element suite (ALS Code ME‐MS61) via a 
four acid digest of a 0.25 gram aliquot finished with ICP‐MS. 
Four acid digest is considered a near total digest. 
Hyperspectral data was also collected from an end of hole 
sample on the coarse reject, as opposed to pulverized 
sample, by a TerraSpec 4 (TRSPEC‐20) and interpreted by 
AusSpec International (ALS Code INTERP‐11). 
Field duplicates and CRMs (certified reference materials) 
were inserted in to the sample string at a 1:50 ratio. 
The laboratory analyses a range of internal and industry 
standards, blanks and duplicates as part of the analysis. 
All field and lab QAQC demonstrate an acceptable level of 
precision and accuracy. 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
•
The verification of significant intersections by either
independent or alternative company personnel.
•
The use of twinned holes.
•
Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures,
data verification, data storage (physical and electronic)
protocols.
•
Discuss any adjustment to assay data.
RC Drilling (DRE) 
Logging and sampling were recorded and validated directly 
into a digital logging system (Plexer). 
Significant intersections have been inspected by senior 
company personnel. 
Twin holes were not employed as this is not part of a 
resource definition drilling program. 
No adjustments to any assay data have been undertaken. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
All significant results have been reviewed by the exploration 
manager. 
Primary data is recorded in the field in geological logbooks. 
This data is then recorded in a spreadsheet and imported to 
a digital database software package.

Collar position was recorded using a Emlid Reach RS2 RTK 
GPS system (+/- 0.2m x/y, +/-0.5m z). 
GDA94 Z50s is the grid format for all xyz data reported. 
Azimuth and dip of the drill hole was recorded after the 
completion of the hole using a Reflex Sprint Gyro. A reading 
was undertaken every 30th metre with an accuracy of +/- 1° 
azimuth and +/-0.3° dip. 
AC and RC Drilling (AMD) 
Sample locations were recorded with a Garmin handheld 
GPS which has an accuracy of +/‐5m. 
GDA94 MGA Zone 50 and Zone 51. 
The level of topographic control offered by the handheld 
GPS is considered sufficient for the level of exploration work 
undertaken.

classifications applied.
•
Whether sample compositing has been applied.
The drill spacing and distribution is not sufficient to establish 
the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for 
a Mineral Resource. 
Orientation of data in 
relation to geological 
structure 
•
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves
unbiased sampling of possible structures and the
extent to which this is known, considering the deposit
type.
•
If the relationship between the drilling orientation and
the orientation of key mineralised structures is
considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this
should be assessed and reported if material.
Drilling was undertaken at a near perpendicular angle to the 
interpreted strike and dip of the mineralised zones and 
known outcrop. 
No sample bias is known at this time. 
Sample security

results, the procedure used for such aggregation
should be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
•
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
Intercepts are length weight averaged. 
No maximum cuts have been made. 
All results greater than 0.2g/t Au or 0.2% Ni have been 
reported. 
Significant intercepts are length weight averaged for all 
samples with Au values >0.2g/t Au or o.2% Ni with up to 3m 
of internal dilution (<0.2g/t Au). 
No metal equivalents are reported. 
Relationship between 
mineralisation widths 
and intercept lengths 
•
These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
•
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the
drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
•
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’).
All intervals are reported as down hole intercepts. 
True widths are unknown at this stage of exploration. 
Diagrams 
•
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.

Commentary 
Balanced reporting 
•
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.
The accompanying document is a balanced report with a 
suitable cautionary note. 
The locations of previous drilling are shown in diagrams 
attached. More details can be found in the JORC tables of 
previous announcements.  
Other substantive 
exploration data 
•
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not limited to):
geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, 
groundwater, 
geotechnical 
and 
rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.
Suitable commentary of the geology encountered is given 
within the text of this document. 
Further work 
•
The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g.
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or
large-scale step-out drilling).
•
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible
extensions, 
including 
the 
main 
geological
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this
information is not commercially sensitive.
