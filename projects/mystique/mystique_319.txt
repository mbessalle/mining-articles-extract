ASX Announcement

ACN 649 994 669
Exploration licence E28/2513, known as the Mystique Project covers 35km2 within the Albany-
Fraser Province and is located approximately 225km SSE of Kalgoorlie.
The Mystique Project benefits indirectly from the results of seven years of systematic
exploration work by IGO on licences to the north and direct expenditure of approximately
$380,000 on E28/2513 that includes gravity surveying, MLEM (Moving Loop EM) and air core
drilling.
THE MYSTIQUE PROJECT
Transaction with IGO Limited
West Cobar has signed an Asset Sale Agreement (“ASA”) with IGO Newsearch Pty Ltd (a wholly
owned subsidiary of IGO Limited) (“INPL”) to acquire its interests in E28/2513 (100% held by
IGO Newsearch Pty Ltd and subject to a consent caveat registered by Loded Dog Prospecting
Pty Ltd (“Loded Dog”)).
In consideration for the transfer of its interests in the tenement referred to above, West Cobar
will issue to IGO a total of 5m unlisted options in WC1 with an exercise price of 8c and expiry
of 3 yrs from issue (subject to shareholder approval).
A Net Smelter Royalty held by Loded Dog is currently in place with respect to E28/2513 at a
rate of 1.5% for gold and 1% for all other minerals.
Under the terms of the ASA, this transaction will complete subject to several standard
conditions precedent, including but not limited to:
(a) WC1 obtaining shareholder approval in relation to the issue of the
consideration securities the subject of the ASA;
(b) obtaining consent from and entry into deeds of covenant with Loded Dog and
with the Ngadju native title organisation in relation to E28/2513.
The completion date deadline is 28 August 2025, and completion is expected to occur prior
to then. It is expected that the shareholder meeting to approve the issue of considerations
securities will be held mid April 2025.
West Cobar Metals’ Managing Director, Matt Szwedzicki, commented: “We are delighted to
have signed an agreement to acquire this strategic project at a time when WA gold exploration
assets are in strong demand.
The Mystique project comprises a key land area with exceptional and immediate potential for
both shallow and large scale gold deposits.
IGO’s exploration to date has provided highly encouraging results and we look forward to
exploring this additional Fraser Range tenement for gold in WA.”

Exploration to Date
The region remains relatively unexplored as most of the area is covered by 30m or more of
transported Eocene sediments and there is little surface expression of geology or
mineralisation.
Exploration work by IGO includes gravity surveying, MLEM (Moving Loop EM – ground survey
along lines 400m apart) and air core drilling (nine holes for 630m).

ASX Announcement
ASX: WC1
ACN 649 994 669
Prior to IGO’s involvement, the licence area E28/2513 had been explored for mineral sands
and for gold, notably by Iluka Resources Ltd1, Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd2, SIPA
Resources NL3 and Blackfire Resources Ltd4 who drilled 165 air core, seven RC and three
diamond holes.
The result is a data set which includes geophysics and a drill database, that enables West
Cobar to concentrate initially on well-defined high priority gold prospects.

Torquata Prospect
The Torquata prospect within the Mystique Project is a 3.5km long zone with widespread near
surface gold in transported material and calcrete. Samples taken from the top 2m to 6m of
air core holes contain up to 0.24g/t Au. In addition, underlying saprolite tested by
reconnaissance air core drilling returned gold values including: 2
TAC048 - 3m of 0.97g/t Au from 33m
TAC104 – 7m of 0.38g/t Au from 35m
The large 3.5km x 2.0km soil and calcrete gold anomaly (>10ppb Au) at Torquata is highly
significant (Geographe Resources Ltd)5 as well as widespread underlying anomalous gold
(>100ppb) in the saprolite from AC drilling by previous explorers Homestake Gold of Australia
Ltd,2 Sipa Resources NL3 and Blackfire Minerals Ltd4 (see Table 1). There remains considerable
untested potential for bedrock gold mineralisation, particularly in the vicinity and east of the
interpreted major structure that runs through the prospect (Figure 2).
The Torquata prospect shows some similarities with the distribution of anomalous gold to the
Tropicana gold deposit (approx 8Moz Au)6 also in the Fraser Range, with widespread gold
values in soil and sporadic gold values in saprolite from air core drilling, and with gneissic and
amphibolite host rocks. It was only through subsequent RC and diamond drilling that the
Tropicana discovery was confirmed.7
Next Steps
Priorities for West Cobar, subject to completion of its proposed acquisition of the Mystique
Project, are:
• Drill test key targets with lines of air core drilling to bedrock
• Establish saprolite resources
• Define and drill bedrock targets with RC drilling
THE THUNDERSTORM PROJECT
West Cobar has signed an Asset Sale Agreement (“ASA”) with IGO Newsearch Pty Ltd (a wholly
owned subsidiary of IGO Limited) (“INPL”) to acquire its 70% joint venture interests in
E28/2528, E28/2529 and E28/2595 (“JV Tenements”) that are contiguous with and lie north

of E28/2513 (Mystique Project). The remaining 30% interest is held by Rumble Resources
Limited (“Rumble”) which is free carried until the completion of a pre-feasibility study.
Rumble has the right to pre-empt the acquisition of the three JV Tenements and a waiver of
this right is part of the conditions precedent.
Subject to completion and subject to shareholder approval, and in consideration for the
transfer of its interests in the tenements referred to above, West Cobar will issue to IGO a
total of:
(a) 10m shares in WC1; and
(b) 5m unlisted options in WC1 with an exercise price of 8c and expiry of 3 yrs from
issue.
In addition, IGO will be granted a 1.5% Net Smelter Royalty over WC1’s share of production
revenue from the JV Tenements.
Under the terms of the ASA, this transaction completion is subject to several standard
conditions precedent, including but not limited to:
(a) WC1 obtaining shareholder approval in relation to the consideration securities
the subject of the ASA; and
(b) obtaining waiver of pre-emption rights, consent and entering a deed of
covenant with Rumble in relation to the JV Tenements.
The completion date deadline is 30 May 2025, and completion is expected to occur prior to
then. It is expected that the shareholder meeting to approve the issue of considerations
securities will be held mid April 2025.
