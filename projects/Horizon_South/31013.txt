# Refined Metals Corp Announces the Acquisition of the Horizon South Property in Tonopah, Nevada

_Horizon South is near American Lithium, American Battery Technology (ABTC), and Pan-American Energy Nevada Properties_

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Refined Metals Corp. (CSE: RMC) (OTC: RFMCF) (FRA: CWA0) (the “**Company** ” or “**Refined** ”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a property option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Horizon South Lithium Corp. (the “**Vendor** ”) pursuant to which the Company has been granted the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Horizon South Lithium Property (the “**Property** ”). The Property is comprised of 381 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 7,900 acres of land, located in the Big Smoky and Monte Cristo Basins of Esmeralda County, Nevada. The Company intends to explore the Property to determine the extent, if any, of claystone-hosted lithium mineralization.  


The Property is adjacent to Pan American Energy Corp’s Horizon Lithium Project which is permitted to drill 22 holes in the coming months. Nearby is American Battery Technology’s Tonopah Flats project, which is a recipient of the DOE Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grant for USD $10 million to develop a commercial processing facility for lithium hydroxide. Additionally, General Motors announced intentions to invest USD $650 million in American Lithium which hosts the TLC deposit in the region. There continues to be active consolidation in the region with significant support from the government for development, including a USD $700 million loan for Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge project.

Aman Parmar, Chief Executive Officer, comments, “The Property is in a highly sought after region and we are tremendously excited to acquire a property in such a high caliber neighbourhood. Nevada and the Tonopah jurisdiction are getting incredible support from federal, state, and county governments and have also emerged as leaders in lithium exploration and development. This has led to the increased interest in domestic lithium that has been driven by the electric vehicle and battery storage markets. The Agreement presents the Company with the ability to begin advancing the Property with exploration programs, which will also help us develop drill targets.”

**Option Agreement Terms**

Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, the Company has the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Property from the Vendor, in consideration for completing a series of cash payments and issuances of common shares (“**Common Shares** ”) in accordance with the following schedule:

**Deadline**| **Cash Payments**| **Common Share Issuances***  
---|---|---  
5 Business Days| -| C$250,000  
60 Business Days| C$250,000| C$250,000  
First Anniversary of Receipt of Drill Permits Necessary for the Company to Undertake Exploration Drilling (“**Drill Permits** ”)| C$250,000| C$750,000  
Second Anniversary of Receipt of Drill Permits| C$250,000| C$750,000  
  
_* To be settled with Common Shares valued at the greater of the 20-day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Common Shares on the due date of each Common Share obligation and the lowest price permissible pursuant to the policies of the exchange(s) on which the Common Shares are then listed._

All Common Shares issued to the Vendor pursuant to the Option Agreement will be subject to a twelve-month contractual escrow arrangement, during which time, subject to customary exceptions, such Common Shares may not be traded without the prior approval of the Company. The Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Option Agreement will be released from the escrow arrangement in four equal tranches: 25% will be released after three (3) months, a further 25% after six (6) months, a further 25% after nine (9) months, and the remaining 25% balance after twelve months. In addition, all Common Shares issued pursuant to the Option Agreement shall be subject to a statutory four month hold period pursuant to applicable Canadian securities laws. During the term of the Option Agreement, the Company will be the operator of the Property, and will be responsible for paying all exploration costs and maintenance fees owing to the Bureau of Land Management.

**Related Party Transaction Disclosure**

As a result of the foregoing, the Company’s entrance into the Option Agreement, and the potential issuance of Common Shares and the payment of Cash to the Vendor, is considered to be a “related party transaction” as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – _Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special_  _Transactions_  (“**MI 61-101** ”). The Company is relying on the exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements found in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the transaction is not more than 25% of the Company’s market capitalization. The Option Agreement was unanimously approved by the independent directors of the Company.
