Forrestania Resources Limited (ASX: FRS) (“FRS” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce
that it has agreed to revised terms for the option agreement with Outback Minerals Pty Ltd for
the Bonnie Vale and Breakaway Dam projects.
1 ASX: FRS Option to acquire Eastern Goldfields tenements, 16th May 2023
2 ASX: FRS Ada Ann results up to 4m @ 16g/t Au, 24th March 2025
3 ASX: FRS Copper prospectivity at Eastern Goldfields project, 14th September 2023
4 ASX: FRS Breakaway Dam lithium update, 26th February 2024

The extension to the agreement gives the Company a significant amount of time to undertake
further drilling and exploration work at the Bonnie Vale and Breakaway Dam Projects. The
Company has had two strong and successful drilling campaigns at Ada Ann to date1 - helping
to turn the Bonnie Vale project area into an area of high exploration potential.
Pursuant to the revised agreement, the Company may issue the $1.1 million of share
consideration at any time, up until 5th May 2026, based on a 5 day VWAP share price at the
time, subject to a maximum share price of 20 cents per share.
Forrestania Resources’ Chairman John Hannaford commented:
“We are pleased to announce the revised terms for the Option agreement over both the Bonnie
Vale and Breakaway Dam projects. The deferred consideration allows the Company to explore
and assess these key tenement packages with a lot more certainty, and we would like to thank
the vendors, Outback Minerals Pty Ltd for their ongoing support of the Company. This
agreement will allow us to continue exploration of Ada Ann as well as other regional targets at
Bonnie Vale and Breakaway Dam.”

Table 1. All significant drilling intercepts (≥15 grams per metre) from the Ada Ann prospect (including FRS and historic
drilling results). All intercepts are based on a cut-off grade of 0.3g/t Au allowing for internal dilution by two “waste” or
sub-grade (<0.3g/t Au) samples. Drilling intercept widths are down-hole widths and not true widths. Holes in bold have
been drilled by FRS. Samples were fire assayed and full FRS results and details can be seen within the JORC table and the
supplementary data at the end of this announcement.
The extension to the option agreement (over E15/1632 and E15/1534) will ensure that the
Company has more time to confidently and cost effectively continue with the exploration
success at Ada Ann, whilst continuing to potentially grow and confirm the geological and
mineralisation model.

known to have been drilled between AARC0022 and AA14 with no assays available for that hole.

Regional exploration targets at Bonnie Vale
Along with the exploration potential at Ada Ann, the Bonnie Vale Project includes strong,
regional exploration potential for gold, across the project area with multiple, historic drill holes
intersecting gold, none of which have ever been effectively followed up, with mineralisation
still open at all of the targets.
Figure 5. Image showing all of the significant, historic drilling results across the Bonnie Vale Project area and other
anomalous drilling results across the project area. Width given is down-hole width and not true width. Geology
interpretation courtesy of GSWA. For holes BVRB206, BVRB220 and BVRB336, the grades have been averaged over the
length of the mineralisation and the actual corresponding results can be seen in Table 2.
The Bonnie Vale Project area includes multiple, (previously reported567), strong, regional
exploration targets (see Figure 5), including:
 XRB1098 – 2m @ 9.4g/t Au (from 37m), including 1m @ 17.2g/t Au, never effectively
followed up
 KSRC002 – 3m @ 2g/t Au (from 77m), open at depth & along strike
 BVRB327 – 4m @ 0.5g/t Au (from 20m), never followed up

 BVRB326 – 4m @ 0.5g/t Au (from 20m), never followed up
 222g/t Au rock chip (FR001740) – taken in the south of the project area
Along with these strong historic drilling results, other regional results also offer exceptional Au
exploration targets with multiple RAB or AC holes ending in Au mineralisation: BVRB220,
BVRB336 and BVRB327 – all of which are in close proximity to or coincident with the
Kunanalling Shear Zone (KSZ), have never previously been followed up and offer exceptional
exploration targets, with historic (previously reported) results including:
 BVRB336 – with 13 continuous, down-hole metres (from 36m-EOH) of Au
mineralisation >0.1g/t Au – NEVER FOLLOWED UP
 BVRB220 – with 13 continuous, down-hole metres (from 48m-EOH) of Au
mineralisation >0.1g/t Au – NEVER FOLLOWED UP
 BVRB327 – with 8 continuous, down-hole metres (from 16m) of Au mineralisation
>0.1g/t Au, including 4m @ 0.5g/t Au – NEVER FOLLOWED UP
Figure 5 demonstrates the strong, exploration and geological potential and size of the Bonnie
Vale Project – with strong exposure to the Kunanalling Shear Zone (KSZ), a highly fertile,
regional, gold bearing structure which is host to multiple, significant Au resources, reserves and
discoveries as well as exposure to a significant area of potentially mineralised greenstone with
several promising, shallow historic intervals that have been identified from historic RAB
programmes but have never previously been followed up.
The most recent regional exploration drilling (prior to the FRS drilling at Ada Ann) was
completed by Outback Minerals (previously reported) in 2022 (on E15/1534). Outback returned
several intersections of Au mineralisation (from KSRC002 and KSRC003 – see Table 2) as a
result of an RC programme that followed up a historic RAB intersection in BVRB206, also in
Table 2, in close proximity to the KSZ.
Additionally, after a WAMEX review and following the option to acquire E15/19729, the
Company is pleased to confirm that several historic AC (air-core) holes coincident with the KSZ
returned significantly anomalous results for Au within E15/1972; these results were never
followed up and include:
 RSAC103 – 2m @ 0.7g/t Au (from 24m to EOH)
 RSAC102 – 2m @ 0.6g/t Au (from 21m)

KSRC002 and KSRC003) are listed below, in Table 2:

Breakaway Dam Project (E29/1036 & E29/1037), Menzies WA
The Breakaway Dam Project represents a significant opportunity for the Company, with strong
exploration targets for both copper and lithium within the Alexandra Bore greenstone belt.
Historic exploration activity include highly anomalous drilled intercepts of copper2 with
sulphides as well as drilled pegmatites that were never effectively assayed3.
Since commencing the option agreement with Outback Minerals, FRS has completed multiple
desktop studies and field reconnaissance visits and has returned strong, highly anomalous
results for copper and lithium10.
Significant Cu results (previously released) at Breakaway Dam include:
 BDRC10 – 6m @ 1.19% Cu (including 1m @ 3.86% Cu), 11.07g/t Ag (including 1m @
35.7g/t Ag) from 185m, with up to 40% pyrite and pyrrhotite
 BDRC08 – 4m @ 0.29% Cu and 1m @ 0.67% Cu, including 1m @ 3.2g/t Ag, from
36m (end of hole = 70m)
 BD001 – 7m @ 0.15% Cu (including 1m @ 0.51% Cu), 1.63g/t Ag (from 124m), with
up to 20% pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
 BD001 – 2m @ 0.23% Cu (including 1m @ 0.42% Cu) (from 193m), with up to 10%
pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
 BD002 – 2m @ 0.45% Cu (including 1m @ 0.71% Cu) (from 106m), with up to 10%
pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
 BD003 – 8m @ 0.15% Cu (including 1m @ 0.45% Cu, 2m @ 7.35g/t Ag and 1m @
0.38% Pb) (from 145m), with up to 70% pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
 Rock chip - FR000766 – 26.7% Cu, 15.4ppm Ag and 0.5ppm Au
Additionally, previously released historic downhole electro-magnetic (DHEM) survey results
indicate several potentially sulphide-bearing conductive plates, which remain completely untested
by drilling and highly anomalous, historic and recent geochemical results have been returned for
Au, Ag, As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Se and Te which suggest the potential for a VMS copper exploration
target.

Figure 7: Section looking north showing interpreted conductive plates. The plate seen adjacent to BD001 and those adjacent
to BD003 have been interpreted by Southern Geoscience Consultants as potentially sulphide-bearing. These electro-magnetic
plates have never been drill tested.
The Breakaway Dam project is also seen as having a strong potential for lithium with a number
of highly anomalous LCT and LCT pathfinder results returned from pegmatite rock chip sampling.
The results suggest the strong potential for a highly fertile pegmatite system within the
Breakaway Dam project tenements with zones of Li mineralisation up to 1200m in strike length,
with results including:
 FR000832 – 1,695ppm Li (3,649ppm Li O or 0.4% Li O)

As well as the strong geochem returned from multiple field visits, reviews of historic drilling
results from Breakaway Dam highlighted several pegmatite intercepts never previously tested for
lithium, with multiple holes ending in pegmatite (previously reported), including:
 AXR014 – 18m of logged pegmatite to EOH
 AXR013 - 2m of logged pegmatite to EOH
 AXR016 - 4m of logged pegmatite to EOH
 Additionally, other holes were also with logged pegmatite to EOH

 Historical drilling at Ada Ann:
 Holes with AA1-AA51 were completed by RC drilling, 1m samples were laid
on the ground and samples that were thought to be mineralized were sent
for assay, some were composited and some were not; other metre intervals
that were not interpreted to be mineralized were not assayed. Samples are
believed to have been assayed by Aqua Regia techniques at Kalgoorlie
assay laboratories. Laboratory documentation for all the assays is not
available.
 After a review of holes AA1-AA51, Gindalbie Metals sampled intervals not
sampled previously. This sampling was performed by scoop sampling the
bagged individual drill samples still on site, with both individual and
composite samples being taken. It was not possible to riffle split the samples
(as presumably would-have been the case with Stockwell’s original
samples) as many of the samples were cemented into hard masses, some
were wet and the cost of drying pulverising and splitting the samples was
not thought to be warranted. Instead as representative a sample as possible
was obtained by breaking up the samples and scoop sampling throughout
the sample.
 Holes BR1-19 were completed by RAB drilling, drill samples were
collected over a 2m interval, via a cyclone, a representative sample was
taken using a pipe, composited to 6m samples and sent to Genalysis for
fire assay. Historical reports suggest that any sample returning a 6m
composite value >0.1g/t Au had the corresponding 2m samples submitted
to Genalysis for fire assay, but not all of these 2m assays are available.
 Holes BR20-24 were also completed by RAB drilling, one metre samples
were collected and then speared, composited over four metre intervals
and submitted to Genalysis for gold analysis by AAS (50gm charge).
Intervals returning greater than 0.25g/t gold were resampled on a one
metre basis and re-assayed, using the same technique.
 Holes BR25-29 were drilled by RC; one metre samples were collected and
then speared, composited over four metre intervals and submitted to
Genalysis for gold analysis by AAS (50gm charge). Intervals returning
greater than 0.25g/t gold were resampled on a one metre basis and re-
assayed, using the same technique.

appropriate by the logging geologist. BDRC10 has a diamond tail (BD004)
from 214m but the holes is referred to as BDRC10 throughout this
announcement as that is how it has been historically reported; as such, the
samples taken from 214m were taken using quarter core over, 1m sample
intervals. Samples were not taken for the entirety of the diamond tail of
BDRC10 – areas to sample were chosen by the logging geologists, based on
their identification of mineralisation.
 BD holes were sampled using 4m composites over the RC pre collar interval
and were sampled using quarter core over 1m sample intervals. Samples
were not taken for the entirety of these holes – areas to sample were chosen
by the logging geologists, based on their identification of mineralisation.
 AXR holes were completed by RAB drilling.
 OLRAB holes were completed by RAB drilling.
 BDRC holes were assayed for multi elements and gold by ALS with 4
different methodologies: ME-MS41 (aqua regia with ICPMS and ICPAES
finish), Au-ICP21 (Au by fire assay with ICPAES finish), Cu-OG62 (ore grade
Cu by 4 acid with ICPAES finish for the following holes and intervals::
BDRC01 20-21m, BDRC10 186-190m; this methodology was also applied to
the standards used in all holes with a prefix BD0) and Au-TL43 (aqua regia

2010 and 2020 (WAMEX A126038). This was an AC programme, no
details of the rig specifics are available. 4m composite samples were taken
throughout the programme. Samples were sent to Genalysis for gold
analysis by aqua regia as well as 4 acid multi element analysis.
 BDRC holes were sampled using 4m composites over the majority of the
samples. Smaller composites and 1m samples were taken when deemed
appropriate by the logging geologist. BDRC10 has a diamond tail (BD004)
from 214m but the holes is referred to as BDRC10 throughout this
announcement as that is how it has been historically reported; as such, the
samples taken from 214m were taken using quarter core over, 1m sample
intervals. Samples were not taken for the entirety of the diamond tail of
BDRC10 – areas to sample were chosen by the logging geologists, based on
their identification of mineralisation.
 BD holes were sampled using 4m composites over the RC pre collar interval

• For the BR holes: Drill samples over a 2 metre interval were collected via a
cyclone; a representative sample was taken utilising a pipe, composited:
over 6 metres, bagged and submitted to Genalysis to be analysed for gold
using fire assay techniques. Any 6 metre composite sample which
returned an assay value greater than O.1ppm Au was resampled by
collecting the three corresponding 2m samples and submitted to
Genalysis to be analysed for gold using fire assay techniques. No details
of QAQC are given in the WAMEX report but industry standard is

coarse gold nature of the mineralisation, with specks of free gold evident when
logging and also the poor repeatability of some of the higher grade assays.
• P Fey conducted follow up drilling to the BHP drilling in October and November
1988. In the period 23-25 October 1988 five RAB holes (BR20-24) for 210 metres
were drilled with a Mole Pioneer rig from Westralian Diamond Drillers of Boulder.
This rig proved unsatisfactory in the hard ground encountered at relatively shallow
depths and a Warman RC rig was used for holes BRC25-29 totalling 263 metres,
drilled between 16-21 November 1988. For all holes except BR20-21 (2 metre
samples), one metre samples were collected and then speared, composited over
four metre intervals and submitted to Genalysis for gold analysis by AAS (50gm
charge). Intervals returning greater than 0.25g/t gold were resampled on a one
metre basis and re-assayed, using the same technique. Significant gold
mineralisation was found associated with zones of epidotisation and quartz veining
(Fey, 1989). The presence of coarse gold was again demonstrated by the
considerable spread in the value of repeat assays and free gold was again panned.
• This drilling demonstrated that the strike of the flat east dipping shear was in fact
more north-south than the north-easterly direction assumed by BHP.
• In 1993 A Stockwell pegged cancelled GML’s 15/6729 “Ada Ann”, and 15/6718 as
P15/3443 . Stockwell mounted an RC drill programme to follow up intersections
from the BHP and Fey drilling programmes.
• Holes AA01-51 were completed by Stockwell for 1892 metres over the central
portion of the mineralisation, delineated by previous operators. A few holes were
also completed further south near old pits and costeans. None of the holes were
systematically sampled, Stockwell sampling only those portions of the holes he
thought would assay. Samples are believed to have been assayed by Aqua Regia
techniques at Kalgoorlie assay laboratories. Laboratory documentation for all the
assays is not available. This drilling highlighted the presence of steeper quartz vein
hosted mineralisation in the hanging wall of the flat east dipping shear as well as
intersecting mineralisation in the flat shear itself.
• Following completion of the drilling Stockwell commenced a small mining operation
on the steep east dipping quartz veins intersected by the drilling. A small pit was
dug to a depth of six metres from which 150 tonnes averaging 7 g/t Au was treated
at the Kintore mill of M Pavlinovich (pers. comm. A Stockwell).
• Gindalbie completed 7 RC holes for 451m in 1996: AA52-AA58.
• Amex Resources completed further drilling in 2000, 18 RC holes were completed
but AMEX did not confirm the metres drilled and not all details were reported to the

• P Fey conducted follow up drilling to the BHP drilling in October and November
1988. In the period 23-25 October 1988 five RAB holes (BR20-24) for 210 metres
were drilled with a Mole Pioneer rig from Westralian Diamond Drillers of Boulder.
This rig proved unsatisfactory in the hard ground encountered at relatively shallow
depths and a Warman RC rig was used for holes BRC25-29 totalling 263 metres,
drilled between 16-21 November 1988. For all holes except BR20-21 (2 metre
samples), one metre samples were collected and then speared, composited over
four metre intervals and submitted to Genalysis for gold analysis by AAS (50gm
charge). Intervals returning greater than 0.25g/t gold were resampled on a one
metre basis and re-assayed, using the same technique. Significant gold
mineralisation was found associated with zones of epidotisation and quartz veining
(Fey, 1989). The presence of coarse gold was again demonstrated by the
considerable spread in the value of repeat assays and free gold was again panned.
• This drilling demonstrated that the strike of the flat east dipping shear was in fact
more north-south than the north-easterly direction assumed by BHP.
• In 1993 A Stockwell pegged cancelled GML’s 15/6729 “Ada Ann”, and 15/6718 as
P15/3443 . Stockwell mounted an RC drill programme to follow up intersections
from the BHP and Fey drilling programmes.
• Holes AA01-51 were completed by Stockwell for 1892 metres over the central
portion of the mineralisation, delineated by previous operators. A few holes were
also completed further south near old pits and costeans. None of the holes were
systematically sampled, Stockwell sampling only those portions of the holes he
thought would assay. Samples are believed to have been assayed by Aqua Regia
techniques at Kalgoorlie assay laboratories. Laboratory documentation for all the
assays is not available. This drilling highlighted the presence of steeper quartz vein
hosted mineralisation in the hanging wall of the flat east dipping shear as well as
intersecting mineralisation in the flat shear itself.
• Following completion of the drilling Stockwell commenced a small mining operation
on the steep east dipping quartz veins intersected by the drilling. A small pit was
dug to a depth of six metres from which 150 tonnes averaging 7 g/t Au was treated
at the Kintore mill of M Pavlinovich (pers. comm. A Stockwell).
• Gindalbie completed 7 RC holes for 451m in 1996: AA52-AA58.
• Amex Resources completed further drilling in 2000, 18 RC holes were completed
but AMEX did not confirm the metres drilled and not all details were reported to the
ASX.

• At Breakaway Dam, the first indications of exploration were a number of small pits

malachite-coated quartz veining in chloritic schists.
• Systematic exploration commenced in the 1970s when copper, nickel, lead and zinc

arsenic and copper (ppm).
• Follow-up by Delta consisted of a further 270 shallow auger soil samples followed by
drilling of 18 short RAB holes (prefix AXR) totalling 461m. Results indicated the
presence of a number of sinusoidal anomalies, two of which exhibited gold values of
greater than 85ppb Au. These were reported to be “situated within favourable

Balanced reporting | • Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is
not practicable, representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid
misleading reporting of Exploration Results. |  Representative reporting has been made in the body of the announcement and all
assay results have previously been reported.
Other substantive
exploration data | • Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should
be reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating substances. |  At Bonnie Vale:
 WAMEX reports: A49504, A2523, A25113, A28449, A109745, A58256, A62263 and
A54843 were used to confirm data for this report in relation to the Bonnie Vale
project. An additional WAMEX report by Outback Minerals was also used for the
KSRC holes (the WAMEX report number is unknown as it has only recently been
submitted). Also used as reference material and for data: ASX (Amex Resources)
Gold drill intercepts at Ada Ann 8th April 2008.
 At Breakaway Dam:
 WAMEX reports: A55119, A70452, A78230, A81833, A88374, A91577, A109745,
were used to confirm geochemical and drilling data for this report.
 WAMEX reports A88374 and A91577 reference a down hole EM survey that was
completed in 2010, Three DHTEM surveys were completed at the Breakaway Dam
project during mid September 2009 by GEM Geophysical Surveys and interpreted by
