    "description": "<p><strong>VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 15, 2024</strong> / <strong>Relevant Gold Corp. (TSXV:RGC)(OTCQB:RGCCF)</strong> (&quot;<strong>Relevant Gold</strong>&quot; or the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot;) is pleased to announce the Company has entered into a Purchase Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) with Golden Buffalo Mining Company (&quot;GBMC&quot;) to complete the acquisition of 88 BLM mining claims (700 ha) (the &quot;Subject Property&quot;) in the core of the Company's 3,766 hectare Golden Buffalo property in the South Pass Gold Field, Wyoming, USA. The Subject Property was previously held under a lease with option to purchase agreement (&quot;Lease Option&quot;) with GBMC. Pursuant to the Agreement, GBMC will receive (i) 1,500,000 common shares of the Company, (ii) up to three potential milestone payments more particularly described below, and (iii) a 3% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on the Subject Property.</p><p>Pursuant to the success-based milestone payments, GBMC will receive (a) a US$1,000,000 cash payment and 500,000 common shares of the Company upon the completion of a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate exceeding one million ounces of gold on the Subject Property, (b) a US$1,000,000 cash payment upon filing by the Company of a NI 43-101 compliant Feasibility Study for the Subject Property; and (c) a US$9,000,000 cash payment upon the commencement of commercial production of the Subject Property or any portion thereof.</p><p>The Purchase Agreement eliminates the four remaining US$300,000 annual lease payments and replaces the US$15,000,000 purchase price specified in the original Lease Option by issuing 1,500,000 common shares of the Company. Milestone payments are success-based and paid upon achieving each milestone. The NSR remains unchanged from the original Lease Option. 2% of the NSR can be repurchased for US$5,000,000.</p><p><i>&quot;This agreement represents a big win for Relevant Gold in both the short and long-term, allowing us to minimize our burn rate and safeguarding our flagship Golden Buffalo asset. The restructuring moves $16.2M of calendar-triggered payments to success-based milestones,&quot; said Relevant Gold CEO Rob Bergmann. &quot;As a bonus, we get to bring two incredible operators onto the team, both of whom are now entirely aligned with the Company's goals, and who will greatly strengthen our connection to local communities and day-to-day operations.&quot;</i></p><p>The 3,766 hectare Golden Buffalo property is one of the Company's two flagship assets and has returned rock chip assays from trenching highlighted by <strong>168 g/t Au, </strong>followed up in 2022 by a top drilling intercept of<strong> 83.8 g/t Au over 1 metre</strong> in the first ever drilling program where <strong>54% of drill holes</strong> from the 3,500 metre program intersected shear-hosted gold mineralization (see <a href=\"https://pr.report/eaIl4XMz\">Feb. 06, 2023 Press Release</a>).</p><p><strong><u>Technical Team Appointments</u></strong></p><p>In addition to the Agreement, the Company is excited to announce the principals at GBMC will be joining the Relevant Gold team and fill two critical roles: (i) Jerome Hutchison will serve as Communities Advisor and Site Manager and, (ii) Jacob Tyra will serve as Operations Manager. As part of the service agreement, Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Tyra will each be issued 150,000 common share options at an exercise price of $0.20. These options will vest over 12 months and expire on January 09, 2027.</p><p><strong>Jerome Hutchison - Community Advisor and Site Manager</strong></p><p>Mr. Hutchison was born and raised in Riverton, Wyo., and has lived, worked, and established businesses in Riverton and around the state. He formed a start-up company and grew it to an independent franchise with four storefronts throughout the state. Mr. Hutchison is active in the community, serving on multiple homeowner's boards, church boards, athletic boards, and city committees. He started GBMC in 2019 with the acquisition of a gold-rich property in South Pass.
