# Alaska Energy Metals Advances Core Asset Focus With Sale of Mexico Subsidiary and Shareholding

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC, OTCQB: AKEMF) (“AEMC” or the “Company”) today announced:  


  1. The sale of its shareholding in Felix Gold Ltd. (ASX: FXG) (“Felix Gold”), and
  2. The sale of its Mexico subsidiary, Recursos Millrock S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Recursos Millrock”).



As a result of these sales, AEMC added non-dilutive capital to its balance sheet.

“ _We have strategically re-built our asset portfolio to enhance our long-term sustainability and maintain focus on our Nikolai Nickel Project_ ,” says Gregory Beischer, CEO of Alaska Energy Metals. “ _These sales allow us to realize value for these non-core assets. Alaska Energy Metals owns other gold property assets in Alaska that it may also consider selling._ ”

**Felix Gold Shares**  
The Company sold the Felix Gold shares it received in 2022 as partial payment for its gold projects in the Fairbanks Gold District in Alaska. Proceeds from the sale amount to CAD$350,000 net of brokerage and currency exchange fees.

**Mexico Subsidiary**  
The Company has completed the sale of its Mexico subsidiary, Recursos Millrock, to Grupo Minero Factor S.A. de C.V., a private company based in Chihuahua, Mexico. Consideration for the purchase was the grant of royalty interests in 12 mining concessions that were held by Recursos Millrock. Of particular note is the 0.5% royalty on the Higuerita concession, which comprises the El Batamote porphyry copper project. Grupo Factor must offer to return the concessions to the Company in the event they decide to abandon them. The royalties are summarized in the table below. The Company may consider the sale of these royalty interests in the future.
