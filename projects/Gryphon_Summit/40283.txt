# Reyna Silver and Reyna Gold Announce Signing of Option Agreement for Gryphon Project in Nevada

_**NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES OR FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES.**_

**VANCOUVER, BC and HONG KONG, CHINA / ACCESSWIRE / September 5, 2023 / Reyna Silver Corp. (TSXV:RSLV)(OTCQX:RSNVF)(FRA:4ZC)**("**Reyna Silver** ") and **Reyna Gold Corp. (TSXV:REYG)(OTCQB:REYFG)**("**Reyna Gold** ")**** are pleased to announce that they have entered into a Property Option Agreement (the "**Agreement** ") with Golden Gryphon USA Inc. ("**Gryphon** ") on the Gryphon Summit Project (the "**Project** ") located in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada. The Project comprises 1286 unpatented and 8 patented lode mining claims located in the Diablo Range, which lies in an area of excellent infrastructure between the Carlin and Eureka-Battle Trends of north-central Nevada.

The 10,300-hectare Gryphon project covers 8 by 16 kilometres of ground laced by well-developed, variably mineralized structures. The structures show strong evidence of having sequentially controlled multiple mineralizing events, including Carlin-style Gold; Silver, Lead, Zinc, Copper, Gold Carbonate Replacement veins (CRDs); and stratabound Nickel-Zinc mineralization (See Figure 2). This style of overlapping mineralizing events is a key element of significant deposits like Ruby Hill, which lies just 70 km along trend southeast of the Gryphon project in the famous Eureka District, now known for its overlapping Carlin-style gold and historic CRD Pb-Zn-Ag deposits (See Figure 1). In addition, the Gryphon project contains an interpreted stratabound Nickel-Zinc sequence, providing a critical mineral opportunity in one of the best jurisdictions in the world (See Figure 3).

Historic exploration at Gryphon Summit was by Majors who focused on the gold and undertook extensive geological, geochemical, and geophysical programs. These resulted in localized shallow drilling programs, several of which showed strong results that were never followed up. Golden Gryphon Exploration subsequently recognized multiple superimposed silver-lead-zinc-copper and nickel mineralization events combined with a possible porphyry driver. Reyna Silver and Reyna Gold plan to deploy the first-ever integrated ore-systems approach here to unravel the individual components of this large, composite district-scale project.

"Reyna Silver's strength is the ability to take on large, district-scale projects. The multiple overprinted silver, gold and nickel events seen here and increasingly by others in the immediate neighborhood suggests Gryphon fits perfectly into our wheelhouse," said Jorge Ramiro Monroy, CEO of Reyna Silver. "We're delighted to team with our sister company Reyna Gold on this precious metals-rich multistage property smack dab in the middle of one of the world's best-understood gold mega-districts."

"We are excited by the opportunity to expand into this new jurisdiction with shared talents and capital. Our geological team has considerable expertise in Carlin Gold deposits we can bring to bear," said Michael Wood, CEO of Reyna Gold. "The investment structure of the deal allows us to build systematically on existing work, and the joint venture provides our shareholders jurisdictional diversity through exposure to a district-scale property in the U.S., complementing our La Gloria project in Mexico."

"It's remarkable when the opportunity arises to acquire an exploration project on Main Street for both the Carlin Gold and Eureka-Ruby Hill CRD trends, especially one with a huge inventory of high quality but underutilized exploration data," noted Dr. Peter Megaw, Chief Exploration Advisor to Reyna Silver. "Gryphon is just across the valley from i80 Gold's Ruby Hill, where the two major regional mineralization styles are co-mingled, creating some pretty special mining economics."

**The Agreement:**

The Agreement gives Reyna Silver and Reyna Gold, jointly, the ability to earn up to a 70% equity interest in the Project (the "**Option** "). Reyna Silver and Reyna Gold have formed an unincorporated joint venture for the purpose of holding the Option (the "**Reyna JV** ")**.** The Option is subject to the Reyna JV performing the following by April 30, 2027: (i) expending a total of US$9,500,000 on the Project; (ii) making cash payments to Gryphon in the aggregate amount of US$1,100,000; and (iii) issuing a total of 1,200,000 common shares in the capital of Reyna Silver and 1,200,000 common shares in the capital of Reyna Gold to Gryphon. Upon completion of the Option, Gryphon and Reyna JV will enter a joint venture to continue exploration and development of the Project. See below for the detailed terms.

Reyna Silver and Reyna Gold already share a number of technical team members and advisors; for efficiency, Reyna Silver will assume the technical lead of the Gryphon Summit project. Reyna Gold will contribute both capital and their gold expertise, including advisor Tony Longo, whose experience in Carlin-style Deposits will significantly benefit the project. The structure of the agreement is designed with the intent to focus funds for the first two years into the ground for exploration.

**The Project**

The project lies in the Basin and Range province of Nevada between the Battle Mountain-Eureka and Carlin trends, along the eastern boundary of the Roberts Mountain Thrust. This area's NS to NNW high-angle horst-graben structures provided excellent pathways for mineralizing fluids generated by a series of metallogenic events. Calcareous lithologies dominate the geologic sequence, including limestone, dolostone and calcareous shale, as well as clastics and quartzite. Particular rock units of interest include the Pogonip Group (the host rock for the Carlin-style mineralization in Eureka), Devil's Gate Limestone (a major host for Eureka CRD mineralization), and the Vinini Formation (a major host for gold mineralization in the Horse Canyon Carlin Gold mine).

Figure 1. Gryphon Summit is located in Northeastern Nevada, 70 km NW of the Eureka district and 54 km from Carlin. The project is 73 km west of Reyna Silver's Medicine Springs CRD Project.

Gryphon Summit exhibits both the key features indicative of a Carlin-style system and at least 8 out of the 13 key features associated with major CRDs (See Figure 5). Extensive systematic sampling revealed gold grades up to 15-24 g/t Au, silver grades up to 300-2060 g/t Ag, nickel grades up to 0.2-0.4% Ni, and zinc grades up to 3-35% Zn (See Figures 2 and 3). The exceptional zinc grades concentrate along structures and associate with stratiform Ni-Zn mineralization (See Figure 3).

Exploration will build on extensive earlier work conducted by Golden Gryphon Exploration (GGE) or their prior optionees, including 133 RC holes (11,620 m with most under 100 m depth. We have complete data for 73 of these holes), 11 core holes (4862 m), and most recently, Agnico Eagle's 12 diamond drill holes (2987 m; 250 m average depth) (See Figure 4). In addition, the Reynas inherit over USD$2,000,000 of geochemical and geophysical data, including over 3,000 analyzed rock samples with a curated reference sample library, magnetic, gravimetric, 39 km of IP, CSAMT, and 17 km of NSAMT geophysics. The project is crossed by 35 km of well-maintained roads connecting all the key areas and existing permitted drill targets.

These combined elements make Gryphon primed for the Reyna's disciplined, systematic, ore-systems approach to exploration.

The terms of the NSR Agreement will be negotiated on or before April 30, 2025.

The Agreement is subject to (i) a 30-day due diligence period in favour of Reyna JV and (ii) acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.
