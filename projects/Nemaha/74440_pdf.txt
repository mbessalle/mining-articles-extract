__________________________________________________________________________________
HyTerra Ltd (ASX:HYT) (“HyTerra” or the “Company”) via its 100% owned and operated
subsidiary HYT Operating LLC, has acquired a significant leasing position in Nemaha Project,
Kansas. Approximately 13,000 acres have been acquired bringing the total lease position from
39,000 acres to approximately 52,000 acres. Infill leasing will continue.
Targeted leasing supported by geophysical data
The selection of the new leasing area is based on subsurface features identified in multiple
reprocessed seismic lines. These features are related to both the Mid-Continent Rift and
overlying sedimentary rocks which reveal drilling targets. This provides additional play diversity
to support the expanded drilling program linked to the Fortescue subscription agreement to
be voted on by shareholders at an upcoming general meeting (“EGM”).
The Nemaha Project now covers an area defined by the Mid-Continent Rift System to the west
and the prominent Nemaha Ridge to the east, the highest structural feature in the region.
Numerous historic hydrogen occurrences in this area are believed to originate from the iron-
rich rocks within the Rift.
Executive Director, Dr Avon McIntyre, said that acquiring exploration leases in this area has
been a high priority for the company.
“The subsurface team at HyTerra identified this area earlier in the year as being particularly
prospective for hydrogen and helium and we acquired some legacy seismic data in the area to
assist us in selecting the right leases to acquire. Reprocessing of this seismic data has had a
huge uplift in imaging quality and has revealed great candidates for our upcoming drilling
campaign, which we are progressing now for additional drilling locations.”

Fortescue strategic investment EGM update
HyTerra expects the Independent Expert’s Report in respect of Fortescue’s strategic
investment, which is required to be provided to shareholders as part of the notice of meeting
for the EGM, to be finalised by the end of October. As a result, the EGM is now expected to
be held in December 2024. Fortescue and HyTerra have agreed to extend the end date for
shareholder approval in light of the revised EGM date. The currently planned drilling campaign
will commence as soon as practicable following the EGM.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors.

HyTerra. A World of Opportunity.
Exploring for natural hydrogen and helium resources near major industrial hubs. White hydrogen's
potential as a low-carbon feedstock or fuel has spurred millions in new investment and created a world rich
with opportunities for first movers.
HyTerra was the first company to
list on the ASX with a focus on
white hydrogen, which is
generated naturally by the Earth.
White hydrogen potentially has
much lower production costs
and carbon emissions than man-
made hydrogen.
Our Nemaha Project in Kansas,
USA, holds 100% owned and
operated leases across the
emerging Nemaha Ridge natural
hydrogen and helium play
fairway. Our Geneva Project in
Nebraska, USA, is a 16% earn-in
interest in a Joint Development
with Natural Hydrogen Energy
LLC targeting natural hydrogen
and helium.
Both projects could be connected via existing transport infrastructure to multiple nearby off-takers, including
ammonia manufacturers, and petrochemical plants.
