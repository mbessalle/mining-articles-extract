ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
HyTerra triples lease acreage on Nemaha Project
Continuing to build a significant lease position pre-drill
___________________________________________________________________________________
• Approximately 26,200 acres have been acquired at Nemaha Project bringing
the total exploration lease position from 12,880 to approximately 39,000 acres
• The leases are in the highly prospective Washington and Marshall Counties
above the Mid-Continent Rift which is considered to be the generation zone
for hydrogen
• Infill leasing, leasing of new exploration areas, and securing additional well
permits continues
• Preparation for an EGM for shareholders to vote on the $21.9m Fortescue
strategic interest in HyTerra is on track
__________________________________________________________________________________
HyTerra Ltd (ASX:HYT) (“HyTerra” or the “Company”) via its 100% owned and operated
subsidiary HYT Operating LLC, has acquired a significant leasing position in Nemaha Project,
Kansas. Approximately 26,200 acres have been acquired bringing the total exploration lease
position from 12,880 acres to approximately 39,000 acres.
Additional Geological Play added to the Portfolio
The new leases provide an additional geological play to HyTerra’s drilling portfolio, as they are
situated above a major geological feature known as the Mid-Continent Rift. The Mid-Continent
Rift is a ~1 billion-year-old failed tectonic rift containing significant quantities of iron-rich
minerals. These minerals are considered to be ideal candidates for the generation of hydrogen
when they interact and react with water in subsurface aquifers. Thus, the new acreage is in a
location close to the proposed zone of hydrogen generation. Additional prospectivity is inferred
by structural lineaments marking the northern extent of the Mid-Continent Rift in Kansas,
increasing the likelihood of trapping features in this area.

Washington and Marshall Counties (North) and existing leases in Morris, Geary, Riley and
Wabaunsee Counties (South).
The Nemaha Project now covers an area defined by the Mid-Continent Rift System to the west
and the prominent Nemaha Ridge to the east, the highest structural feature in the region.
Numerous historic hydrogen occurrences in this area are believed to originate from the iron-
rich rocks within the Rift. The hydrogen generated from this source is thought to migrate
upward along faults, towards the crest of the Nemaha Ridge.

across the acreage portfolio.
Executive Director, Dr Avon McIntyre, explained the importance of the new acreage and
thanked HyTerra’s Kansas-based leasing team for their efforts in securing this acreage.
“Securing significant acreage right now prior to the upcoming drilling is key for value addition
to shareholders. In anticipation of a positive outcome at the upcoming EGM vote on Fortescue’s
39.8% strategic interest acquisition in HyTerra which includes funding for a 6 well drilling
program, we will continue to infill lease in the area and work up drillable locations over the
coming weeks to add to our growing portfolio of geologically diverse drilling targets.”
“Our predictive model for white hydrogen and helium in Kansas highlighted this area as being
particularly prospective and we are very pleased to execute in record time. This was only
possible through funds raised earlier this year and the sterling efforts of our local Kansas-based
leasing team who have been able to help us triple our acreage position in less than two months.
We are currently pursuing new areas to lease based on more identified prospectivity in the
area.”
Fortescue strategic investment EGM update
HyTerra has engaged Stantons to assist with the preparation of an Independent Experts Report
(IER) to be included in the required Notice of Meeting (NOM) for an EGM (Extraordinary
General Meeting) at which shareholders can vote on Fortescue’s proposed $21.9m strategic
investment in HyTerra. Stantons have engaged RISC to provide an Independent Technical
Specialist Report (ITSR) on HyTerra’s projects to support the IER. As announced by the
Company on August 29th, the EGM is expected to be held on or before November 11th, 2024.
The currently planned drilling campaign is postponed until after the finalisation of the
Subscription, expected in Q4 2024.

HyTerra. A World of Opportunity.
Exploring for natural hydrogen and helium resources near major industrial hubs. White hydrogen's
potential as a low-carbon feedstock or fuel has spurred millions in new investment and created a world rich
with opportunities for first movers.
HyTerra was the first company to list on the ASX
with a focus on white hydrogen, which is
generated naturally by the Earth. White hydrogen
potentially has much lower production costs and
carbon emissions than man-made hydrogen.
Our Nemaha Project in Kansas, USA, holds 100%
owned and operated leases across the emerging
Nemaha Ridge natural hydrogen and helium play
fairway. Our Geneva Project in Nebraska, USA,
is a 16% earn-in interest in a Joint Development
with Natural Hydrogen Energy LLC targeting
natural hydrogen and helium.
Both projects could be connected via existing
transport infrastructure to multiple nearby off-
takers, including ammonia manufacturers, and
petrochemical plants.
