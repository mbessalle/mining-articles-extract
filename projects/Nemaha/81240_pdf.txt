ASX ANNOUNCEMENT

• Three additional well permits approved by Regulator
• Drilling site earth works to start on maiden Nemaha Project well Blythe 13-20
___________________________________________________________________________________
Nemaha Project, Kansas | 100% Working Interest
HyTerra Ltd (ASX:HYT) (“HyTerra” or the “Company”) via its 100% owned and operated
subsidiary HYT Operating LLC, has continued leasing within several priority areas in the Nemaha
Project, Kansas. Approximately 8,000 acres have been acquired bringing the total lease position
from 52,000 acres to over 60,000 acres. This position supports the upcoming significant
exploration campaign.
The Kansas Corporation Commission has approved a further three well permits: Downey Ranch
13-31 in Wabaunsee County, Crome 1-28 in Marshall County and Larson 1-14 in Riley County.
Each of these prospects are based on existing and recently purchased gravity, magnetic and
seismic data.
The drilling contractor has advised that preparation of the drill site earthworks and access road
starts this week at the Blythe 13-10 prospect location.
Geneva Project, Nebraska | 16% Working Interest
Neutralysis (a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company) and Natural Hydrogen Energy LLC
(NH2E) are assessing options for future activities under the Joint Development and Earn-In
Agreement (JDA). After the downhole pump failed during testing in 2023, activities ceased with
Neutralysis stopping earning into this project and has remained at a 16% interest. The joint
development partners are awaiting the provision of key data and metrics to decide on flow testing
operations and the work program going forward. Neutralysis has been informed by NH2E that it
has appointed new management, and as a result Neutralysis believes the venture may be better
placed to reach critical decision points. The outcomes will form part of a quality decision by
Neutralysis on the viability of this venture.
Once a venture decision is taken, the Board of HyTerra will update the market accordingly.

This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors.

HyTerra. A World of Opportunity.
Exploring for natural hydrogen and helium resources near major industrial hubs. White hydrogen's
potential as a low-carbon feedstock or fuel has spurred millions in new investment and created a world
rich with opportunities for first movers.
HyTerra was the first company
to list on the ASX with a focus on
white hydrogen, which is
generated naturally by the Earth.
White hydrogen potentially has
much lower production costs
and carbon emissions than man-
made hydrogen.
Our Nemaha Project in Kansas,
USA, holds 100% owned and
operated leases across the
emerging Nemaha Ridge natural
hydrogen and helium play
fairway. Our Geneva Project in
Nebraska, USA, is a 16% earn-in
interest in a Joint Development
with Natural Hydrogen Energy
LLC targeting natural hydrogen
and helium.
Both projects could be connected via existing transport infrastructure to multiple nearby off-takers,
including ammonia manufacturers, and petrochemical plants.
