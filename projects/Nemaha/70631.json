Approximately 26,200 acres have been acquired bringing the total exploration lease position from 12,880 acres to approximately 39,000 acres. Additional Geological Play added to the Portfolio The new leases provide an additional geological play to HyTerra’s drilling portfolio, as they are situated above a major geological feature known as the Mid-Continent Rift. The Mid-Continent Rift is a ~1 billion-year-old failed tectonic rift containing significant quantities of iron-rich minerals. These minerals are considered to be ideal candidates for the generation of hydrogen when they interact and react with water in subsurface aquifers. Thus, the new acreage is in a location close to the proposed zone of hydrogen generation. Additional prospectivity is inferred by structural lineaments marking the northern extent of the Mid-Continent Rift in Kansas, increasing the likelihood of trapping features in this area.

The Nemaha Project now covers an area defined by the Mid-Continent Rift System to the west and the prominent Nemaha Ridge to the east, the highest structural feature in the region. Numerous historic hydrogen occurrences in this area are believed to originate from the iron- rich rocks within the Rift. The hydrogen generated from this source is thought to migrate upward along faults, towards the crest of the Nemaha Ridge. 2",
