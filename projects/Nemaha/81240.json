Update on HyTerra’s Projects * HyTerra improves its acreage position to over 60,000 acres in Nemaha Project e Three additional well permits approved by Regulator « Drilling site earth works to start on maiden Nemaha Project well Blythe 13-20 Nemaha Project, Kansas | 100% Working Interest HyTerra Ltd (ASX:HYT) (“HyTerra” or the “Company”) via its 100% owned and operated subsidiary HYT Operating LLC, has continued leasing within several priority areas in the Nemaha Project, Kansas. Approximately 8,000 acres have been acquired bringing the total lease position from 52,000 acres to over 60,000 acres. This position supports the upcoming significant exploration campaign. The Kansas Corporation Commission has approved a further three well permits: Downey Ranch 13-31 in Wabaunsee County, Crome 1-28 in Marshall County and Larson 1-14 in Riley County. Each of these prospects are based on existing and recently purchased gravity, magnetic and seismic data. The drilling contractor has advised that preparation of the drill site earthworks and access road starts this week at the Blythe 13-10 prospect location. Geneva Project, Nebraska | 16% Working Interest Neutralysis (a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company) and Natural Hydrogen Energy LLC (NH2E) are assessing options for future activities under the Joint Development and Earn-In Agreement (JDA). After the downhole pump failed during testing in 2023, activities ceased with Neutralysis stopping earning into this project and has remained at a 16% interest. The joint development partners are awaiting the provision of key data and metrics to decide on flow testing operations and the work program going forward. Neutralysis has been informed by NH2E that it has appointed new management, and as a result Neutralysis believes the venture may be better placed to reach critical decision points. The outcomes will form part of a quality decision by Neutralysis on the viability of this venture. Once a venture decision is taken, the Board of HyTerra will update the market accordingly.
