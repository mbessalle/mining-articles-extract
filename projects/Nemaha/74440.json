Approximately 13,000 acres have been acquired bringing the total lease position from 39,000 acres to approximately 52,000 acres. Infill leasing will continue. Targeted leasing supported by geophysical data The selection of the new leasing area is based on subsurface features identified in multiple reprocessed seismic lines. These features are related to both the Mid-Continent Rift and overlying sedimentary rocks which reveal drilling targets. This provides additional play diversity to support the expanded drilling program linked to the Fortescue subscription agreement to be voted on by shareholders at an upcoming general meeting (“EGM”). The Nemaha Project now covers an area defined by the Mid-Continent Rift System to the west and the prominent Nemaha Ridge to the east, the highest structural feature in the region. Numerous historic hydrogen occurrences in this area are believed to originate from the iron- rich rocks within the Rift. Executive Director, Dr Avon Mcintyre, said that acquiring exploration leases in this area has been a high priority for the company. “The subsurface team at HyTerra identified this area earlier in the year as being particularly prospective for hydrogen and helium and we acquired some legacy seismic data in the area to assist us in selecting the right leases to acquire. Reprocessing of this seismic data has had a huge uplift in imaging quality and has revealed great candidates for our upcoming drilling campaign, which we are progressing now for additional drilling locations.”  ® HYTERRA Fortescue strategic investment EGM update HyTerra expects the Independent Expert's Report in respect of Fortescue’s strategic investment, which is required to be provided to shareholders as part of the notice of meeting for the EGM, to be finalised by the end of October. As a result, the EGM is now expected to be held in December 2024. Fortescue and HyTerra have agreed to extend the end date for shareholder approval in light of the revised EGM date. The currently planned drilling campaign will commence as soon as practicable following the EGM. This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors.
