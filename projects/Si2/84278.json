Si2 hosts an early-stage epithermal gold system within the Walker Lane Trend which K2 believes represents a strong exploration analogue to the recent 13.3Moz Silicon discovery. Highlights The alteration study determined that an intact low sulphidation epithermal gold system is present on the Si2 property, with the most prospective horizons occurring within and adjacent to fault structures below the depth of current drilling. The alteration mineralogy indicates potential for higher-tenor gold mineralization slightly deeper than the current extent of drilling.
