Mr. Peter Batten, Managing Director, commented on the progress: “Haranga is fortunate to have the opportunity to develop an advanced gold project in a Tier 1 gold province. The Mother Lode is famous for its high grades and for being at the centre of the famous California Gold Rush. The project includes advanced infrastructure, and we have begun preparations that will allow Haranga to hit the ground running, and commence drilling as soon as practicable after the acquisition is completed. Importantly, Haranga has conducted a site visit, that included meetings with local authorities and consultants, to confirm the permitting status, the environment regulatory framework, and local support for the Lincoln Gold Project. Mines along strike attest to the project's potential. Many of these mines extend more than 1,000 metres below the surface (compared to the 150 metre depth of drilling at Lincoln and Comet). Historic production rates of well over 1,000 ounces of gold",
