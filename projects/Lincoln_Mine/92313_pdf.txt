The Lincoln Gold Mine is near production-ready with all major approvals secured1. Conditional
Use Permits were granted by Amador County in 2007 and are perpetual. These allow 315,000
tonnes of ore per year to be processed with the ability to apply for amendments to increase
this amount as the in-situ gold inventory increases
• Unrivalled District-Scale Expansion Potential
The granted Conditional Use Permit places Haranga in a superior position to build its land bank
over dormant mines along the Mother Lode
• ~8.4 Moz gold1,5 produced from Jackson-Plymouth segment of the Mother Lode
About half of the gold produced from the Mother Lode came from the left lateral jog between
the towns of Jackson and Plymouth.
The Lincoln Gold Mine lease package covers half of this segment and provides a commanding
position of this Tier 1 gold region
• Path to JORC Resources & Production
The Company’s goal is to define at least +1 Million ounces of high-grade gold and execute
a mine plan for large-scale production

Haranga Resources Limited (ASX: HAR; FRA: 65E0; "Haranga" or "the Company") is
pleased to report the Company has entered into an agreement with Seduli Holdings
(Australia) Ltd (Seduli) to acquire 100% of the equity of Seduli Sutter Operations
Corporation, the owner of the Lincoln Gold Mine (Lincoln Gold Project) located in Sutter
Creek in California, USA .
Mr. Peter Batten, Managing Director, commented on the progress:
“Haranga is fortunate to have the opportunity to develop an advanced gold project
in a Tier 1 gold province. The Mother Lode is famous for its high grades and for
being at the centre of the famous California Gold Rush.
The project includes advanced infrastructure, and we have begun preparations that
will allow Haranga to hit the ground running, and commence drilling as soon as
practicable after the acquisition is completed.
Importantly, Haranga has conducted a site visit, that included meetings with local
authorities and consultants, to confirm the permitting status, the environment
regulatory framework, and local support for the Lincoln Gold Project.
Mines along strike attest to the project’s potential. Many of these mines extend more
than 1,000 metres below the surface (compared to the 150 metre depth of drilling
at Lincoln and Comet). Historic production rates of well over 1,000 ounces of gold
Page 2 of 43

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
per vertical metre demonstrate the potential value of these gold deposits and the
potential to expand the resources at the project is significant.
Extensions to known deposits are possible both along strike and down dip, not to
mention the possibility of repetitions at depth. There is also potential to extend
resources at other mines within the licence area (South Spring Hill, Medean, Eureka,
for example).
The granted Conditional Use Permit will also be an advantage when seeking
opportunities to expand our footprint along the Mother Lode where there has been
limited, or no modern exploration, especially at sites that were closed to aid
America’s war efforts in the 1940’s. Haranga is looking forward to taking this golden
opportunity”.

Project Overview
The Lincoln Gold Project is in Amador County, approximately 60 km southeast of
Sacramento in Central California (Figure 1). It covers a strike length of the Mother Lode of
approximately 5.8 km between the towns of Sutter Creek and Amador City and consists of
47 property parcels through a combination of ownership and lease agreements for mineral
and surface rights, totalling 322 hectares (Appendix 3).

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Figure 1: Project is located Southeast of Sacramento, California, USA1. Several significant
mines run by US Mine Corporation are active around Ione, where Heavy Mineral
Concentrate, Clay and Silica is produced from three separate operations.
History of the Mother Lode
The California gold rush started in 1849, with the discovery of gold at Sutter Mill. Initial
production was predominantly from placer deposits but with about five years these were
largely depleted. Production then mostly came from lode (quartz vein) deposits until the
industry was closed in the early 1940’s by the Federal Government, so labour could be
redirected to the war effort. The Central Eureka Mine re-opened after World War II and
stayed in production until 1958 (Figure 2). Central Eureka, Wildman and Mahoney, South
Spring Hill and Keystone all had large resources reported in place at the time of their
closure.5

History of the Lincoln Gold Project
The Lincoln Gold Project is located within the Jackson-Plymouth segment of the Mother
Lode (Figure 1 and Figure 2). About half of the gold produced from the Mother Lode came
from this segment. At the same time approximately ~3.4 million ounces of gold has been
produced from the project area itself (Table 1).

Table 1: Summary of gold production within the Project area. Mines are listed from North to
South (after Tietz et al., 2015).
The Lincoln, Comet, and Medean (aka Keystone) deposits are blind and were discovered in
the early 1980’s by drilling that was testing soil geochemical anomalies. In 1989, an 880
metre-long exploration decline was mined through Comet to conduct further drilling, with
sampling and mapping from underground. Between 1983 and 2013, 336 holes, for a total
of 34,771 m, were drilled (Figure 3 and Drillhole Tables Appendix 1).
Drilling at the project to date has been confined to the upper part of the Mother Lode
structure and there are no holes exceeding 150 vertical metres below the surface, meaning
the deposit is open beyond this. The significance of this for exploration potential is
highlighted by historic mines along strike, like Central Eureka, extending beyond 1,400m
below the surface (Table 1).

Eleven resource estimation studies have been completed at the project using varying
methodologies and cutoff grades. The most recent was prepared in 2015 in which most of
the deposit was classified as an inferred resource reflecting drill hole spacing and quality
control issues from some of the older drilling (Table 2). Additional surface and underground
drilling has been completed since then and this data will be incorporated into future mineral
resource estimates.

Numerous metallurgical test programs have been conducted focusing on comminution,
gravity, flotation, cyanidation and tailing treatment. Testing indicated recoveries ranging
from 64% to 99%, depending on the processing methods and the nature of the ore. The
variance between duplicate analyses was typically high and attributed to the presence of
coarse particulate gold.
Recent desktop work has included a compilation and validation of historic data, mapping
of the geology over the Mother Lode and three-dimensional mapping of quartz veins and
shear zones within the resource areas. There has not been any mining since the reporting
of the 2015 estimate.

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Regional Geology
The Mother Lode is a 190 km long belt of gold deposits in the Western Foothills of the Sierra
Nevada Mountain Range. The regional geology defines an accretionary orogen formed
when Triassic volcanic arcs docked onto the western margin of North America in the mid-
Jurassic. Gold mineralisation occurred in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.
Project Geology
The project geology consists of a sequence of steeply ENE-dipping late Jurassic
metasedimentary and metavolcanic units. Gold deposits are located where the regional-
scale Melones and Gold fault zones that are subparallel stratigraphy traverse metavolcanic
units and slates of the Mariposa Formation.
Three deformation events have been identified in the project area. Gold mineralisation
occurred in the second event that formed a regional crenulation cleavage and the Gold
Fault Zone, which as its name suggests, is associated with all of the major gold deposits in
the region.
Deposit Geology
Gold deposits in this part of the Mother Lode are associated with the Gold Fault Zone and
classified as Orogenic Lode deposits.
Mineralisation occurred late in the deformation history during folding of the host shear
zones. The gold lodes have pinch and swell shapes reflecting intersecting shear zones that
predate gold mineralisation and localised high-grade gold shoots within the deposits. The
swell part of the deposit can be upwards of 6 m wide and are defined by complex vein
arrays. The pinch zones contain more discrete veins.
The gold deposits are hosted within a sequence of metamorphosed basaltic to andesitic
flows and tuffs and minor mafic intrusive units (Figures 4 and 5). They consist of quartz-
ankerite vein arrays, with trace sulphides and free-gold within shear zone that traverse the
host stratigraphy (Photograph 2 and Figures 4 and 5). In places there are sulphide selvages
to the veins, referred to as “Gray Ore”, which lower grade than the nearby vein arrays (Tietz
et al., 20152).
There are three known resource areas in the project area: Lincoln, Comet, and Keystone
(Medean/South Spring Hill). The Lincoln and Comet deposits are separated by less than
200m and are discussed together. Mineralisation continues between Lincoln and Comet
but is insufficiently defined to date and represents an underexplored zone of interest. The
three deposits are roughly northwest-striking, but have different dips. The Lincoln deposit
dips moderately- to steeply- southwest, Comet is steeply southwest-dipping and Keystone
(Medean/South Spring Hill) dips 60° to the east.
Some of 38 individual gold-bearing quartz-ankerite veins have been identified in the
Lincoln and Comet deposit, however the bulk of the resource is within five of them. The
veins located in localised shears zones with the Brower Creek metavolcanics, which is a 50-
70 m wide basalt unit with black shale to the southwest and foliated tuffs to the north-east
(Figures 4, and 5). The veins have a pinch and swell shape, varying in width from 0.3 to 1.2
m.
Page 8 of 43

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Ore shoots within the Lincoln-Comet resource area are spatially associated with the margins
of the fault blocks particularly east-dipping faults that segment the blocks, as well as the
occurrence of mafic tuffs (Payne 2008). There is evidence that the ore shoots within the
Lincoln and Comet orebodies are gently plunging to sub-horizontal, in contrast to the sub-
vertical plunge observed in most Mother Lode deposits.

Keystone (Medean/South Spring Hill) Deposits
The Keystone resource is 600m north of Comet (Figure 6) and consists of the Medean and
South Spring Hill veins.
(Not to scale)
Figure 6: Leapfrog image of mineralised zones for Lincoln-Comet and Keystone (South
Spring Hill).
These veins are hosted by shear zones within the Gold Fault Zone close to the contact
between the meta volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequence and the underlying Brower Creek
Member volcanics.
The Medean Vein is easternmost and located along the contact between slate and mafic
volcanics. It is north-northwest-striking and there are minor veins in both its hanging wall
and footwall. The South Spring Hill Vein is 60m southwest of the Medean Vein and
northwest-striking. It also includes several minor hanging wall veins (Figure 7).
There is limited drilling between the Keystone and Comet resource areas. Mineralised veins
are intersected in three holes indicating these veins likely extend southwards to within
approximately 150 m of the Comet lodes.

Lincoln Gold Project Permitting
The Lincoln Gold Project has been granted the necessary permits and approvals to operate
as a gold mine and process ore from the underground mine as well as undertake surface
and underground exploration activities.
The Lincoln Gold Project is subject to Federal, State and Local environmental regulations
and permitting. Authority for many Federal requirements are delegated to the State of
California. Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulations and rules is
administered primarily by state and local agencies.
The Lincoln Gold Project has been granted all three Major Permits and Approvals required
to operate and an underground mine, process ore and undertake exploration activities
underground and on the surface. These are:
1. Approval under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This is required
before a Conditional Use Permit (land use permit) is granted. This is a
Page 13 of 43

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Comprehensive approval covering virtually all aspects of project development,
operations, reclamation, and closure.
2. Conditional Use Permits (CUPs). Comprehensive permit, including conditions of
approval and mitigation measures required under CEQA, covering virtually all
aspects of project development, operations, reclamation, and closure.
3. Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs). The Project holds two WDR’s. one for
Interim land disposal of treated mine water. And the other Comprehensive water
quality permit for full scale operations including construction, operation, closure
and post-closure monitoring and maintenance of Waste Rock Pile, Surface Fill Unit,
and tailings disposal to the underground workings of Waste Piles and Expanded
Mining Operations.
Next Steps: Proposed Work Program
The most recent resource estimate was reported in 2015 under NI 43-101 when the gold
price was less that half of what it is today (Figure 8). The cutoff grade used in that estimate
was 4.1g/t, which is considered high in context of today’s gold price and work practices.
As part of due diligence approximately 250 samples (including standards and blanks) were
sent to an independent assay laboratory in Nevada. These results will be used to assess the
existing database and will lead to a re-evaluation of the resources at the Lincoln Gold
Project.
An assay results sensitivity analysis will be undertaken early in the restart of operations and
this will be used in the re-evaluation of the database.
1500-2500m of diamond drilling from underground will be completed at Lincoln-Comet to
collect material to assist in the estimation of a resource that can be reported under the JORC
Code.
The underground workings need to be prepared before drilling can commence. This work
includes scaling the decline, preparing drill sites, water monitoring and treatment, and
implementation of a Mines Rescue plan and training of a Mines Rescue Team.
The Company anticipates the drilling program will take about 6 weeks to complete after the
underground workings and drill sites are prepared.

operated vs. high US$3,036.74 oz on the 21st March 2025, when Haranga entered a trading
halt to acquire the project.
After the initial drilling program and subsequent mineral resource estimate are completed,
the Company will work to extend the resource with step-out drilling at Lincoln and Comet
as well identification and drilling of exploration targets at other locations within the package
of leases. The Company has already identified several high priority locations for drilling,
including, the South Spring Hill and Medean (Keystone) veins.
Additional Exploration Upside
Outside of the accessible workings, but still within the Lincoln Gold Project permits are
other opportunities. Payne5 (2008, pp28-34) identified in excess of 20 undrilled targets
(SSH Offset, Comet Offset, Stanford Offset, South Extension Lincoln Comet, Strain Shadows
(2 targets), North of Lincoln Comet (6 targets), Whisky Fault, Turner Vein System, Highway
Link Fault, West Wall Gold Fault, Niagara Fault, Talisman Boudinage Neck, South of Old
Lincoln (3 targets), Collins Fault, Joralemaon Offset and Railroad Vein) outside his resource.
Some of these would have been tested in the subsequent drilling programmes, but the
majority remain untested.
The obvious first target would be the South Spring Hill location, erroneously referred to as
the Keystone deposits in the historic reports, but sitting within the Medean and South Spring
Hill workings (Refer Figure 2). Payne5 (2008, pp61) included this mineralisation and other
sites known from historic underground sampling in his Non-Compliant superseded NI 43-
101 (Table 3 and Figure 9).
No mining has occurred in the Sutter Creek district since Payne’s report.
Outside of the project permits, remnant resources are known to exist along the Mother Lode
structure1,5 (Refer Figure 2). At the cessation of mining for the majority of the mines in the
Amador County/Sutter Creek region, historic unexploited resources are reported to exist.
Further opportunities exist in adjacent properties to the Lincoln Comet permits1, 2, 4, 5.

(iii) the announcement of a JORC compliant resource of at least 300,000oz Au at no
less than 5 grams per tonne (g/t), utilising a cutoff grade of 2 grams per tonne
(g/t) (40m Performance Rights); and
(iv) the announcement of a JORC compliant resource of at least 400,000oz Au at no
less than 5 grams per tonne (g/t), utilising a cutoff grade of 2 grams per tonne
(g/t) OR the announcement of a JORC exploration target of 200,000oz to
400,000oz Au at the Keystone prospect (40m Performance Rights).
In addition, as part of the transaction, Haranga shall issue to existing debt holders of Seduli
$965,000 in fully paid ordinary shares (at the same price as the associated capital raise-refer

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Separately, the holders of the Existing Debt Shares have agreed to a 6 month escrow period
from the date of issue and the holders of the Facilitation Shares have agreed to a 4 month

Other Deal Features:
The Lincoln-Comet mine has benefited from various financing arrangements, including an
Offtake and Prepayment arrangement with Geneva based Transamine SA, a deferred
production payment agreement with Rand Merchant Bank and a secured debt and royalty
funding arrangement.
Haranga has agreed, subject to completion of the Acquisition, to restructure certain of these
arrangements:
▪ Haranga has agreed with Transamine SA, that, subject to completion of the
Acquisition, the Transamine Offtake-debt of US$1.5m shall be converted to a
capped 0.5% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). Haranga will have the option to buy back
the NSR for US$1.75m within 24 months from completion. In addition, Transamine
will have the first right to future concentrate offtake only (not dorė), subject to terms
being agreed.
▪ Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), currently have an arrangement with Seduli whereby
RMB is to receive a dollar per ounce amount payable from production based on
various bands of production ounces up to a total of US$8.9m (RMB Deferred
Payment). Haranga is in discussions with RMB to restructure and simplify this
arrangement subject to completion of the Acquisition.
Finally, Seduli owes a 1.5% NSR and royalty debt to a consortium of investors including
royalty providers Deterra Royalties. On repayment of the royalty debt of US$1.453m, the
NSR will be reduced from 1.5% to a 0.75% NSR. It is Haranga’s intention to repay the debt
in due course, so that the NSR rate is reduced to 0.75%.
Board Changes
On completion of the Acquisition, the following changes will be effected:
• Dr Hendrik Schloemann shall resign from the Board;
• Mr Jeremy King shall join the Board as Non-Executive Director; and
• Seduli have proposed Mr Bruce McCracken to join the board as a nominee Non-
Executive Director on behalf of Seduli.
Mr Peter Batten will remain in his role as Managing Director and Mr Michael Davy will remain
in his role as Non-Executive Chairman.
Further details on incoming board members will be provided on appointment.

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
Schedule 1 – Lincoln Gold Project – Foreign Estimate Disclosures
The NI 43-101 Mineral Resources for the Lincoln Gold Project, as at 2 July 2015, are estimated at
958,910 tonnes at 9.3g/t Au for 286,000 ounces of gold.
The information in this announcement relating to the Lincoln Gold Project Mineral Resources is
reported in accordance with the requirements applying to foreign estimates in the ASX Listing Rules
and, as such, are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code.
A Competent Person has not yet completed sufficient work to classify the NI 43-101 Mineral
Resources as JORC Code Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC Code 2012.
It is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the NI 43-101 Mineral
Resources will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the
JORC Code.
The information in this announcement that relates to the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources and of the
Lincoln Gold Project has been extracted from the unpublished report entitled “Updated Technical
Report on the Lincoln Mine Project, Amador County, California, prepared for Sutter Gold Mining Inc”
dated 2 July 2015 (the “Report”), which sets out the Mineral Resources of the Lincoln Gold Project as
at 2 July 2015.
The Mineral Resource estimates for the Lincoln Gold Project have been prepared using the National
Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities
Administrators (the “Canadian NI 43-101 Standards”).
The Mineral Resources estimates for the Lincoln Gold Project are not, and do not purport to be,
compliant with the JORC Code and are therefore classified as “foreign estimates” under the ASX
Listing Rules.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12
5.12.1 The source and date of the historical estimates or foreign estimates
The Lincoln Gold Project Mineral Resource Estimates were prepared under the supervision of a
Qualified Persons (as defined in the Canadian NI 43101 Standards). The Qualified Persons were
employees of Mine Development Associates, an independent resources consulting firm from Reno,
Nevada, USA at the time. The Canadian NI 43101 Standards is a national instrument for the
Disclosure for Mineral Projects.
These foreign estimates are the latest estimates for the Lincoln Gold Project.
5.12.2 Mineral Resource Categories
Haranga believe that the mineral resource estimates completed under NI43101 at Lincoln Gold
Project conform with the categories specified in the JORC guidelines.
Haranga considers the foreign estimates to be NI43101 compliant at the time.
5.12.3 The relevance and materiality of the estimates to the entity
Haranga believes these historical and foreign resource estimates to be relevant and material to the
Company in that it justifies the transaction reported and focuses the Company exploration strategy
going forward.
Page 23 of 43

ASX RELEASE | 25 MARCH 2025
5.12.4 The reliability of the foreign estimates (reference to criteria in Table 1 of Appendix 5A
– JORC)
Haranga considers the foreign estimates to be reliable for the following reasons:
• Key criteria, as defined in Table 1 of the JORC Code 2012, has been addressed in the due
diligence completed by Haranga
• The foreign resource estimate was completed by Qualified Persons as defined in the
Canadian NI43101 Standard
Based on the information received and reviewed during site reviews as part of the due diligence
process Haranga believes the assumptions, parameters and methodologies are appropriate for the
Mineral Resource Estimate and consistent for this style of mineralisation.
5.12.5 A summary of work programs on which the estimates are based
The key information, assumptions and processes for mineral estimation are consistent with current
practices. Numerous programs have been completed and underground development allows
access to the orebody (no mining). A sum of US$64 M has been spent on the program since 1986.
5.12.6 More recent estimates available
The foreign resource estimates quoted in this release are the last estimate processed. Further work
has been completed but is related to the mill, underground infrastructure and bulk sampling
(failed). No significant depletion of the resources has occurred.
5.12.7 The work to be completed to verify the historical, foreign resource estimate under
JORC
A program of resampling of core and sample pulps has been undertaken and the samples sent to
an independent laboratory to help verify the existing data.
A program of sensitivity analysis is planned to be completed assessing the high grade nature of the
data and hoping to verify existing results in the database.
An underground drilling program of 1500m – 2500m will be undertaken immediately after
dewatering of the decline is complete and a Mines Rescue Team established. This will test existing
drilling and to close the drill spacing within the reported resource.
5.12.8 Timing of any evaluation or exploration planned
The planned drilling will take place as soon as dewatering is complete approximately six weeks
from now. The pulps and sample are on the way to the laboratory. Sensitivity analysis as soon as the
deal is complete.
5.12.9 A cautionary statement
See beginning of release.
5.12.10 A statement by a named Competent Person

techniques |  |  | • Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut
channels, random chips, or specific
specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld
XRF instruments, etc). These examples
should not be taken as limiting the
broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to
ensure sample representivity and the
appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of
mineralisation that are Material to the
Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work
has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1 m samples from
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a
30 g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases, more explanation may be
required, such as where there is coarse
gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of
detailed information. |  |  | • Drilling Results used as the basis for the Foreign Resource Estimation (NI43-101) are summarised in the report
entitled “Updated Technical Report on the Lincoln Mine Project, Amador Co., CA, Sutter Gold Mining Inc.” created
on 2nd July 2015 and available to view on https://haranga.com/investors/asx-announcements/.
Historical Sampling
• Drilling commenced in 1983-84, with an initial 5 Reverse Circulation (RC) drillholes at Medean/Spring Hill South,
with an additional 2 RC holes (unmineralized) completed at Lincoln Comet. RC drilling was excluded from the
most recent resource estimations.
• The balance of total meterage completed at Lincoln-Comet is Diamond Drilling from both surface and
underground (99% of meterage in database), and surface drilling only at Medean/Spring Hill South (80% of
meterage in database) through to 2012.
• An additional 55 underground jackleg holes for 403m advance were completed at Lincoln-Comet as part of pre-
production in 2013, and are excluded from the resource estimation.
• A component of channel sampling (753 underground channel samples, typically taken from the face of
development, but also wall channel samples) is present in the database from development at Lincoln-Comet,
accounting for approximately 10% of the gold assays within the resource database. The higher mean and median
values for the underground samples, as compared to the drill-hole data, are considered to reflect the
concentrated location of underground sampling along the major veins within the high-grade centre of the deposit.
• Although there are some concerns over sample reliability, the underground sample data were considered to
provide significant spatial and grade control within the deposit and were deemed appropriate for use in estimation
in the most recent NI 43-101 foreign estimate.
• As the bulk of sampling is from relatively recent diamond core, industry standard practices can be confidently
anticipated.
- A coarse gold component is to be expected in high grade gold mines of the Californian Mother Lode, which
have produced at over 10 g/t Au historically, and is confirmed within the Project. Various efforts at duplicate
sampling of core are recorded in later drill programmes to address QA/QC relating to coarse gold.
- All sample analysis is by Fire assay, with various programmes using (metallic) screen fire assay (SMF) to
assist in the accurate sampling of gold in core. Significant gold was confirmed present in the coarse fraction
of screening. |  |

contain any downhole surveys (or 18% of diamond drill holes). The majority of these holes are short length
holes with only 6 holes over 50m in length that are missing surveys. Mining Plus considers the lack of
downhole surveys available for checks to be low risk to the integrity of the drillhole database particularly in
areas proximal to existing underground development. While the quality of surveys in some of the deeper
holes may not accurately define the exact location of mineralised lodes, this would have a limited impact on
the thickness of the mineralisation and overall volume.

• In 1989-1990, Meridian developed the Stringbean Alley decline to facilitate exploration of the
newly discovered Comet deposit (Tietz et al., 2015). The decline was 880 m long, 3.7 m high,
4.6 m wide and declined at a rate of 12%. 731 m of crosscuts were also developed. The initial
goal was for the decline to continue through to the Lincoln orebody, but it was terminated
before reaching the Lincoln zone. From within the underground development, Meridian
conducted chip sampling and diamond drilling, resulting in additional resources being
defined within the Comet zone. Four development raises and 274 m of sublevel drifts were
constructed, and a 7,366-tonne bulk sample was collected and milled at the nearby Royal
Mountain King mill.

17.9.
• At Lincoln-Comet, MDA classified most of the resource as Inferred with only a small
proportion in the Indicated category. This was due to the nugget character of the deposit
resulting in uncertainty in grade estimation. Twenty-six additional holes were drilled at
Lincoln-Comet after the 2011 MDA resource was estimated (p133 ) section 14.2:
• - “… MDA reviewed all 26 of the surface holes completed in 2012, along with the majority
of underground drilling and sampling, and concludes that this drilling substantially supports
the 2011 estimate. Though the drilling and underground development did locally extend and
expand the high-grade gold zones, this work did not change the resource in a material way. For
this reason, the Lincoln-Comet resource estimate described in this section is still current…”
• This estimation does use underground channel sampling (approximately 10% of assays)
in grade estimation.
• For Keystone Foreign Resource Estimate source data, also refer the Updated Technical
Report, p154, summarised in Table 14.12.
• At Keystone, MDA classified the resource as Inferred due to the wide drill spacing and
lack of underground sampling. MDA noted that there is a possibility that portions of the
resource have been mined out historically.
