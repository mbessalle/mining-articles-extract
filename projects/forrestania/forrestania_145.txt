ASX Announcement
EXTENSION OF SETTLEMENT DATE FOR
FORRESTANIA TENEMENTS.
PERTH, AUSTRALIA – 18 September 2024 - Classic Minerals Ltd (ASX: CLZ) (“Classic”, or the
“Company” refers to its purchase of the Forrestania tenements from Reed Exploration Pty Ltd (a
wholly owned subsidiary of Redivium Limited (ASX:RIL) (Redivium)) as detailed in the
announcement of 03 October 2023 and extension announcements of 05 February 2024, 16 May 2024
and 05 June 2024.
The Company and Redivium have agreed to extend the completion date to 01 November 2024 (or
such other date as agreed), to provide additional time for Classic to settle payment and completion
of closure formalities.
As part of the extension:
• Classic will settle the balance of payments due at completion of approximately $350,000
plus interest charged at 12%, on or before 01 November 2024; and
• Classic will pay Redivium an additional penalty fee, in consideration for continual delays
to completion of the transaction, of an amount equal to 15% multiplied by the total
outstanding amounts (including interest) owed by Classic at the completion date.
Both parties remain fully committed to completion of the transaction.
This announcement has been approved by the Board.

ABOUT THE FORRESTANIA GOLD PROJECT
The FGP Tenements (excluding Kat Gap) are registered in the name of Reed Exploration Pty Ltd, a wholly
owned subsidiary of ASX listed Redivium Ltd (ASX: RIL), previously Hannans Ltd. Classic held 80% of the gold
rights on the FGP Tenements via a third party, whilst Redivium maintained its 20% interest in the gold rights.
Classic is in the process of purchasing the final 20% from Redivium pending terms of the binding sale
agreement (CLZ HNR ASX release 03 Oct 2023 and RIL CLZ ASX release 5 June 2024). For the avoidance of
doubt Classic Ltd owns a 100% interest in the gold rights on the Kat Gap Tenements and also non-gold rights
including but not limited to nickel and lithium.
Classic has inferred and indicated mineral resources of 8.09Mt at 1.45 g/t for 377,946 ounces of gold,
classified and reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012), with Scoping Study (see ASX Announcement
released 2nd May 2017) suggesting both the technical and financial viability of the project. The current post-
mining Mineral Resource for Lady Ada, Lady Magdalene and Kat Gap is tabulated below. Additional technical
detail on the Mineral Resource estimation is provided, further in the text below and in the JORC Table 1 as
attached to ASX announcements dated 21 June 2023.
