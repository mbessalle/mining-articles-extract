**About Surge Battery Metals Inc.**

**About the Nevada North Lithium Project**

The Company's **Nevada North Lithium Project,** located in the Granite Range southeast of Jackpot, Nevada 73 km north-northeast of Wells, Elko County, Nevada. The first two rounds of drilling, completed in 2022 and 2023, identified a strongly mineralized zone of lithium bearing clays occupying a strike length of more than 3,000 meters and a known width of up to 950 meters. Highly anomalous soil values and geophysical surveys suggest there is potential for the clay horizons to be much greater in extent. The Nevada North Lithium Project has a pit-constrained Inferred Resource containing an estimated 4.67Mt of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) grading 2,839 ppm Li at a 1,250 ppm cutoff. The 2024 drilling program is complete and continued to intersect high-grade lithium mineralization and has extended drill-indicated mineralization 1,300 meters to the south from 2022 and 2023 holes. The 2024 drilling results will be incorporated into an updated and expanded resource estimate, which will be released mid to late September.
