Following completion by Rapid Lithium of its initial drilling activities and receipt of relevant assay reports, the Company will (at its sole option) determine whether or not to proceed with the transactions contemplated under the Contract for Deed. If Rapid Lithium elects to proceed with the Contract for Deed, the Company must continue to make payments in accordance with the Contract for Deed. If the Company determines to no longer proceed with the Contract for Deed, the Company must provide written notice to the Vendor accordingly. Upon provision of such notice the Contract for Deed will be terminated, possession of the property will transfer to the Vendors and each party released from any further obligations or liabilities under the Contract for Deed.
