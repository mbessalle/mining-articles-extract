The parties agree that following the payment of the amount referred to in (i) above, the

with the transactions contemplated under the Contract for Deed.
If Rapid Lithium elects to proceed with the Contract for Deed, the Company must continue
to make payments in accordance with the Contract for Deed.
If the Company determines to no longer proceed with the Contract for Deed, the Company
must provide written notice to the Vendor accordingly. Upon provision of such notice the
Contract for Deed will be terminated, possession of the property will transfer to the
Vendors and each party released from any further obligations or liabilities under the

Mateen early next week
Patriot Lithium Term Sheet:
The Company also advises that it has resolved not to proceed with the acquisition of New
Energy (US) Inc as disclosed on 7 November 2024 from Patriot Lithium Limited (ASX: PAT)

strategic acquisition of the highly prospective Prophet River Gallium-Germanium Project
(refer ASX announcement of 20 December 2024).
Commenting on the Company’s strategic update, Rapid Lithium’s Managing Director,

“This strategy, centred on our portfolio, positions the Company ideally to prioritize lithium
exploration on its fully permitted private land in South Dakota. It also allows us to advance
and initiate exploration at the Gallium-Germanium project in British Columbia.”
