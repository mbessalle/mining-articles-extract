Highlights 
• Thunderbird enters into binding agreement to acquire a 100% interest in a highly prospective 
488km2 exploration portfolio surrounding the Hillgrove Gold-Antimony project, a Top-10 global 
antimony deposit.  
• The package, comprising EL9053 and EL9147, including sampling grades of up to 18.2%3 
antimony and 76g/t gold4, sits in the heart of the New England Orogen of NSW, which is 
currently undergoing a major exploration renaissance.  
• EL9053, known as the Rockvale Project, covers potential strike extensions of the gold-antimony 
mineralisation at Hillgrove and encompasses multiple known gold and antimony occurrences, 
including numerous high-grade historical workings. 
• EL9053 adjoins Larvotto Resources’ (ASX: LRV) Hillgrove Gold & Antimony Project, the largest 
antimony deposit in Australia, with a Mineral Resource of 7.3Mt @ 4.4g/t Au and 1.3% Sb for 
1.04Moz of contained gold and 93kt of contained antimony1,2. 
• EL9147, known as the Kookabookra Gold Project, covers multiple gold reefs in the historical 
high-grade Kookabookra gold field. 
• Both Projects are considered highly prospective for the discovery of high-grade orogenic gold 
+/- antimony mineralisation and intrusion-related gold mineralisation. 
• The proposed acquisition provides a low-cost opportunity to explore high-quality assets that 
offer exposure to very favourable commodities, with the ability to explore and generate 
newsflow during the northern hemisphere winter when Thunderbird’s Canadian assets are less 
accessible. 
• Antimony is a critical metal used for producing high-tech and defence products, including flame 
retardant materials, semiconductors and superhard materials. Antimony prices have been rising 
strongly since China, which dominates global supply, imposed export restrictions earlier this year. 
 
Thunderbird Resources Limited (Thunderbird or the Company) (ASX: THB) is pleased to advise that it 
has entered into an agreement to acquire a highly prospective antimony and gold exploration land 
package in the New England Orogen of New South Wales. The high-potential exploration portfolio is 
located immediately adjacent to Australia’s largest antimony deposit, the Hillgrove Gold & Antimony 
Project owned by Larvotto Resources (ASX: LRV) (LRV) (Figures 1 and 2).  
Thunderbird has entered into a binding share purchase agreement with the shareholders of Kooky 
Resources Pty Ltd (Kooky Resources) to acquire all the issued share capital of Kooky Resources 
(Proposed Acquisition).  
Kooky Resources holds a 100% interest in exploration licences EL9053 and EL9147, which offer strong 
prospectivity for high-grade antimony and gold mineralisation.

EL9053 lies directly adjacent to the Hillgrove Gold & Antimony Project held by LRV, which represents 
the largest antimony deposit in Australia with a Mineral Resource of 7.3Mt @ 4.4g/t Au and 1.3% Sb 
for 1.04Moz of contained gold and 93kt of contained antimony1,2.   
The Hillgrove Gold & Antimony Project is currently being redeveloped by LRV and already has most of 
the surface infrastructure in place, including the process plant, power, roads, decline and substantial 
underground development. Leveraging this existing infrastructure, LRV recently announced a positive 
pre-feasibility study, targeting first ore production by early 20261. 
EL9053 covers potential strike extensions of the geology and structures that host the antimony-gold 
mineralisation at Hillgrove.  
Numerous historical prospects and occurrences are reported within EL9053 with sampling grades of 
up to 18.2%3 antimony and 76g/t4 gold reported. Despite the number of historical gold and antimony 
occurrences the area has had minimal modern exploration or drilling since the 1980s. 
EL9047 covers the historical Kookabookra gold field, which has seen virtually no modern exploration, 
with multiple gold occurrences and potential for both orogenic gold +/-antimony mineralisation and 
intrusion related gold mineralisation.  
Management Comment 
Thunderbird Executive Chairman George Bauk said:  
“This Proposed Acquisition provides an enormously exciting, low-cost opportunity for Thunderbird to acquire 
highly prospective exploration tenements in the heart of Australia’s emerging antimony district. The projects 
surround Larvotto Resources’ Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Project, a top ten antimony resource globally and 
scheduled to commence production in early 2026.  
Notably, the geological structures that host Hillgrove’s deposits potentially extend north-west into 
Thunderbird’s newly acquired tenements, which also host numerous historical prospects and targets with 
significant antimony results, including 18.2%3 Sb.  
“Antimony is classified as a critical metal and has recently experienced surging prices thanks to its role in 
energy transition technologies, the high-tech sector and defence. Antimony spot prices currently sit at record 
highs of around US$25,000 per tonne, more than double what they were 12 months ago.  
The tenements have seen very little or no modern exploration and also offer outstanding high-grade gold 
potential, with results including 76g/t4 Au, and exceptionally high grades from historical workings.   
“Our initial exploration programs at these assets will focus on these historical workings and prospects but we 
will also consider unexplored areas using modern airborne geophysicsto develop new targets. 
“Importantly, these new tenements also provide an opportunity for Thunderbird to undertake exploration 
throughout the year, providing news flow and share price catalysts for the Company during the northern 
hemisphere winter when our Canadian exploration assets are less accessible.”

EL9053 – Rockvale Project Overview 
EL9053, known as the Rockvale Project covers an area of 358km2 in the New England Orogen of NSW. 
The Rockvale Project comprises an established antimony and gold district that is located near Larvotto 
Resources’ (ASX: LRV) Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project (adjacent to the south-east and south-west), 
Trigg Minerals' (ASX:TMG) Spartan West Antimony Project Lode Resources’ (ASX: LDR) New England 
Antimony Project (adjacent to the north and north-east), Critical Resources’ (ASX: CRR) Hillgrove South 
Antimony-Gold Project (adjacent to the south and south-east), and Koonenberry Gold’s (ASX: KNB) 
recently acquired Enmore Gold Project (15km to the south) (Figure 1). 
The Rockvale Project comprises a series of disconnected areas that includes the potential north-west 
strike extensions of the geology and structures that host LRV’s Hillgrove Au-Sb Mine. The Rockvale 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Project area is predominantly underlain by the Rockvale and Hillgrove Monzogranites which have 
intruded the Coffs Harbour Association siltstones, the latter two rock units being the main hosts of 
mineralisation at the Hillgrove Project. 
Historical exploration records (sourced from the Geological Survey of New South Wales DIGS website) 
indicate numerous antimony and gold prospects and occurrences within EL9053 (see Figure 2), with 
some very high-grade gold and antimony reported. The most significant antimony prospects identified 
from the initial review of historical data are as follows: 
Girrakool Prospect Area (Sb): 
Semi-massive stibnite mineralisation within a quartz vein have been reported with assays up to 
18.2% Sb3. Assays up to 590g/t Ag3 are also reported from the prospect with historical workings 
and shafts up to 90m deep reported from the prospect location. The mineralised quartz veins 
occur along a north-south trending shear zone, and there has been no modern exploration or 
reports of drilling in the area.  
Achill Prospect (Sb): 
The prospect is located around 12.5km northeast of the Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project and lies 
between two north-east trending regional-scale faults, the Chandler Fault and the Hillgrove Fault, 
which are interpreted to be important controls on the mineralisation at the Hillgrove Project. 
Historical underground workings are reported to be up to 15m deep. A quartz breccia with stibnite 
mineralisation has been sampled with assays reported up to 4.65% Sb3 and 265g/t Ag3. There has 
been no modern exploration or reports of drilling in this area. 
Thorpleigh Prospect (Sb+Au): 
This prospect is proximal to the Hillgrove Fault with historical workings up to 18m deep and 
striking approximately north-south. Sampling of a quartz-stibnite vein within a fault or shear zone 
has reported assays up to 1.25% Sb3 and 1.57g/t Au3. Again, there has been no modern 
exploration in the area and no reports of any drilling.  
 
EL9053 also demonstrates outstanding prospectivity for high-grade gold mineralisation, with numerous 
historical exploration prospects and occurrences reported including: 
 
Taits Gully Prospect (Au+Sb) 
Several historical workings and shafts occur within this area with reports of shafts (Mary-Ann and 
Endeavour shafts) to a depth of up to 75m. Gold mineralisation is associated with an east-west 
trending shear zone which reportedly strikes over 800m with a width of 1.5m or greater. Samples 
of vein quartz from the area reported assays up to 15g/t Au3, whilst samples of dump material by 
Freeport Australia returned assays up to 76g/t Au and 318g/t Ag from a calc-silicate rock4. In 
1983 and 1984 Freeport drilled four diamond drill-holes (total of 391m and a maximum depth of 
134m – see Appendix 1 Table 1 below or details) and three percussion drill holes (for 264m) at the 
workings. Although no significant intercepts were reported, Freeport recommended further work 
including drilling. No further drilling is reported from the prospect since this time. 
In addition to the gold mineralisation, antimony mineralisation within a quartz-stibnite vein 
associated with shafts up to 150m deep is reported, with assays up to 1.39% Sb and 3.1g/t Au3.  
Union Jack (Au) 
The Union Jack prospect area has underground workings and shallow pits to a depth of 17m and 
over 50m strike length, with grab sample assays up to 3.7g/t Au, 0.23% Sb and 1640 g/t Ag3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
reported. Mineralisation is associated with quartz veins in an altered granite and a small 
fault/shear zone striking south-west, which can be traced for over 400m. 
 
Little Nell Mine/Great Britain Mine area (Au) 
At the Great Britain prospect old workings and shafts to a depth of 122m are reported with grab 
samples assaying up to 33.5g/t Au3. Mineralisation is associated with an east-west trending quartz 
vein. 
 
EL9147 – Kookabookra Gold Project Overview 
EL9147, known as the Kookabookra Gold Project, covers 130km2 in the New England Orogen of NSW 
and lies 50km north of LRV’s Hillgrove Au-Sb Project (see Figure 3). The area is considered prospective 
for intrusion-related gold mineralisation, a local example of which is the Timbarra Au deposit (Total 
mineral resource of 16.8Mt @ 0.73g/t Au for 396,800 oz Au5) which is approximately 100km north of 
the Kookabookra Project. The historical gold mineralisation reported from the Kookabookra gold field 
occurs in multiple quartz veins/reefs hosted by sheared/mylonitised granite adjacent to the 
Wongwibinda Fault3. The numerous quartz reefs within the Kookabookra Monzogranite were 
historically mined for high-grade Au (around 1870s-1890s), the most notable being: 
• 
Welcome Stranger/Pilgrims Progress Reef – quartz vein with localised breccia and pyrite in an 
altered granite. Rock chips of vein quartz reported assays up to 42.6g/t Au3 
• 
Kookabookra Reef – rock chips of vein quartz reported assays up to 18.5g/t Au and 0.33% Sb3 
• 
British Lion Reef – Sheared altered granite with laminated quartz vein and anomalous 
antimony. 
• 
Dittons Mine – vein quartz in altered granite with anomalous antimony3. 
Further to the east in the Bear Hill area, gold mineralisation occurs within quartz veins hosted by the 
Kookabookra Monzogranite and within the Dyamberin Beds (siltstones, mudstones) proximal to the 
contact with the monzogranite. Examples of these occurrences include: 
• 
Bear Hill Mine – at the contact between the Kookabookra monzogranite and Dyamberin Beds. 
Vein quartz and quartz-ankerite-pyrite breccia in an extensively altered host rock. Average 
grade of production was reportedly about 24g/t Au3. 
• 
Butchers Reef – an east-west trending quartz vein and breccia in granite and sediments 
(Dyamberin Beds). A reported average production grade of 32.5g/t Au3. 
There are no records of drilling undertaken to evaluate any of the high-grade reefs in the 
Kookabookra/Bear Hill areas, many of which can be traced up to 150 metres. The gold mineralised 
veins in this area are reported to also have anomalous levels of antimony, suggesting the mineral 
system could potentially be analogous to the Hillgrove Au-Sb mineralisation. 
The most recent exploration with the project area is in the northwest corner of the tenement, where 
shallow, potentially intrusive-related, low-grade gold mineralisation was intersected in limited drilling at 
the Mannix and Mt Secret Prospects.

Mt Secret Prospect 
Two small RC drilling programs were completed in the period 2012 to 2015 with 7 RC drill holes 
completed for a total 323m, with the deepest hole to 79m. The drilling targeted historical gold 
workings over a strike length of 60m and a shaft to a depth of 20m. Drilling indicated a possible quartz 
veined, brecciated intrusive body with low-grade Au mineralisation. The most significant results from 
the program were as follows (all downhole lengths): 
o 
17m @ 0.43 g/t Au from 10m (MSDH2)6 
o 
2m @ 0.81 g/t Au from 40m (MSDH2) 6 
o 
4m @ 0.38 g/t Au from 22m (MSDH3)6 
o 
1m @ 2.5 g/t Au from 32m (MSDH3)6 
o 
6m @ 0.67 g/t Au from 69m (MSDH7) 7 
In 2019 a further eight RC drill holes were drilled south of Mt. Secret to test a magnetic anomaly with 
no significant results reported. 
Mannix Prospect 
RC Drilling was completed at the Mannix prospect between 2015 and 2017, with 12 holes for 417m 
completed across two separate programs. The drilling targeted a gold in soil anomaly (800m x 400m in 
extent). Every drill hole in the program intersected low-grade Au mineralisation (>0.1g/t Au) with the 
most significant results being as follows (all downhole lengths): 
o 
12m @ 0.53 g/t Au from 10m (ending in mineralisation consisting of 1m @ 1.62 g/t Au; 
MD7)8 
o 
13m @ 0.41 g/t Au from 31m (MD3) 8 
o 
15m @ 0.37 g/t Au from 7m (ending in mineralisation consisting of 1m @ 3.42 g/t Au; 
MD4) 8 
o 
6m @ 0.63 g/t Au from 10m (MD2) 8 
o 
6m @ 0.47 g/t Au from 4m (MD3) 8 
o 
17m @ 0.26 g/t Au from 44m (MD10) 9 
o 
21m @ 0.21 g/t Au from 1m (ending in mineralisation; MD1) 8 
Gold mineralisation occurs within a fractured and altered quartz veined granite with the mineralisation 
described as Intrusive Related. A single diamond drill hole (MD13) was completed in 2017 to a depth of 
170m with disappointing results but did intersect 3.5m @ 0.34g/t Au from 41.1m and 0.5m @ 4.41g/t 
Au from 109.8m9

Planned Work Programs 
Initial work on the Rockvale Antimony-Gold and Kookabookra Gold Project will be focused on a 
detailed compilation of all historical exploration and publicly available geological data. Following this 
compilation a review of the data will be undertaken to identify the high-priority target areas for initial 
on-ground work. Initial on-ground work is likely to comprise geological mapping, rock chip and soil 
sampling and detailed aeromagnetics.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling. 
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and 
the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
 
• 
All the data reported above is taken from historical exploration reports from 
the NSW Geological Survey DIGS database. Most of the sampling (grab) 
reported were taken from Geological Survey of New South Wales 
Department of Mineral Resources Report: Gilligan, L.B., Brownlow J.W., 
Cameron, R.G., Henley, H.F.,1992. Dorrigo-Coffs Harbour 1:250,000

Deposit Data Sheets, 509pp. New South Wales Geological Survey, Sydney 
• 
The  representivity of historical sampling data taken from the Gilligan et al, 
1992 report - or any others referenced in this report - cannot be verified or 
validated at this time. 
• 
As stated above in the body of the report under Cautionary Statement, the 
sampling, assaying and location methods used for the samples reported above 
are currently unknown. To what extent the samples are representative of the 
prospects/occurrences is also not known. None of the prospects or 
occurrences reported have yet been ground-truthed or verified by the 
Company. These results are reported only as an indicator of the likely 
presence of antimony or gold mineralisation. Average historical production 
grades quoted above have also been sourced from the same report and 
cannot be verified by the Company. Furthermore and as stated in the 
“Planned Work Programs” section if this press release, a full public data 
compilation will be completed in the coming weeks. This work, along with 
initial geological reconnaissance work programs, will aim to provide further 
information – where available – on historic sampling methodologies and 
representivity. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type and details 
• 
Taits Gully prospect – reported as Diamond drilling and open hole percussion 
(see Appendix 1 above). No further details available currently. 
• 
Mt. Secret and Mannix prospects – Reverse Circulation drilling and one 
diamond drill hole reported. 
Drill sample

nature of the samples. 
representative samples were. RC drilling at Mt. Secret and Mannix reported as 
3kg split of drill cuttings sent for assay. No information recorded on the 
method used to obtain the split sample. 
Logging 
• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically 
logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation studies. 
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature.  
• Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. 
• 
Chip and core samples have been geologically logged in the context of early-
stage exploration drilling, and not intended for use in a Mineral Estimate. 
However, the level of detail could support studies of that nature if required. 
• 
Drill hole logging, where available in historical reports, is qualitative in nature. 
• 
No core photography available in historical exploration reports. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and sample 
preparation 
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether all core taken. 
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether 
sampled wet or dry. 
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample 
preparation technique. 
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to 
maximise representivity of samples. 
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ 
material collected, including field duplicate results. 
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material 
being sampled. 
• 
Core drilling – sampling methodology not reported in historical exploration 
reports. 
• 
RC drilling at Mt. Secret and Mannix reported as 3kg split of drill cuttings sent 
for assay. Not recorded whether samples were wet or dry or how split sample 
was taken. 
• 
No information is available on how samples were collected by NSW 
Geological survey study, nor how the samples were assayed. These samples 
were intended to understand and characterize the mineralization at 
occurrences/prospect. 
• 
It is unknown how representative the samples collected by the NSW 
Geological survey are of each mineral occurrence or prospect. 
The samples collected from the RC drilling completed at the Mt. Secret and 
Mannix prospects were sent to SGS Laboratories, West Wyalong and used 
Sample preparation code PRP86 which includes pulverizing samples to 75 
microns.  
• 
Sample sizes are unknown except the samples from the RC drilling completed 
at the Mt. Secret and Mannix prospects, which were a 3kg split, which is 
considered appropriate. 
• 
Composite sampling has been used for some drillholes reported in the body of 
the report above and Appendix 1. Where single-metre and composite assay 
results exist for an interval, single-metre assay results have been reported. 
• 
 
Quality of 
assay data 
and laboratory 
tests 
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory 
procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. 
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the 
parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make 
and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation,

Information on assaying methods used by NSW Geological Survey is not 
available in the source document. Samples from Drilling at Mt. Secret and 
Mannix prospects were sent to SGS Laboratories, West Wyalong with the 
gold assay determined using method FAA505 – a fire assay technique. Other 
elements were measured using a handheld XRF but these results are not

reported here. 
 
 
• 
Information on quality control procedures used by NSW Geological Survey is 
not available in the source document. There were no field duplicates, blanks 
or standards reported in the RC drilling at Mannix and Mt.Secret. It is 
reasonable to assume that the laboratory used, SGS in West Wyalong, would 
have used internal quality control procedures including standards, blanks and 
duplicates, although this information is not available. 
• 
Rock chip sampling by Freeport of Australia Inc. was subject to lab duplicates 
as well as umpire lab testing, all of which are reported in Appendix 1 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
• The verification of significant intersections by either independent or 
alternative company personnel. 
• The use of twinned holes. 
• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, 
data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. 
 
 
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data. 
• 
Significant intersections and assay results reported above, taken from 
historical exploration reports, have been checked by more than one Company 
geologist. Rock sample and assay data report from Geological Survey of NSW 
was by qualified geologists. 
• 
No twinned holes reported. 
• 
Historical data collected and collated by the NSW Geological Survey (available 
on DIG Records, Geological Survey of New South Wales Department of 
Mineral Resources website. 
• 
No adjustments applied to assay data. 
Location of 
data points 
• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-
hole surveys), and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
• Specification of the grid system used. 
 
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
• 
No information available on how the NSW Geological Survey samples were 
located. 
Drill hole collar locations (Mt. Secret and Mannix were determined by hand-
held GPS (+/-5m)  
 
• 
All data reported is in the MGA94 grid system, Zone 56. 
 
• 
Topographic control adequate and appropriate for the intentions of this report 
Data spacing 
and 
distribution 
• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
 
 
• Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the 
degree of geological and grade continuity  
 
• 
Sampling by NSW Geological survey geologist was of mineral occurrences and 
prospects wherever they were located. 
 
• 
The data spacing and distribution was not intended and is not sufficient to 
establish geological and grade continuity for a Mineral Resource or Ore 
Reserve estimate.

Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
• Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
 
• 
Sample compositing was not applied. 
Orientation of 
data in 
relation to 
geological 
structure 
• Whether the orientation of the sampling achieves unbiased sampling of 
possible structures. 
• 
All drilling reported was at high angles to the interpreted orientation of 
mineralized structures and should therefore have been unbiased in terms of 
sampling. 
Sampling by NSW Geological survey is unknown in terms of orientation. 
In some cases, width information is given for the surface rock chip samples 
recorded by the NSW Geological Survey. It is unknown whether this is 
representative of the sample width or a measurement of the total width of the 
structure. 
Sample 
security 
• The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
• Unknown – not recorded in historical reports. 
Audits or 
reviews 
• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
• 
Unknown – not recorded in historical reports.

Commentary 
Mineral tenement 
and land tenure 
status 
• Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including 
agreements or material issues with third parties. 
• The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any 
known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. 
• 
The Rockvale Project comprises one exploration licence, EL9053, covering 
358km2. Ownership is 100% by Kooky Resources Pty Ltd. 
The Kookabookra Project comprises one exploration licence, EL9147, covering 
130km2.  Ownership is 100% by Kooky Resources Pty Ltd. 
• 
Both exploration licences are granted and current. The Avondale State 
Conservation Area, which covers around 316 hectares, lies within the northern 
part of EL9053. Under the NSW NPW Act mining activities are permissible in a 
State Conservation Area (SCA). Approval from the Minister administering the 
NPW Act is required prior to exploration in a SCA. 
The Guy Fawkes National Park lies along part of the northern and southeastern 
margins of EL9147. 
There are no other known impediments to operate. 
Exploration done 
by other parties 
• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. 
• 
Historical prospecting and mining on the Rockvale and Kookabookra Projects 
dates back to the 1850s. Gold was discovered at the Hillgrove mine in 1883. 
More modern exploration has taken place intermittently from the 1970s to the 
present day. Notable exploration on the project areas was conducted by 
Freeport Australia (included drilling at the Taits Gully prospect), Aberfoyle 
Exploration, New England Antimony Mines, Peel Mining, Sovereign Gold.  
At the Kookabookra Project the most notable exploration conducted was by 
P.W.English and Associates between 2012 and 2020 at the Mannix and Mt. 
Secret prospects. 
The key historical exploration work completed, in the context of this report, was 
that by the Geological Survey of NSW, and reported in Gilligan et al, 1992. 
 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. 
• 
The Rockvale and Kookabookra Projects are geologically located within the 
Nambucca Block of the New England Orogen. The areas are predominantly 
underlain by late Palaeozoic metasediments and Permo-Carboniferous 
Granitoids.  Both projects have potential for Hillgrove-style orogenic antimony-
gold mineralisation. Mineralised vein and breccia systems at Hillgrove are 
hosted in sedimentary rocks of the late Palaeozoic (Girrakool Beds), biotite 
monzogranite (S-type) of the ~300 Ma Hillgrove Adamellite and granodioritic-
dioritic rocks of the early Permian Bakers Creek Diorite Complex. The structures

and mineralisation post-date and are unrelated to any of the host rocks. 
• 
The Kookabookra Project also has potential for intrusion-related gold with some 
geological similarities to the Timbarra gold deposit located 100km north. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all material information including a tabulation of the 
following information for all Material drill holes: 
o Easting, northing and elevation of the drill hole collar 
o Dip, azimuth and depth of the hole 
o down hole length and interception depth 
• 
Relevant drill hole information provided in Appendix 1 and body of report 
above.  
Data aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) 
and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should 
be clearly stated. 
• 
Assay results reported above for drilling at Mt. Secret and Mannix prospects 
(Kookabookra Project) as weighted averages, with no maximum grade cut-off 
applied, a lower cut-off of 0.1ppm Au and a maximum internal waste (<0.1ppm 
Au) of 2m. Assay results for those drill holes with no assay results reported 
above are not considered to be of economic significance and immaterial. 
 
 
• 
Not applicable - no metal equivalents reported. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is 
known, its nature should be reported. 
• If the True width is not known there should be a clear statement to this 
effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
Taits Gully prospect – Drilling completed by Freeport was orthogonal to the 
interpreted east-west trending mineralised structure. No significant intercepts 
were reported by Freeport. 
• 
Mt. Secret and Mannix prospects – RC drilling completed at high-angle to the 
interpreted approximately north-south trending mineralised structure(s). It is 
unclear whether the intercepts reported are true width or not and are reported 
above as downhole lengths only. 
 
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant discovery being reported These 
should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Refer to Figures in the body of the report above. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not 
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or 
widths should be practiced. 
• All relevant results reported in the body of report above. The Company has no 
knowledge of how representative the samples taken by the Geological Survey of 
NSW are of the historical occurrences and prospects. This information is not 
available. 
• Not all sample assay data has been included in this report as it is not 
considered material beyond the representatively reported high- and low-

grade results presented in the main body of this ASX Release. 
• Drill results are reported as grade/widths with a grade cut-off of 0.2 g/t Au 
and a maximum internal waste of 2m.  
• Assay results for other metal concentrations in the historical drilling results 
reported in the body of the report above have not been included as they are 
inconsistently reported in the original reports and are not considered 
material to this announcement. 
• Results from work completed by Freeport of Australia at the Taits Gully 
prospect (EL 9053) aren’t included as no significant intercepts (>0.2 g/t Au) 
were reported and therefore are not considered material to this report. 
• Surface sample results taken from the public reports referenced in this 
announcement are reported as grades that are >1000 ppm Sb and 1 g/t Au. 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported 
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey 
results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of 
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• No other relevant exploration data to report currently. Historical data will be 
verified on the ground once land access is obtained to the relevant target areas. 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral 
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including 
the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas. 
• 
Further work on the project likely to include the following: 
o 
Detailed historical data compilation and review 
o 
Identify initial high-priority target areas 
o 
Negotiation of land access agreements in areas of targets 
o 
Commence on-ground exploration on target areas.
