● Considerable potential for resource expansion remains with multiple
additional roll fronts mapped within the Carter Project
● Experienced uranium geologist, Ben Vallerine appointed as Non-Executive
Director, Ben brings significant US experience to the Board.
● Recharge to raise $2.5 million to fund exploration over the next 12 months
**Cautionary Statement: Historical Resource Estimate: Readers are cautioned that the
historical resource estimates for the Acadia and Mindy Deposits, referred to in this
Announcement are not reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. A Competent
Person has not undertaken sufficient work to classify the historical resource estimates as
mineral resources in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. Nothing has come to the
attention of Recharge that causes it to question the accuracy or the reliability of the
former owner’s estimates. However, Recharge has not independently validated the
former owner’s estimates and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or
endorsing those estimates. Following evaluation and further exploration work, it is
uncertain whether it will be possible to report this historical resource estimate as a
mineral resource in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The historical resource estimate
has been reported in accordance to Listing Rule 5.12, refer to Appendix 1 for further
information.

Recharge’s Managing Director, Felicity Repacholi, commented:
We are thrilled to announce the transformative acquisition of 100% of the Carter
Uranium Project in the USA. The project sits on the northern rim of the world-
renown Powder River Basin, a proven region for in-situ recovery uranium
production, with six permitted processing plants located within 300 kms,
including ASX-listed Peninsula Energy.
The Acadia Deposit with 3.7Mlbs at 1,250ppm eU O and the Mindy Deposit with
3 8
1.4Mlbs at 1,560ppm eU O immediately transform Recharge into an advanced
3 8
uranium exploration company. Given the multiple roll fronts identified at the
Project we see considerable potential to grow the resource base at the Project.
The timing is opportune, given the US government’s readoption of nuclear power,
and the entrance of large technology firms into the nuclear market, creating a
tailwind of vast fiscal support and private funding aimed at building a domestic
nuclear fuel cycle. Year-to-date US uranium production has already more than
tripled relative to last year’s total, driven mostly by operators based within the
Powder River Basin.
The appointment of uranium geologist Ben Vallerine, who has six years of in-
country experience exploring for uranium and 2.5 years as director of US-focused
uranium explorer Global Uranium and Enrichment, brings a deep skillset that will
be valuable in aiding Recharge in its goal to rapidly advance Carter. We look
forward to updating investors as we progress this exciting Project.”

Recharge Metals Limited (ASX: REC, Recharge or the Company) is pleased to
announce that it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire 100% ownership
of 26km2 of mining claims that host significant historic uranium resources within
the prolific Powder River Basin in the USA, together forming the Carter Uranium
Project (the Project and the Acquisition).
The Project is located in southeast Montana, close to the Wyoming border. Access
is via US Highway 212, approximately 75km kilometres from the town of Belle
Fourche, South Dakota.
Figure 2: Carter Uranium Project location and historical resources
The Project was intensely explored by numerous major mining and energy
companies during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Uranium exploration was focused
on the northern rim (extension) of the Powder River Basin from Wyoming into
Montana.
Kerr McGee, one of the largest uranium producers during this era, in its joint
venture with Chevron, was particularly active in the area and drilled thousands of
www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 3

reconnaissance and closer-spaced delineation holes on, and around, Recharge’s
Project. Recharge has purchased a large database of exploration data and is
currently compiling and reviewing the wealth of information.
The Carter Uranium Project is within 250 kilometres of six (6) permitted ISR
uranium production facilities (refer Figure 1). ISR accounts for the vast majority of
USA production2, and the Powder River Basin has an extensive In Situ Recovery
(ISR) uranium production history. This started on an experimental basis during the
early 1960s, with the first commercial mine commencing operations in 1974.
The Carter Uranium Project hosts a significant amount of uranium mineralisation
with the deposits extending over a strike extent of approximately 11 kilometres. The
mineralisation, which is related to an extensive system of roll fronts, is hosted in
discrete uranium deposits, and along the oxidation-reduction interfaces
throughout the area.
Acadia Property
The Acadia Property covers an estimated 87% of the Acadia historical resource. The
Acadia historical resource estimate of approximately 3.7 Mlbs U O in 2.1M tonnes
3 8
at a grade of 1,250ppm eU O with an average thickness of about 2.4 metres.

www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 4

The Acadia Property covers an area of close-spaced drilling by Kerr McGee in joint
venture with Chevron that identified a roll front traceable for approximately 4
kilometres in the Fall River Sandstone of the Cretaceous Inyan Kara Group.
At least 254 holes were drilled, mostly on 30m spacing along fences at 150 metre
intervals along strike.
The drilling identified uranium mineralisation at depths of 420 to 445m. The
uranium zone was found in the A1 and A2 numbered roll fronts in the Fall River
formation of Early Cretaceous age. They exhibit a sinuous shape in plan view and
are 15.24 to 30.48m wide, with an average thickness of about 2.4m, at a Grade times
Thickness (GT) cut-off of 900 (1.8m at 500ppm eU O ).

Significant intercepts include:
• 1.83m @ 5,400ppm eU O from 438m
3 8
• 3.35m @ 2,000ppm eU O from 430m
3 8
• 3.65m @ 1,700ppm eU O from 430m

Refer to Appendix 2 for complete results.
Several excellent areas with strong potential for expanding the resource have been
identified within the surrounding ground held by Recharge.
Mindy Property
The Mindy Property covers an estimated 78% of the Mindy historical resource. The
Mindy historical resource estimate of approximately 1.4 Mlbs U O in 0.45M tonnes
3 8
at a grade of 1,560ppm eU O with an average thickness of about 2 metres.

Figure 44: Mindy Property with Historical Resource Outline and Drillholes
www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 5

The Mindy Property covers an area of close-spaced drilling by Kerr McGee in joint
venture with Chevron that identified a roll front traceable for approximately 7
kilometres in the Fall River Sandstone of the Cretaceous Inyan Kara Group.
The sandstone hosted uranium mineralisation occurs at a depth of about 290
metres below surface. The known mineralised portions of the roll front are defined
by at least 226 holes drilled by Kerr McGee and Chevron.
Significant intercepts include:
• 2.74m @ 2,900ppm eU O from 288m
3 8
• 1.83m @ 2,600ppm eU O from 295.9m
3 8
• 2.13m @ 2,100ppm eU O from 288m
3 8
• 2.43m @ 1,600ppm eU O from 295.9m
3 8
Refer to Appendix 2 for complete results.
Exploration Potential and Strategy
A thorough review of the historical drill data is continuing. A number of targets
have been identified from the preliminary data review, providing potential for
discovery of mineralised extensions and new zones of uranium mineralisation that
are not incorporated in the historical resource estimate.
Numerous target areas with potential for expanding the mineralised roll fronts are
held by the Company. These areas cover known roll front targets with significant
but fewer close-spaced drill holes than the aforementioned properties.
Historical data from the identified roll fronts within the Carter Project indicate:
• Historical resource areas are open along strike in one or both directions
which offer potential for defining extensions of the mineralised zones; and
• Areas of encouraging drill results not previously followed-up that could lead
to further discoveries along the known roll fronts.
Data compilation, data review and target generation is ongoing. Permitting work
has commenced with drilling planned for next year.
BOARD APPOINTMENT
Experienced uranium geologist and company executive, Mr Ben Vallerine has been
appointed as Non-Executive Director. Ben brings over 20 years of experience in the
international mining industry with a specific focus on US exploration, as well as US-
based operational experience, to the board. The appointment of Mr Vallerine is
highly complementary to the acquisition of the Carter Uranium Project in the USA.
As Country Manager and Director of US-focused uranium explorer Black Range
Minerals, Ben resided in the US for 6 years. Ben was responsible for building a
portfolio of over 90Mlbs of U O through successful exploration and acquisition in
3 8
Colorado and Wyoming.
More recently Ben served as a director of Global Uranium and Enrichment
(ASX:GUE) and was instrumental in assembling their high-quality portfolio of
uranium assets in the USA and Canada.
Ben is currently the Managing Director of Koba Resources (ASX:KOB) which is
actively exploring for uranium in South Australia and Canada, Koba also maintains
a portfolio of US Cobalt assets.

APPENDIX 1
Reporting in accordance with Listing Rule 5.12 Background
ASX Listing Rule 5.12 sets out the parameters whereby historic mineral resource
estimates can be reported on the ASX. Accordingly, in addition to the disclosure in
the body of this announcement, Recharge provides the following information
regarding the historic mineral resource estimate for the Acadia and Mindy
deposits.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.1 – The source and date of the foreign resource estimates
of mineralisation.
The historical resource estimates ("Acadia and Mindy Historical Resource
Estimates") have been extracted from the National Instrument 43-101 Technical
Report entitled Kilgore Minerals Limited – Montana & Wyoming Uranium
Properties dated 11 June 2007. The Report was prepared by James R. Guilinger of
World Industrial Minerals, LLC.
The report estimates that Acadia contains 3,700,000 pounds of U O at a grade of
3 8
1,250ppm U O . The Company estimates that 87.36% of this resource is located
3 8
within properties it controls.
The report estimates that Mindy contains 1,400,000 pounds of U O at a grade of
3 8
1,560ppm U O . The Company estimates that 77.72% of this resource is located
3 8
within properties it controls.
5.12.2 – Whether the foreign resource estimates of mineralisation use
categories of mineralisation other than those defined in JORC Code 2012 and if
so, an explanation of the differences.
The Acadia and Mindy historical resource estimates were prepared in support of
mining and, at the time, was considered to have been estimated with best practice,
early computer technology had been utilised.
The historical resource estimate is reported using a cutoff grade of 500ppm eU O
3 8
and a thickness cutoff of 1.8 m (6 ft) for a minimum grade/thickness cutoff of
900ppm GT (ppm x m).
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.3 – The relevance and materiality of the foreign resource
estimates of mineralisation to the entity.
The Acadia and Mindy historical resource estimates are considered by Recharge to
be both relevant and of significant materiality to an assessment of the value of the
Carter Uranium Project as they provide an indication of scale and grade as well as
a level of context and background for the potential development of the Project.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.4 – The reliability of the foreign resource estimates of
mineralisation, including reference to any criteria in Table 1 of JORC Code 2012
which are relevant to understanding of the reliability of the foreign resource
estimates of mineralisation.
It is the opinion of Recharge that the historical resource estimates are reliable and
represent the results of work done to reasonable standards, using reasonable
downhole logging, quality sampling, testing and geological interpretation.
www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 10

The resource calculation sheets used and generated were not available for
examination.
Downhole radiometric data was used to estimate U O grades. The intercepts were
3 8
posted on drill maps and included collar elevation, depth to the top of the
mineralised intercept, thickness of mineralisation, grade of mineralisation, and
depth of hole. Data entry was checked and confirmed. Drill hole locations were
digitised from drill maps to create coordinate listings and then plotted. The
resultant drill maps were then checked and confirmed by overlaying with the
original maps.
Radiometric log interpretation was spot checked by the authors for available logs
and as previously discussed geophysical log interpretation followed standard
methods.
No samples or sample collection data was available for scrutiny by the Report
authors. Core and/or drill samples are not available; however, original lithologic logs
and copies of commercial laboratory certificates for a very limited number of
chemical analysis of cores are available. The amount of analytical data is not
considered meaningful. There is no discussion in the information reviewed
concerning sample and assay quality controls and security. The authors of the
NI43-101 Report believed that the information provided follows generally accepted
practices in place during the 1970-1980 time period for the manner in which the
samples and assays were collected and analysed.
Appendix 3 contains further information with reference to the criteria in Sections
1, 2, and 3 of Table 1 of the JORC Code, to the extent considered relevant to
understanding the reliability of the historical mineral estimates referred to in this
announcement.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.5 – To the extent known, a summary of the work programs
on which the foreign resource estimates of mineralisation are based and a
summary of the key assumptions, mining and processing parameters and
methods used to prepare foreign resource estimates of mineralisation.
The Acadia area was extensively drilled by Kerr McGee Corp. in the 1970-1981 period.
Kerr McGee drilled over 500 holes in the Acadia area and defined uranium
mineralisation at depths of 420 to 445m (1380 to 1460 ft).
There are a total of 42 mineralised holes in the Acadia area that average 8 feet (2.43
meters) with an average grade of 1,250 eU O .
3 8
The Mindy area was extensively drilled by Kerr McGee in the 1970s. Kerr McGee
drilled an estimated 226 holes and defined an historic uranium mineralised zone
at depths of 274 to 299m (900 to 980 ft).
There are a total of 30 mineralised holes in the Mindy area that average 6.5 feet (1.98
meters) with an average grade of 1,560 eU O .
3 8
The historical resource estimate is reported using a cutoff grade of 0.05% eU O
3 8
and a thickness cutoff of 1.8 m (6 ft) for a minimum grade/thickness cutoff of 900
GT.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.6 – Any more recent estimates or data relevant to the
reported mineralisation available to the entity.
www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 11

Recharge is not aware of any recent estimates or data relevant to the Acadia and
Mindy Properties.
The Company is aware that portions of the project area were held by other parties
circa 2005-2015 but no drilling was completed.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.7 – The evaluation and/or exploration work that needs to
be completed to verify the foreign resource estimates of mineralisation as
mineral resources or reserves in accordance with JORC Code 2012.
Recharge has commenced a program of evaluation work that includes a review of
historical drilling data and other geological assessments.
Resource definition drilling will also be completed by Recharge to support a JORC
2012 Mineral Resource Estimate at the Acadia Property and the Mindy Property.
Prior to declaring a JORC compliant mineral resource, the Company will be
undertaking its own estimation work as required under the 2012 JORC Code which
will include site visits, geological interpretation, data assimilation, new estimation
and modelling techniques, assessment of relevant environmental factors and
assumptions regarding mining methods, processing and potential dilution.
ASX Listing Rule 5.12.8 – The proposed timing of any evaluation and/or
exploration work that the entity intends to undertake and a comment on how
the entity intends to fund that work.
The Company will complete resource definition drilling following the completion
of data review and acquiring any required permits. It is working towards an initial
drilling program in 2025.

APPENDIX 3
JORC Code 2012 Table 1
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections)
Criteria Commentary
Sampling • The Carter Uranium Project has been sampled by drilling campaigns
techniques predominately in the 1970s and 1980s. Recharge owns a partial data
package of the original Kerr McGee drilling data.
• Downhole instruments were utilised to measure natural gamma emission
from the rock formation and produce downhole logs.
• Natural gamma data from a calibrated sonde was utilised to generate an
analog record (log) of the drill hole.
• Gamma scales, K-factors, water factors, and deadtimes for the log gamma
curves are available for the individual logs. The geophysical logging units
were calibrated at the standard U.S. Department of Energy uranium logging
test pits.
• The gamma logs were analysed to provided estimations of equivalent
uranium grades.
• Natural Gamma was typically interpreted on half-foot intervals which is
standard for the USA uranium industry.
• Recharge will be completing exploration work to verify the available data.
Drilling • Drilling at the Carter Uranium Project consisted of vertical drill holes,
techniques approximately 4 – 6 inches in diameter.
• The drilling method employed was primarily standard circulation mud
rotary drilling using conventional, truck mounted drilling rigs.
• Diamond drilling was completed on a limited number of drillholes, specific
technique details are currently unknown.
Drill sample • Recovery data is not available.
recovery • Mud rotary recoveries are considered immaterial to the resource estimation
process as no physical samples are used for the resource estimation.
Logging • Geological logs are available for a limited number of the drillholes.
• Geophysical logs are available for a limited number of drillholes. The
geophysical logs provide quantitative analyses of natural gamma counts per
second (CPS) which are recorded at a sufficient level of detail to be used for
eU O grade calculations. The factors applied to convert the CPS data to
3 8
grades and thicknesses can be qualitative in nature.
• Where geophysical data is available, the entire lengths of the drill holes were
logged. Where the Natural Gamma CPS curves exceeded the logging scale,
the high gamma intervals were re-logged at a greater CPS logging scale to
measure the full amplitude of the gamma measurements.
Sub-sampling • No samples or sample collection data was available for scrutiny by the
techniques Competent Person.
and sample • Natural Gamma was typically interpreted on half-foot intervals which is
preparation standard for the USA uranium industry.
• Calibration facilities for down hole gamma logging units have been
standardised in the US since the early 1960s and have been maintained by
the US Department of Energy or its predecessors continuously since that
time.
Quality of • The data is limited to eU3O8 calculations based on data supplied by a
assay data downhole gamma sonde.
and laboratory • Copies of commercial laboratory certificates for a limited number of
tests chemical analysis of core are available. The amount of analytical data is not
considered meaningful. There is no discussion in the information reviewed
concerning sample and assay quality controls and security.
• It is assumed that the information provided generally follows accepted

logged. Where the Natural Gamma CPS curves exceeded the logging scale,
the high gamma intervals were re-logged at a greater CPS logging scale to
measure the full amplitude of the gamma measurements. |  |

Geology • Uranium deposits that occur within the project are of the “roll front” type.
• Roll fronts occur in areas where ground water had infiltrated from the
surface or migrated through an aquifer composed of sediment containing
minerals with slight amounts of uranium. Near the surface, oxidising
conditions result in the weathering of minerals (such as feldspar) and
volcanic ash and the mobilisation of minute concentrations of uranium in
solution. As ground water continued to migrate, it encountered reducing
conditions where the uranium was no longer stable in solution. (The
reducing environment may be a result of hydrogen sulphide (H S), pyrite, or
2
organic material existing in the aquifer.)
• As a result, the uranium precipitated from the ground water and formed
coatings of minerals such as uraninite (UO ) or coffinite (USiO ) on the

sediment grains in the formation. Roll fronts extend farther in the middle of

of flow, resulting in distorted C-shaped or “roll shaped” deposits. The physical
