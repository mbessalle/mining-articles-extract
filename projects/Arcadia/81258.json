    "description": "9\" December 2024 ECHARGE ASX Release | ASX: REC A rechargemetals.com.au M = T A 4 S Completion of Advanced High-Grade Carter Uranium Project Acquisition Recharge Metals Limited (ASX: REC) (Recharge or the Company) is pleased to confirm that it has completed the acquisition of the Carter Uranium Project and a A$2.52 million share placement to advance exploration activities at Carter. The Carter Uranium Project is located on the northern outer rim of the prolific Powder River Basin in the USA and is host to significant historic uranium resources. The Project is within 250 kilometres of six (6) permitted ISR uranium production facilities. The Project was intensely explored by numerous major mining and energy companies during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Kerr McGee, one of the largest uranium producers during this era, in its joint venture with Chevron, was particularly active in the area and drilled thousands of reconnaissance and closer- spaced delineation holes on, and around, Recharge’s Project. The Carter Uranium Project hosts a significant amount of uranium mineralisation with the deposits extending over a strike extent of approximately 11 kilometres. The Acquisition was completed today on the terms outlined previously in the Company's announcement dated 29 October 2024. Recharge has now completed a placement to raise A$2.52 million (before costs)(Placement) through the issue of 100,800,000 new fully paid ordinary shares (Placement Shares). The Placement Shares were issued to sophisticated and professional investors without disclosure under section 708 of the Corporations Act. Shareholder approval for the issue of the Placement Shares and completion of the acquisition was gained on 28\" November 2024. The Placement Shares rank equally with existing fully paid ordinary shares in the Company. Recharge is now fully funded to undertake its exploration activities. Recharge has commenced permitting work, with drilling planned for next year. Data compilation, data review and target generation is ongoing. -ENDS- This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Recharge Metals Limited.

Carter contains the majority of two significant high-grade historical resources, including The Acadia Deposit (3.7 Mibs @ 1,250ppm eUz0s) and the Mindy Deposit (1.4 Mlbs @ 1,560ppm eUzOs). The projects give investors exposure to the uranium theme, as well as the growing tailwinds of US fiscal support for development of domestic uranium industry. In addition, Recharge is advancing the Newnham Lake Uranium Project in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, the Express Lithium Project in Quebec and the copper-focused Brandy Hill South Project, Western Australia. 520000mE 530000mE Peg J Acadia Property . ) ECHARGE ~ S000000mN PSS a i NN Carter Uranium N\\ 3.7 Mibs eU;0 Project = = « SN ~~ v2, Mindy Property NL IMAL Tr s WIE os0000my Iv ~ 14MibseUs0; @ 1560 ppm eUs0 Ridge Road & [EE Recharge Metals Project 0 Skim ~~ Historical Uy0g resource —) Figure 1: Carter Uranium Project location and historical resources **Cautionary Statement: Historical Resource Estimate: Readers are cautioned that the historical resource estimates for the Acadia and Mindy Deposits, referred to in this Announcement are not reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. A Competent Person has not undertaken sufficient work to classify the historical resource estimates as mineral resources in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. Nothing has come to the attention of Recharge that causes it to question the accuracy or the reliability of the former owner's estimates. However, Recharge has not independently validated the former owner's estimates and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those estimates. Following evaluation and further exploration work, it is uncertain whether it will be possible to report this historical resource estimate as a mineral resource in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code.
