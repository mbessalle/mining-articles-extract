Intersections include: o 183m @ 5,400ppm eUz;Os from 438m o 335m @ 2,000ppm eUsOs from 430m o 3.65m @ 1,700ppm eUsOs from 430m o 274m @ 2,900ppm eUsOg from 288m e Considerable potential for resource expansion remains with multiple additional roll fronts mapped within the Carter Project e Experienced uranium geologist, Ben Vallerine appointed as Non-Executive Director, Ben brings significant US experience to the Board. e Recharge to raise $2.5 million to fund exploration over the next 12 months **Cautionary Statement: Historical Resource Estimate: Readers are cautioned that the historical resource estimates for the Acadia and Mindy Deposits, referred to in this Announcement are not reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. A Competent Person has not undertaken sufficient work to classify the historical resource estimates as mineral resources in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. Nothing has come to the attention of Recharge that causes it to question the accuracy or the reliability of the former owner's estimates. However, Recharge has not independently validated the former owner's estimates and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those estimates. Following evaluation and further exploration work, it is uncertain whether it will be possible to report this historical resource estimate as a mineral resource in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The historical resource estimate has been reported in accordance to Listing Rule 5.12, refer to Appendix 1 for further information. 1 Refer ASX:PEN Announcement dated 13\" May 2024 www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 1 ABN 13 647 703 839 T: + 61 (08) 9481 0389 -—\" LEVEL 8, LONDON HOUSE, 216 ST GEORGES TERRACE PERTH WA 6000  MONTANA (%) WYOMING Carter Uranium Project @ Sheridan ry [J Belle Lance Fourche Buffalo = R | Gillette @ North Butte Irigaray Cameco UEC [) [) Reno Tisec [J] LJ [) ck R ] ECHARGE _ L. : Ld UEC Dey Bick [) Q Smith Ranch-Highland Cameco Ld [J @ ° Casper . ° echarge Metals Project Crow Butte [J Cameco @ central Processing Plant ® Significant Uranium Project Figure 1: Carter Uranium Project with notable uranium facilities in the region Recharge’s Managing Director, Felicity Repacholi, commented: We are thrilled to announce the transformative acquisition of 100% of the Carter Uranium Project in the USA. The project sits on the northern rim of the world- renown Powder River Basin, a proven region for in-situ recovery uranium production, with six permitted processing plants located within 300 kms, including ASX-listed Peninsula Energy. The Acadia Deposit with 3.7Mlbs at 1,250ppm eUsOs and the Mindy Deposit with 1.4Mlbs at 1,560ppm eUsOs immediately transform Recharge into an advanced uranium exploration company. Given the multiple roll fronts identified at the Project we see considerable potential to grow the resource base at the Project. The timing is opportune, given the US government's readoption of nuclear power, and the entrance of large technology firms into the nuclear market, creating a tailwind of vast fiscal support and private funding aimed at building a domestic nuclear fuel cycle. Year-to-date US uranium production has already more than tripled relative to last year's total, driven mostly by operators based within the Powder River Basin. The appointment of uranium geologist Ben Vallerine, who has six years of in- country experience exploring for uranium and 2.5 years as director of US-focused uranium explorer Global Uranium and Enrichment, brings a deep skillset that will be valuable in aiding Recharge in its goal to rapidly advance Carter. We look forward to updating investors as we progress this exciting Project.” www.rechargemetals.com.au | ASX: REC 2 -_",
