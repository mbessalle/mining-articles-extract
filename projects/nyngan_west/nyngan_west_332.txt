commercial deals and making large scale copper-gold discoveries. Recently we have attracted
four industry partners and unlocked up to A$60m of multi-year funding. Nyngan West Project
We are very pleased to have opportunistically secured three bolt-on new projects covering

north-south strike extent of over 100km in the NJNB.
This new ground is adjacent to and on the interpreted extensions of the Nyngan and Nevertire
projects where maiden partner funded ground geophysical surveys are already ongoing with Fleet

AngloGold Ashanti at Nyngan.
The Company and our existing partners are very excited to commence the first ever copper-gold
exploration across potentially the largest volcano-intrusive complex of the Macquarie Arc at
northern Nyngan, which offers new district scale potential.

Pegged as open ground, Kincora has been awarded new exploration licenses covering a total of
1,377km2 (100% ownership) including the Nyngan West, Nyngan South and Nevertire South
projects - see Figures 1 to 3.
Project Summary Com
The new licenses are opportunistic new bolt-on projects with clear scale and value path, doubling
Kincora's land position in the NBJB. The NBJB is one of the two major volcanic belts of the
Macquarie Arc, where regional magnetics has proven to be effective in mapping the key belts and
major intrusive complexes.
The new licenses provide Kincora a continuous north-south strike extent of over 100km in the
interpreted shallow to moderate depth sections of the under cover extension of the Macquarie Arc. All Projects
The new licenses also consolidate the extensions of intrusive complex targets included in the
existing earn-in partnership with AngloGold Ashanti.
Regional geophysics strongly indicates that Kincora's Nyngan license has the potential to host the Other Company News
largest volcano-intrusive complex of the Macquarie Arc, which is currently almost untested with

Statement of CDIs on issue - KCC
Prior explorer drilling at the southern section of the Nevertire Magmatic Complex (within the
Nevertire South project) has returned anomalous copper-gold mineralisation, favourable fertility
defined by green rock analysis, geochemical zonation and alteration suggestive of an outer porphyry
system setting with age dates confirming a highly prospective Phase 4 Macquarie Arc intrusive
complex (at approximately 220m depth down hole). This supports Nevertire South being the most
advanced porphyry project within the NJNB district (see Figure 4), situated under potentially only
100 metres of cover and enhancing the value of the adjacent Nevertire project.
Kincora has recently secured three prior exploration drill holes from the Nevertire South project with
relogging planned as discussions with potential technical and funding partners progress.
About the NJNB Project Portfolio
The Macquarie Arc is Australia's premier porphyry copper-gold province and the undercover
extensions of the Arc are a globally significant exploration opportunity offering new district(s) scale
discovery potential. The region has recently attracted five major earn-in/option and joint venture
agreements supporting potentially over $300 million in exploration and development expenditure,
including the recent option and joint venture agreements between Gold Fields and privately owned
Gold & Copper Resources 4.
The most recent notable example of a new emerging globally significant porphyry district is the
Vicuña district in the central Andes in Argentina on the border of Chile, which is largely consolidated
by Lundin group entities and BHP and situated at over 4000m altitude. Within this district NGEx
Resources Inc in 2009 held three early stage exploration projects and at the time had a market
capitalisation of approximately C$40 million. These same projects are all still at a pre-development
phase but have yielded in four large-scale discoveries currently valued at over C$8.5 billion (see
Figure 2).
Regional geophysics strongly indicates that the largest sections of the Macquarie Arc still remain
untested under post mineral cover within the NJNB. Kincora was the early entrant securing a district
scale position in the interpreted shallow to moderate covered core sections of this region by pegging
Nyngan and Nevertire (covering now 939 km2).

Nevertire South projects (covering 1,377 km2) which are viewed as hosting shallow to moderate
covered sections of the targeted Macquarie Arc and the extensions of intrusive complex targets
included in the existing earn-in partnership with AngloGold Ashanti.
Kincora seeks to continue to systematically advance its project pipeline within the under cover
extension of the Macquarie Arc and bring in funding and technical partners.
About the AngloGold Ashanti Partnership
Kincora has an initial multiple-phase Earn-in and Joint Venture Agreement with AngloGold Ashanti
for the Nyngan and Nevertire licenses 5.
AngloGold has the right to spend up to A$50 million to earn a 80% interest through:
A$25 million of exploration expenditure to earn a 70% joint venture interest (Phase I)
including a minimum A$2 million expenditure obligation, with Kincora the initial operator for a
10% management fee.
Completion of a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) or funding of a further $25 million of expenditure
to earn a 80% joint venture interest (Phase II).
Under the agreement a wide range of untested large intrusive-related copper-gold targets will
be drill tested seeking to confirm the potential for a new district of copper-gold porphyry
system complexes.
AngloGold Ashanti is the world's fourth largest gold miner by production with a successful track
record for new Greenfield discovery success. Within the Macquarie Arc, AngloGold Ashanti has
secured Earn-in and Joint Venture Agreements with both Kincora and Inflection Resources
(Inflection, ticker "AUCU.CSE") covering greater than 8,000km2 in the NJNB.
Subject to permitting, access and weather conditions Kincora and AngloGold Ashanti's first drilling
program is anticipated to commence within the month. The program seeks to test new district-scale
potential with up to eight large intrusive complex targets to be drill-tested for the first time in this
initial first phase program. Approximately 6 to 8 drill holes for an estimated 4000-5000 metres are
budgeted to be complete before the summer break 6.

About Fleet Space Technologies Partnership
In July 2024, Kincora formed an initial partnership with Fleet Space for a three phase ANT and
gravity geophysical survey at the Nyngan project 7. These surveys commenced in early August, are
ongoing and progressing well.
The initial ANT survey is planned to cover an area of approximately 35 km2 across the northern
Nyngan license area with a proposed infill area of approximately 9 km2. Similar to other Fleet Space
surveys in the district, the ANT velocity model is anticipated to image down to 1900m depth with the
ground gravity surveys to provide the first cover-corrected gravity dataset in the area.
The rapid turnaround from completion of the surveys to interpretation of results is enabled by the
real-time ANT data acquisition capabilities of Fleet Space's end-to-end mineral exploration solution,
ExoSphere. Utilising Fleet Space's proprietary satellite constellation, ExoSphere's smart seismic
sensors (Geodes) transmit high-quality 3D ANT data from the project to the satellites which is then
processed into actionable insights in real-time. Leveraging the benefits of satellite connectivity, rapid

and AI-powered drill targeting with near-zero environmental impact. This process enables a faster
and more efficient end-to-end data journey, making exploration activities more dynamic and precise
by giving onsite teams access to actionable insights in real-time.
In the last quarter, Barrick Gold announced their partnership with Fleet Space to survey copper
porphyry complexes and groundwater systems across 1,150km² of the world-class Reko Diq project
8.
Fleet Space and Inflection also conducted the world's largest real-time ANT copper survey across
1818 km² and built an AI-powered district scale copper prospectivity map 9. The new targets
generated by ExoSphere led AngloGold Ashanti to accelerate their Exploration Agreement and
drilling with Inflection 10.
ExoSphere's rapid global adoption has propelled Fleet Space's exponential recent growth, including
a A$50 million Series C funding round, a doubling of its valuation to A$350 million, plans to send a
lunar variant of ExoSphere's Geode to the Moon in 2026, and recognition as Australia's fastest
growing company by the Australian Financial Review (2023).
