ASX RELEASE 
 
AuKing signs new Joint Venture for Koongie Park  
 
AuKing Mining Limited (ASX: AKN) is pleased to announce a new Joint Venture with 
ASX-listed Cobalt Blue Holdings Limited (ASX:COB) relating to the Koongie Park 
copper/zinc project in north-eastern Western Australia.  
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• 
New Earn-in Joint Venture: COB has a two-staged right to earn up to a 75% interest 
in Koongie Park, by incurring $2M of project expenditure over a 3 year period. 
• 
Metallurgical Expertise: COB brings considerable metallurgical expertise to the 
Koongie Park copper/zinc project – considered by AuKing to be a significant factor to 
advancing the project to feasibility study phases.  
• 
Issue of COB Sign-on shares: COB to issue $200k in ASX-listed COB shares to 
AuKing as part of establishment of the JV.  
• 
New JV Ensures Good Standing of Project Tenures: COB expenditure at Koongie 
Park will ensure the project tenures remain in good standing over the next 2-3 years, 
allowing AuKing to direct its financial resources to other key project activities (such as 
the Cloncurry gold and Mkuju uranium projects).    
• 
Significant Remaining Participating Interest: Depending on how far COB 
progresses with its earn-in rights, AuKing will hold a minimum 25% interest in the 
Koongie Park project when JV participating interests are established. This will remain 
a significant holding in the project, as its value increases with additional development 
activities.  
AuKing’s Managing Director, Mr Paul Williams, said that the new Joint Venture with 
Cobalt Blue is an excellent opportunity for AuKing, as it seeks to direct its primary funding 
resources towards the Cloncurry gold and Mkuju uranium projects for the foreseeable 
future.  
 
“This is a very good time to introduce COB to the Koongie Park project. Not only will they 
bring significant funding to the project but their metallurgical experience and expertise will 
provide considerable benefits at this stage of the project’s development. Further resource 
discovery and generation is important, but the 2023 Scoping Study previously identified that 
 
2 
there’s a viable project at Koongie Project if the metallurgical considerations for this 
polymetallic resource can be addressed. We look forward to working with COB as they take 
the project forward over the next couple of years,” Mr Williams said.  
 
Koongie Park Project Background 
AuKing has spent the past three years developing the Koongie Park copper/zinc project with 
activities including: 
• 
Substantial drilling at the existing Onedin and Sandiego deposits reporting results 
including: 
(AOWB003) – 124m @ 1.03% Cu, 1.08% Zn, 1.59% Pb and 50g/t Ag from 8m 
(AORD001) – 106m @ 0.53% Cu, 2,69% Zn and 10g/t Ag 
(AORD004) – 105m @ 1.94% Cu, 0.76% Zn, 55g/t Ag incl 
 
 
 
16m @ 10.2% Cu, 1.03% Zn and 316g/t Ag 
[See ASX releases by AuKing on 21 February and 24 February 2022 for further 
details] 
 
• 
Exploring and drilling the lower-grade (but larger tonnage) Emull deposit.  
• 
Upgrading the historical resource estimates at Onedin and Sandiego and reporting a 
maiden Emull resource estimate as follows: 
Sandiego: 
4.1Mt @ 1.40% Cu, 4.3% Zn, 0.2g/t Au, 25g/t Ag and 0.4% Pb 
Onedin: 
4.8Mt @ 0.70% Cu, 3.2% Zn, 0.1g/t Au, 38g/t Ag and 1.10% Pb 
Emull: 
12.2Mt @ 0.27% Cu, 0.38% Zn, 4.9g/t Ag and 0.09% Pb 
TOTAL JORC 2012 Resource:  21.1Mt 
[See more details about these resource estimates in the Annexure to this Report] 
• 
Conducting detailed ammonia-based and other metallurgical testwork for the 
predominantly polymetallic mineralization that occurs at Koongie Park.  
The project work undertaken by AuKing culminated in the delivery of a Scoping Study that 
was released in June 2023, reporting the following highlights: 
• 
11-year mine life, mining each of the Sandiego, Onedin deposits and nearby 
deposits currently owned by Cazaly Resources Limited 
• 
Estimated $134M development CAPEX 2.45 years payback 
• 
Pre-tax NPV8 of $177M (assuming a Life of Mine (LOM) copper price of US$3.90/lb) 
• 
39.7% IRR 
• 
LOM EBITDA $443.8M with average operating cashflow of $40.3M pa. 
[Disclosure Note: 
1. See ASX release by AKN 1 June 2023 for more details, including cautionary 
statements in relation to the Scoping Study findings. 
2. The Company is not aware of any material change to the material assumptions that 
were used in the Scoping Study underpinning the above forecast information.] 
 
3 
The results from this Scoping Study should now form the basis of future feasibility study 
work likely to be undertaken by COB as its activities at Koongie Park develop.  
 
COB Earn-in Joint Venture Terms 
 
A summary of the key terms of the agreement that has been reached with COB includes the 
following:  
 
Stage 1 
• 
(Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including deeds of assignment 
and assumption being executed by relevant third parties), COB will acquire a 51% 
beneficial interest in the Project by issuing AuKing with A$200k of COB shares (at an 
issue price of $0.072 – set at the same level as the recent COB rights issue) which 
are to be held in voluntary escrow by AuKing for a six month period;  
• 
To retain the 51% beneficial interest COB must meet a minimum expenditure of 
A$500k by 30 June 2027; 
• 
If COB does not meet this Stage 1 expenditure, AuKing can buy back a 2% interest 
(and return to a 51% interest) by reimbursing COB 2% of the amount of expenditure 
incurred by COB on the Project. 
Stage 2 
• 
COB will then have the right (but not the obligation) to earn up to a 75% interest (an 
additional 24%) in the Project by incurring an additional A$1.5M expenditure on the 
tenements by 30 June 2028; 
• 
If COB does not meet this Stage 2 expenditure, AuKing can buy back a 2% interest 
(and return to a 51% interest) by reimbursing COB 2% of the amount of expenditure 
incurred by COB on the Project; and 
• 
Should AuKing’s future JV interest dilute below 10% the interest shall revert to a 1% 
Net Smelter Royalty (‘NSR’).

Note: 
The Mineral Resource has been compiled under the supervision of Mr. Shaun Searle who is a director of Ashmore Advisory 
Pty Ltd and a Registered Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists. Mr. Searle has sufficient experience that is 
relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity that he has undertaken to 
qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the JORC Code.  
All Mineral Resources figures reported in the table above represent estimates at December 2022. Mineral Resource 
estimates are not precise calculations, being dependent on the interpretation of limited information on the location, shape and 
continuity of the occurrence and on the available sampling results. The totals contained in the above table have been 
rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimate. Rounding may cause some computational discrepancies.  
 
Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (The Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code – JORC 2012 Edition).
