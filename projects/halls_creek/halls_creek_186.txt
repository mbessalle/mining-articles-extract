COB Diversifies –  
Major Copper Project Earn in
KEY POINTS
Corporate Rebrand
a	
Cobalt Blue Holdings Limited (ASX: COB) (‘COB’ or ‘the Company’) is pleased 
to announce a proposed rebrand and change of name (subject to shareholder 
approval) to better reflect its expanded focus across a broader range of metals. 
The proposed new name, Core Blue Minerals Limited, aligns with COB’s 
expanded focus beyond cobalt into a diversified commodity portfolio.
Earn-In Agreement for major copper project 
a	
COB has entered into an Earn-in agreement (‘the Agreement’) with 
AuKing Mining Limited (‘AKN’) for the Halls Creek Project (the ‘Halls Creek 
Project’ or ‘the Project’); a large scale copper-lead-zinc-silver-gold asset 
with significant cobalt potential.
a	
The Agreement enables COB to leverage its extensive metallurgical, engi-
neering, and project development expertise to drive portfolio diversification.
a	
The Halls Creek Project hosts two major deposits with existing Mineral 
Resource estimates containing a combined 89kt copper (Cu), 69kt lead (Pb), 
326kt zinc (Zn), 9.2Moz silver (Ag) and 45koz gold (Au) including:	
a
Sandiego – Total of 4.1Mt (3.7Mt Indicated / 0.4Mt Inferred) at 1.4% 
Cu, 0.4% Pb, 4.2% Zn and 25g/t Ag for 56kt contained Cu, 18kt Pb, 
175kt Zn, 3.3Moz Ag, and 25koz Au; and	
a
Onedin – Total of 4.8Mt (Indicated) at 0.7% Cu, 1.1% Pb, 3.1% Zn 
and 38g/t Ag for 33kt contained Cu, 51kt Pb, 151kt Zn, 5.9Moz Ag 
and 20koz Au.	
a
96% of the total Mineral Resource tonnes are classified as Indicated.
a	
Geological modelling has highlighted substantial opportunity for high-grade 
extensions and or repetitions with deposits open along strike and at depth. 
Drilling by AKN has also intersected substantial zones of near surface 
oxide-transition-supergene copper mineralisation at the Onedin deposit with 
significant intersections including:	
a
55.1m at 3.5% Cu, 1.2% Pb, 0.8% Zn & 103g/t Ag from 94m 
(AORD004) including:
	
a
16.6m at 10.2% Cu, 0.5% Pb, 1.0% Zn & 316g/t Ag from 130m	
a
118m at 1.1% Cu, 1.6% Pb, 1.1% Zn & 52g/t Ag from 14m (AOWB03) 
including:
	
a
21m at 2.1% Cu & 66g/t Ag from 93m 
a	
The Project is favourably located within the Kimberley region of Western 
Australia; just 15km southwest of Halls Creek and 320km south of Wyndham 
port. The area has historically supported the Nicholsons Gold Mine and the 
Savannah Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Mine). The Project is supported by strong 
logistics support, including established road and port facilities.

MARKET UPDATE
2
Commenting on the corporate rebranding and Earn-in agreement, Cobalt Blue’s Chief Executive Officer, Joe Kaderavek said: “The 
Cobalt Blue name no longer reflects the full scope of our business. As our technical and project development expertise uncovers new 
opportunities across base and precious metals, a corporate rebrand marks a key milestone. While our commitment to delivering a 
strong battery materials strategy remains unchanged, we are actively expanding our portfolio with high-value projects that have the 
potential to enhance future earnings.
The Halls Creek Project Earn-in is a transformational step, broadening our commodity exposure and strengthening our resilience 
against future pricing cycles. We see immense development potential at Halls Creek and are well-positioned to unlock value through 
complementary initiatives—including the development of Australia’s first cobalt-nickel refinery.”
Proposed Corporate Rebrand 
Following the development of the ReMine+ business unit and the proposed Earn-in of the Halls Creek Project, COB has expanded 
its focus to include non-battery metals, extending beyond cobalt alone. Our three core business pillars remain unchanged, with the 
proposed Halls Creek Project Earn-in enhancing our technical and development expertise while reinforcing our long-term growth 
strategy.
Recognising this expanded focus, the Board of COB has endorsed a proposal to seek shareholder approval for a name change 
to Core Blue Minerals Limited. This transition acknowledges our diversified commodity exposure, providing economic resilience 
against individual metal pricing cycles. At the same time, it preserves the strong battery materials branding that is well recognised  
by governments, investors, and key stakeholders.
Importantly, the renaming will not impact the Company’s commitment to the Kwinana Cobalt Refinery (‘KCR’) and the Broken 
Hill Cobalt Project (‘BHCP’) and our partnership with Iwatani Corporation. These remain core projects for the Company, and we 
anticipate providing further updates, particularly on the KCR project, in 1H 2025.
The proposed name change is subject to shareholder approval, with a resolution to be included in the Notice of Meeting for a 
general meeting to be scheduled in Q2 2025. The Company’s ASX code will remain the same.
Halls Creek Project Earn-In Agreement
The key terms of the Agreement are as follows:
Stage 1
a	
Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including deeds of assignment and assumption being executed by 
relevant third parties, COB will acquire a 51% beneficial interest in the Project by issuing AKN with A$200,000 worth of COB 
shares (at an issue price of $0.072 – set at the same level as the recent rights issue), being 2,777,778 shares, which will be 
subject to escrow for a period of six months from the date of the Agreement. 			
a 
To retain the 51% beneficial interest COB must meet a minimum expenditure of A$500,000 by 30 June 2027.
Stage 2
a 
COB will then have the right (but not the obligation) to earn up to a 75% interest (an additional 24%) in the Project by incurring 
an additional A$1.5 million of expenditure on the tenements by 30 June 2028.
a 
Should AKN’s interest dilute below 10% the interest shall revert to a 1% Net Smelter Royalty (‘NSR’).
Strategic Rationale
The Halls Creek Project Earn-in provides commodity diversification, reducing exposure to cyclical lows in the global cobalt market. 
The low-cost entry structure of the agreement allows COB to progressively increase its beneficial interest in the Project while 
significantly advancing its technical development.
Crucially, the low capital intensity of the Earn-in obligations ensures COB can maintain financial flexibility, enabling the Company to 
pursue additional growth opportunities through ongoing business development initiatives.

Strong Market Outlook for Key Commodities
The global outlook for copper, silver, and gold remains strong, driven by robust short- and long-term fundamentals:
a	
Copper stands out as one of the most compelling investment opportunities, benefiting from strong demand growth and constrained 
supply. Essentially the “metal of electrification”, copper is fundamental in traditional industrial applications as well as vital to all 
energy transition plans. Already in strong demand among industrialising economies, global copper consumption is expected to 
continue to rise because of its critical role in electrification, decarbonisation technologies, spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools 
and data centres. Meanwhile, supply is expected to remain under pressure from decades of underinvestment, declining ore grades, 
long project lead times, and increasing resource nationalism. 
a	
Silver and gold offer additional exposure to strategic and financial metals. In the near term, falling U.S. interest rates, geopolitical 
uncertainty, and central bank buying provide strong tailwinds. Over the long term, rising global debt levels and growing demand 
for alternative stores of value are expected to further support gold’s role in financial markets.
The Halls Creek Project aligns our portfolio with long-term macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, reinforcing our position in metals 
that are essential to the global economy and the energy transition.
Synergies with Our Refinery and Future Feedstock Strategy
A key element of our growth strategy is the advancement of our Kwinana Cobalt Refinery, where we are actively pursuing oppor-
tunities to secure domestic feedstocks and expand our processing capabilities. The Halls Creek Project Earn-in aligns with this 
objective, creating the potential for integrated value chains that leverage our refining expertise and technical capabilities.
In addition, the agreement delivers the following advantages:
Diversification for Enhanced Resilience
The Halls Creek Project expands the Company’s portfolio beyond cobalt, adding copper, lead, zinc, silver, and gold to our 
commodity mix. This diversification enhances resilience against price volatility, creating a more balanced foundation for capital 
allocation and strategic planning. By reducing reliance on single-commodity cycles, the Company is strengthening its ability to adapt 
to market dynamics with greater agility and unlock new growth opportunities.

Unlocking Value through Technical Expertise
With a proven track record of technical excellence in project development and metallurgical innovation, COB is uniquely positioned 
to unlock the full potential of the Halls Creek Project. Our deep expertise in resource development and process optimisation will 
promote value creation while advancing the project efficiently. Integrating the Halls Creek Project Earn-in into our portfolio improves 
financial resilience, seizes market opportunities, and solidifies our business as a leading, diversified resource development company.
Halls Creek Project 
The Halls Creek Project is located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia; a mature mining jurisdiction with a significant record 
of resource production including iron ore, mineral sands, rare earths, nickel, copper, cobalt and gold. Located 15km southwest of 
Halls Creek (pop. ~3,500), the project comprises two significant deposits; Sandiego and Onedin. The deposits are directly adjacent 
to the Great Northern Highway which connects the Project to Kununurra and Wyndham Port, respectively some 300km and 320 km 
north. Wyndham Port is the only deep-water port between Broome and Darwin servicing exports including crude oil, live cattle, raw 
mined products, scrap metal and maize from across Northern Australia and produce from the Ord River irrigation area.

Other notable projects within the region include the:
a	
Nicholsons’ Gold Mine: Located approximately 15km west of the Project area, the Nicholsons Find gold mine was owned  
and operated by Pantoro Limited between 2015 and 2023, producing ~30koz gold per annum. 
a	
Savannah Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Mine: Located approximately 110km north of Halls Creek, the Savannah Nickel Mine was 
formerly operated by Panoramic Resources producing nickel-copper-cobalt concentrates which were exported via Wyndham 
port. Production ceased in 2024, and the project was recently acquired by Zeta Resources.
a	
Argyle Diamond Mine: Located approximately 180km northeast of Halls Creek and 110km southwest of Kununurra,  
The Argyle Diamond Mine was formerly operated by Rio Tinto. Over its 37-year life, the mine produced more than 865 million 
carats of rough diamonds—operations ceased in late 2020. 
a	
Browns Range Rare Earths Project: Located approximately 160km southeast of Halls Creek, the Browns Range Project is 
currently being advanced through a Definitive Feasibility Study. 
The Project has been subject to previous exploration by Billiton Australia Pty Ltd, Lachlan Resources NL, Anglo Australian 
Resources NL and AKN through various joint ventures. Since 1990, expenditure attributed to the main deposit areas totals some 
A$20 million providing the Company with a strong foundation upon which to advance Project development.
Mineral Resources
The Halls Creek Project is inclusive of two existing Mineral Resources including:
a	
Sandiego – 4.1Mt at 1.4% Cu, 0.4% Pb, 4.2% Zn and 25g/t Ag for 56kt contained copper, 18kt lead, 175kt zinc  
and 3.3Moz silver.
a	
Onedin – 4.8Mt at 0.7% Cu, 1.1% Pb, 3.1% Zn and 38g/t Ag for 33kt contained copper, 51kt lead, 151kt zinc  
and 5.9Moz silver.
The Mineral Resource estimates were independently prepared by ERM Australia Consultants Pty Ltd (‘ERM’, formerly CSA Global) 
and were originally released to ASX on 7 April 2022 by AKN.

Growth Potential
Geological modelling undertaken by AKN in support of the Sandiego and Onedin Mineral Resource estimates has substantially 
improved the understanding of structural controls on mineralisation. This understanding has highlighted significant opportunity for 
high-grade extensions and or repetitions within favourable host rocks and structures proximal to the main deposits and across the 
broader tenement portfolio. 
Alignment with Refinery
The potential to incorporate cobalt into future Mineral Resource estimates is subject to review with significant intersections from 
select drill holes at the Sandiego deposit, including:
a	
22m at 12.6% Cu, 1.3% Pb, 8.0% Zn, 0.17% Co & 121g/t Ag from 100m (SRCD031)

Geology and Geological Interpretation
Massive sulphide deposits at Sandiego and Onedin are hosted by the Koongie Park Formation comprising mafic and felsic 
volcanics, associated sediments including sandstone, mudstone, carbonate, chert and ironstone, and are intruded by rhyolitic to 
rhyodacitic sills, dolerite bodies and basalt dykes. Massive sulphide mineralisation is strata-bound, with disseminated sulphides 
overlaying the massive sulphides. Both deposits are interpreted to occur within the limbs of intensely folded, higher order, double-
plunging anticlinal structures. 
The massive sulphide deposits of the Halls Creek Project are classified as Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (‘VMS’) deposits. The mineralogy 
of the primary mineralisation at Sandiego is pyrite-sphalerite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite +/- galena, which is largely hosted in the magnetite-rich 
exhalative suite of rocks where it occurs as a massive conformable wedge-shaped lens 200m in length with a maximum thickness of 75m. 
At Onedin, sphalerite is the main sulphide in the primary mineralisation with subordinate pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-galena. Onedin 
comprises numerous stacked lenses of mineralisation with a folded and faulted geometry over a vertical extent of 400m.
Both deposits have a deep weathering profile (up to 250m below the surface), resulting in three weathering domains: an oxidised 
zone at the surface, a primary zone at depth, and a transition zone in between.
The geological interpretation supporting the Mineral Resource estimates was guided firstly by geology, and secondly by grade 
envelopes to constrain mineralisation. Zinc domains were based on nominal lower cut-off grades of 1.5 % Zn (Onedin) and 1.0 % Zn 
(Sandiego); copper domains were based on nominal lower cut-off grades of 0.4 % Cu (Onedin) and 0.5 % Cu (Sandiego). Internal 
dilution was permitted during the interpretation of the mineralisation domains, however it was limited to 3 m in most cases. Some 
overlap of the zinc and copper zones occurs. Weathering domains were interpreted for the Base of Complete Oxidation (‘BOCO’) 
and Top of Fresh (‘TOFR’) interfaces. The Onedin Mineral Resource extends along strike 300m, across strike by 200m and has a 
depth extent below surface of 400m. The Sandiego Mineral Resource extends along strike 300m, across strike by 200m and has  
a depth extent below surface of 600m.
Sampling and Sub-sampling Techniques 
Sampling and sub-sampling techniques have varied between phases of exploration at the Sandiego and Onedin deposits and are 
summarised in Table 4 for each respective period.
Table 4 – Summary of sampling and sub-sampling techniques since 1995
Period
Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques
Diamond Drilling
1995–1996
Diamond drilling was used to obtain core from which intervals averaging 1m in length were sawn to produce 
samples (typically quarter (25%) core). These samples were crushed, split and pulverised for analysis. Details of 
sub-sampling, lab preparation techniques are not recorded.
2006– 2011
Diamond drilling was used to obtain core from which intervals averaging 1m in length were sawn to produce 
quarter (25%) core or half (50%) core samples from HQ or NQ core respectively. These samples were crushed, split 
and pulverised to produce a sample for analysis. Details of sub-sampling and lab preparation techniques are not 
recorded.
2021
Diamond drilling was used to obtain core from which intervals averaging 0.95m in length were sawn to produce 
quarter (25%) core or half (50%) core samples from PQ3 / HQ3 or HQ core respectively. These samples were 
crushed (passing -10mm), riffle split and pulverised (80% passing -75µm) to produce a sample for analysis. 
RC Drilling
1995–1996
RC drilling was used to obtain 1m samples by means of a riffle splitter which were composited into 4m intervals 
for analysis. Composite samples returning Cu, Pb or Zn >1%, and or Au >1/g/t were typically re-assayed at 1m 
intervals. Details of sample compositing, sub-sampling and lab preparation techniques are not recorded.
2006–2008
RC drilling was used to obtain 4m composite samples by means of a sample ‘spear’. These samples were 
crushed, split and pulverised to produce a sample for analysis. Details of sub-sampling and lab preparation 
techniques are not recorded.
2010–2011
RC drilling was used to obtain 1m samples by means of a cone splitter. These samples were crushed, split and 
pulverised to produce a sample for analysis. Details of sub-sampling and lab preparation techniques are not 
recorded.
2021
RC drilling was used to obtain 1m samples by means of a cone splitter from which up to 3.5kg was pulverised 
(80% passing -75µm) to produce a sample for analysis. Samples >3.5kg were riffle split and pulverised (80% 
passing -75µm) to produce a sample for analysis.

Drilling Techniques
The Sandiego drilling database comprises drill holes completed from 1995 including 3 diamond drill holes, 53 reverse circulation 
(‘RC’) drill holes and 42 diamond drill holes with RC pre-collars (‘RCDD’) of varying depths. In addition, the database includes  
35 drill holes (27 diamond drill holes and 8 RC drill holes) for which no information regarding the date of drilling or details related  
to drilling techniques is recorded. A summary of the number of drill holes and drilling techniques since 1995 is provided in Table 5.

Mineral Resource Classification
The Mineral Resource models were classified based upon drill hole spacing, quality of sampling and sample analyses, quantity of 
density measurements, and the relative confidence in the geological interpretation. The Mineral Resource estimates are supported 
by confidence in the geological interpretations, sufficient to assume geological and grade continuity to satisfy an Indicated classifi-
cation. All blocks within the Onedin Mineral Resource are classified as Indicated in accordance with the JORC Code; the Sandiego 
Mineral Resource is classified as a combination of Indicated and Inferred.

Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology
A block model with block sizes 5m (X) x 10m (Y) x 10m (Z) was constructed for each deposit, with the individual blocks assigned 
to the local geological domains (mineralisation and weathering) and each interpolated with a Cu, Zn, Au and Ag grade. The block 
size adopted corresponds to approximately half the drill hole spacing. Drill samples were flagged by mineralisation and weathering 
domains, and the drill samples composited to 1m length intervals. Composited sample data were statistically reviewed to determine 
appropriate top-cuts, with top-cuts applied for Zn, Cu, Ag and Au where required. Variograms were modelled for Cu and Zn from 
top cut and composited sample data within their respective mineralisation domains. Low to moderate relative nugget effects were 
modelled across all mineralisation domains, with short ranges of approximately 50 m observed for both Zn and Cu.
Grade interpolation was caried out via Ordinary Kriging (‘OK’) for the Sandiego deposit, and via Inverse Distance Squared (‘IDS’) for the 
Onedin deposit. All sub-blocks were assigned the grade of their parent block. Sample search ellipse radii varied according to deposit 
and grade variable, with a sample search ellipse of up to 60m by 30m by 20m (perpendicular to strike) used for Cu and Zn interpolation 
at Sandiego, with a minimum of 8 samples and maximum of 24 samples used to interpolate grade into any one block. A maximum 
of 4 samples per drill hole was used for grade interpolation for each block. Search radii were increased, and the minimum number of 
minimum samples reduced in subsequent sample searches if cells were not interpolated in the first pass. Octant searches were not 
used. The interpolated grades were validated by way of review of cross sections (block model and drill samples presented with same 
colour legend); swath plots, and comparison of mean grades from drillhole data with block model grades.
Mineral Resource Cut-Off Grades
The Mineral Resources have been reported above Cu and Zn cut-off grades of 0.8% Cu and 3% Zn (Sandiego), and 0.4% Cu and 
1% Zn (Onedin). The basis for the selection of the cut-off grades reflects the anticipated mining methods for the respective deposits, 
with underground operations (such as is anticipated for Sandiego) requiring higher reporting cut-off grades than would be used 
for an open pit Mineral Resource. The cut-off grades used to report the Sandiego Mineral Resource are the same as have been 
historically used for reporting earlier Mineral Resource estimates. 
For both Mineral Resources, in the case of overlapping Zn and Cu zones, the Zn block grade has been preferentially reported over 
the Cu block grade.

Mining and Metallurgical Methods and Modifying Factors
The Halls Creek Project (inclusive of the Sandiego and Onedin Mineral Resources) was the subject of a Scoping Study completed 
in May 2023 (‘2023 Scoping Study’) by Wave International on behalf of AKN. The Mineral Resource estimates were independently 
prepared by ERM (formerly CSA Global) and were originally released to ASX on 7 April 2022 by AKN.
A summary of modifying factors considered at the time of the Mineral Resource estimation and subsequently subject to further 
assessment during completion of the 2023 Scoping Study is provided below. 
Mining Method and Parameters
In 2022, at the time of the Mineral Resource estimation, it was anticipated that the Onedin deposit would be mined using open cut 
methods, while the Sandiego deposit would be mined largely as an underground operation. On that basis, different cut-off grades 
for the individual deposits and discrete copper and zinc zones were applied. 
The mining study completed for the 2023 Scoping Study demonstrated that:
a	
the Onedin deposit is amendable to open cut mining; and
a	
the Sandiego deposit is amendable to underground mining.
Processing Method and Parameters
Anglo Australian Resources completed extensive metallurgical testwork to inform Feasibility Studies between 2008 and 2011. The 
testwork considered a range of mineralisation types from the Sandiego and Onedin deposits. The results of the testwork demon-
strated sulphide mineralisation at Sandiego and Onedin can be concentrated at satisfactory metallurgical recoveries to produce 
commercial grade concentrates. Comparatively, processing of oxide-transition material was regarded as challenging. 
For the purposes of the 2023 Scoping Study, the process flowsheet contemplated inclusion of a sulphidisation plant as a ‘base-
case’ for treatment of oxide-transition material, while other processing methodologies were investigated. Further testwork is required 
to identify the most appropriate processing pathway for the oxide-transition material.
Other Material Modifying Factors
Tenure
The Sandiego and Onedin deposits are hosted within existing Mining Leases M 80/276 and M 80/277 respectively—the Mining 
Leases expire in 2031.
Environmental 
Project development has the potential for environmental impacts caused by the generation of acid mine drainage (‘AMD’) and 
depletion of groundwater resources. The Sandiego and Onedin deposits comprise both sulphidic mineralisation and waste rock 
which has the potential to oxidise when exposed to air and water. Further characterisation of mineralised and waste material (waste 
rock and tailings) will be required to inform the development of a long-term closure strategy as part of future studies.
Other key environmental factors will need to be considered in future studies including though not limited to biodiversity, groundwater, 
surface water, air quality, social and community.
Cultural Heritage and Native Title
Mining Leases M 80/276 and M 80/277 are located within the Koongie and Lamboo Elvire Native Title Claims. The Mining Leases 
are unencumbered by Native Title Agreements as the tenements were granted prior to the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).

Drill sample 
recovery
a	 Method of recording and assessing 
core and chip sample recoveries and 
results assessed.
a	 Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative 
nature of the samples.
a	 Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and 
whether sample bias may have 
occurred due to preferential loss/gain 
of fine/coarse material.
Diamond Drilling
a	
Between 1995 and 1996, core recoveries were quantified through 
measurement of actual core recovered versus drilled intervals. 
Diamond drilling typically used a HQ3 triple tube configuration to 
maximise recovery through strongly weathered rock, reducing to 
standard NQ2 on intersection of competent rock. Core recoveries 
are recorded for approximately 46% of metres drilled during the 
respective period and averaged 99%. 
a	
Between 2006 and 2010, core recoveries were quantified 
through measurement of actual core recovered versus drilled 
intervals. Diamond drilling typically used standard HQ2 and NQ2 
configurations with core loss generally attributed to fault zones 
characterised by a high fracture frequency. Core recoveries are 
recorded for approximately 91% of metres drilled during the 
respective period and averaged 95%.
a	
During 2021, core recoveries were quantified through measure-
ment of actual core recovered versus drilled intervals. Diamond 
drilling typically used standard HQ2 / NQ2 and PQ3 / HQ3 triple 
tube configurations. Core recoveries are recorded for approxi-
mately 88% of metres drilled during the year and averaged 94%.
a	
No relationship between sample recovery and grade has been 
observed.
RC Drilling
a	
Between 1995 and 1996, sample recoveries achieved by RC 
drilling were typically estimated through observation of the volume 
of the bulk samples. Where recorded the estimates denoted 
recovery as a range between 0 and 100%. Accepting the inherent 
subjectivity of the estimates, recoveries generally averaged 100%. 
Estimated recoveries are recorded for approximately 65% of the 
RC metres drilled during the respective period.
a	
Between 2006 and 2011, sample recoveries achieved by RC 
drilling were estimated through observation of the volume of the 
bulk samples. Where recorded the estimates denoted recovery as 
a range between 0 and 100%. Accepting the inherent subjectivity 
of the estimates, recoveries generally averaged 100%, however 
estimates are only recorded for a relatively insignificant (1%) 
proportion of the RC metres drilled during the respective period.

exploration results presented herein. The total proportion of 
logging recorded in the database represents 97% of metres drilled 
since 1995 (i.e., 33,968m of 35,117m). This logging has been 
completed to a level of detail considered to accurately support 
Mineral Resource estimation. The parameters logged include 
lithology, mineralisation and oxidation. These parameters are both 
qualitative and quantitative in nature.

All diamond drill core sampled up to 2006 was relogged by an 
independent consultant from ERM Australia Consultants Pty 
Ltd (‘formerly CSA Global) to ensure consistency. The same 
geological logging template was used for subsequent diamond 
drilling up to 2010.
a	
Diamond drilling completed since 2006 has typically been subject 
to geotechnical logging with parameters recorded including 
rock quality indices (e.g., rock quality designation (‘RQD’)) and 
geotechnical defects such as fracture frequency.
a	
Digital core photography for drilling completed in 2021 is retained in 
both wet and dry states. Core photographs from drilling completed 
prior to 2021 are available in historical reports (typically in PDF 
format) though the completeness of these records is unknown.

a	
The nature and quality of all assaying and laboratory procedures 
employed for samples obtained through drilling (diamond and 
reverse circulation) are considered ‘industry standard’ for the 
respective periods.
1995–1996 
a	
Analysis was primarily conducted via AAS for Cu, Pb, Zn, and Ag, 
with Au variably analysed by fire assay.
a	
Samples were crushed, split, and pulverised before analysis; 
however, details on lab preparation and digestion techniques were 
not recorded.
a	
AAS is a well-established method for base metals, but it is a 
partial digestion technique and may not completely dissolve 
resistant mineral phases, potentially leading to under-reporting of 
some elements. 
2006–2011 
a	
Analysis was primarily conducted via mixed-acid digestion 
followed by ICP-MS or ICP-OES. Au was analysed by fire assay 
with a 40–50g charge and AAS finish.
a	
Samples were crushed, split, and pulverised; however, details of 
lab preparation techniques were not recorded.
a	
Mixed-acid digestion is a strong, near-total digestion method 
capable of dissolving most sulphide minerals but may not fully 
capture elements hosted in refractory silicates. 
2021 
a	
Analysis was primarily conducted via mixed-acid digestion and 
ICP-OES for a suite of 39 elements, with Au analysed by fire 
assay using a 30g charge and AAS finish.
a	
Samples were crushed to pass -10mm, riffle split, and pulverised 
before analysis.
a	
The use of mixed-acid digestion and ICP-OES is appropriate 
for base metals and provides near-total digestion. The reduced 
Au charge (30g vs. 40–50g in previous campaigns) may slightly 
impact detection accuracy but remains industry standard.
a	
To monitor the accuracy of assay results from drilling completed in 
2021, Certified Reference Material samples (‘CRMs’) and blanks 
were inserted into the sample stream: 
	
a
A total of 30 blank samples were inserted into the sample 
sequence to monitor potential contamination. Results indi-
cated generally acceptable levels of accuracy, but instances 
of contamination in high-grade zones require further review.
	
a
A total of 113 CRMs from Geostats Pty Ltd and OREAS 
were included across 25 assay batches, covering a range 
of expected copper and zinc values. Performance varied, 
with multiple failures outside ±3 standard deviations (‘SD’), 
particularly for zinc assays. he high failure rate, particularly in 
zinc assays, raises concerns regarding systematic biases in 
laboratory analysis. While some results may be attributed to 
CRM misallocation, the overall frequency of failures suggests 
potential issues with laboratory accuracy.
	
a
No umpire laboratory checks were conducted.
a	
The Competent Person preparing the Mineral Resource estimates 
reviewed the QAQC data and determined that while sampling and 
assaying results pose a low to moderate risk to confidence levels 
in the Mineral Resource estimate, systematic issues with CRM 
performance warrant further investigation. As such, the Company 
intends to undertake a comprehensive audit of historical drilling, 
sampling, sub-sampling and analytical data to inform develop-
ment of the forward work program for the Project.

a	
All exploration is considered to have been completed to a reason-

drilling, sampling, sub-sampling and analytical data is incomplete. 
Where sufficient confidence cannot be established as to data 
quality, it cannot be used to inform Mineral Resource estimation. 
Notwithstanding this the cumulative advancement of geological 
knowledge provided by historical exploration is significant.

A summary of historical exploration is provided below:
	
a
1972–1977: Kennecott pegged tenements over known 
copper-lead-zinc-silver gossans as part of its Gordon Downs 
3 project. Work included geological and structural mapping, 
rock chip and soil sampling, diamond and percussion drilling. 
This work outlined significant base metal mineralisation 
hosted by chert, banded iron formations and carbonate-rich 
assemblages at Onedin, Sandiego, Hanging Tree and Gosford. 
Drilling immediately followed at these four prospects, with 29 
RC holes with diamond tails, with the most significant deposit 
defined from this work at Sandiego.
	
a
1978–1979: Newmont continued testing the known mineralisa-
tion, using extensive trenching, percussion and diamond drilling, 
detailed geophysics including ground magnetic surveys and 
low-level aeromagnetic surveys, which failed to locate significant 
extensions of the mineralisation in the known prospects.

identifying shallow resources at Sandiego and Onedin with 
percussion and diamond drilling programmes. Two polygonal 
Mineral Resources were estimated for Sandiego in 1996  
and 1997.
AAR was sole tenure holder of the properties between 
2002 and 2020. AAR drilled 245 RC and diamond drillholes 
encompassing 50,417 m, focusing on Mineral Resource, 
metallurgical and geotechnical drilling at the Sandiego and 
Onedin base metal deposits. Since 2011, AAR has focused 
on gold exploration, with little exploration for base metals 
occurring on the property. AAR reported Mineral Resources for 
Onedin in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
	
a
2021: AKN’s Joint Venture Agreement with AAR commenced 
in June 2021 and AKN assumed management and control 
of the exploration activities on the property with additional 
drilling completed in 2021 and 2022. AKN completed Mineral 
Resource estimates for the Sandiego and Onedin deposits in 
2022 and delivered a Scoping Study in 2023.
Geology
a	 Deposit type, geological setting, and 
style of mineralisation.
a	
Rocks of the Halls Creek Project are assigned to the Lamboo 
Province, of Palaeoproterozoic age (1910–1805 Ma), which 
formed within the northeast trending Halls Creek Orogen.
a	
The Central Zone of the Lamboo Province comprises turbiditic 
metasedimentary and mafic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of 
the Tickalara Metamorphics, deposited by 1865 Ma. These rocks 
were intruded by tonalitic sheets and deformed and metamor-
phosed between 1865–1856 Ma and 1850–1845 Ma.
a	
A younger succession of rocks comprising the sedimentary rocks 
and mafic and felsic volcanic rocks of the Koongie Park Formation 
(‘KPF’) were deposited in a possible rifted arc setting at around 
1843 Ma. Layered mafic-ultramafic bodies were intruded into the 
Central Zone at 1856 Ma, 1845 Ma and 1830 Ma. Large volumes 
of granite and gabbro of the Sally Downs Supersuite intruded the 
Central Zone during the Halls Creek Orogeny at 1835–1805 Ma. 
Researchers interpret the Central Zone to be an arc-like domain 
developed on a continental fragment.
a	
The KPF within the Project area is broadly characterised as a 
low metamorphic-grade sequence composed of mafic and felsic 
volcanics and associated sedimentary facies including sandstone, 
mudstone, carbonate, chert and ironstone intruded by rhyolitic to 
rhyodacitic sills, dolerite bodies and basalt dykes.

a	
The KPF hosts numerous base metal occurrences and two 
significant base metal deposits, Onedin and Sandiego.
a	
The upper unit of the KPF composes felsic volcanic units, 
carbonate, ironstone, chert, mudstone, quartz-bearing volcan-
iclastic beds and lithic sandstone. Currently known base metal 
prospects are concentrated in the upper KPF (i.e., the trend which 
includes Sandiego and Onedin deposits).
a	
Both, the Sandiego and Onedin deposits are situated within the 
limbs of intensely folded, higher order, double-plunging anticlinal 
structures that have been interpreted from magnetic images. 
The axial planes of the fold structures appear to be upright to 
south-southeast dipping. They trend northeast, sub-parallel to 
the regional transcurrent and anastomosing fault systems that 
dominate the Halls Creek Orogen
a	
The massive sulphide deposits of the Project have been 
traditionally classified as volcanogenic massive sulphide (‘VMS’) 
deposits. A PhD study concluded in 2002 proposed that the 
best model for the base metal occurrence is as a sub-horizontal 
basin floor replacement VMS. ERM concurs and considers the 
weight of evidence supports their interpretation as VMS deposits. 
Thus, the deposits are interpreted to have been formed around 
the time of deposition of the host volcanic and sedimentary 
strata in which they are bound and generally in bedding parallel 
lenses. Hydrothermal fluids associated with volcanic activity are 
interpreted to have been the source of the metals and other 
constituents of the mineralisation.
a	
Sphalerite is the main sulphide in the primary mineralisation at 
Onedin with subordinate pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-galena. 
Sphalerite chiefly occurs as fine-grained masses. In general, the 
sulphides exhibit replacement textures and show evidence of 
mobilisation, which is a result of deformation and metamorphism 
subsequent to initial formation.
a	
The mineralogy of the primary mineralisation at Sandiego is 
pyrite-sphalerite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite ± galena, which is largely 
hosted in the magnetite-rich exhalative suite of rocks where it 
occurs as a massive conformable wedge-shaped lens 200 m in 
length with a maximum thickness of 75 m. Weak to moderate 
sulphide vein and stringer mineralisation occur at the base of the 
exhalite package in the underlying tuffs. Mineralisation is relatively 
rare in the carbonate zone but may extend into the talc-chlorite 
schists. Overall, there is poor spatial correlation between copper 
and zinc mineralisation at Sandiego. However, discrete zinc-rich 
and copper-rich zones have been identified from core logging and 
assay results in the vertical dimension.
a	
The KPF exhibits a deep weathered profile at Sandiego and 
particularly Onedin, resulting in three weathering domains – 
oxidised zone at surface, primary zone at depth, and the transition 
zone in between. Each zone has very different mineral assem-
blages and consequently very different metallurgical properties.
a	
The oxidised zone consists of completely oxidised material, above 
the base of complete oxidation (‘BOCO’) surface. This surface 
is on average about 100 m below ground level. It is undulating 
and deepens significantly in the vicinity of steeply dipping faults. 
Gossans are developed at surface above the mineral deposits.
a	
The transition zone consists of partially oxidised material and 
is located between BOCO and the top of fresh rock (‘TOFR’). 
Supergene mineralisation is comprised of secondary mineralisa-
tion hosted in the oxidised and transition zones.

Data  
aggregation 
methods
a	 In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (e.g., cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated.
a	 Where aggregate intercepts 
incorporate short lengths of high- 
grade results and longer lengths of 
low-grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should be 
stated and some typical examples of 
such aggregations should be shown 
in detail.
a	 The assumptions used for any 
reporting of metal equivalent values 
should be clearly stated.
a	
Drill hole intercept grades are reported as downhole length-
weighted averages, ensuring each sample contributes 
proportionally to the final reported grade.
a	
Length-weighted averages were calculated using the standard 
industry formula:
Weighted Average Grade =  
(L1 × G1) + (L2 × G2) + (Ln × Gn) / L1 + L2 + Ln 
where L is the sample interval length and G is the corresponding 
grade. 
Example: For an interval comprising 4 metres at 2.0% Cu and  
6 metres at 3.0% Cu, the weighted average grade is:
(4 × 2.0) + (6 × 3.0) / 4 + 6 = 2.6% Cu
	
a
A nominal cut-off grade of 500 ppm Co was applied for 
reporting significant cobalt intercepts at the Sandiego 
deposit. Intervals meeting or exceeding this threshold were 
included in the reported aggregation. Internal dilution within 
aggregated intervals did not exceed 1 metre.
	
a
A nominal cut-off grade of 0.4% Cu was applied for reporting 
significant copper intercepts at the Onedin deposit. Due to the 
complex nature of mineralisation, where copper is interspersed 
with zinc, internal dilution was generally accepted. However, 
consecutive internal dilution within aggregated intercepts did 
not exceed 12 metres.
	
a
Within low-grade intervals reported at the 0.4% Cu cut-off, 
high-grade sub-intervals were identified using a 1.0% Cu 
cut-off. Internal dilution was assessed within the geological 
context of copper-zinc mineralisation, with consecutive internal 
dilution in high-grade sub-intervals limited to 2 metres.
	
a
Reported intercepts were aggregated using a hierarchical 
approach, first identifying broader mineralised intervals at 
the lower cut-off grade (e.g., 0.4% Cu), and then defining 
high-grade sub-intervals at the 1.0% Cu threshold.
	
a
This methodology ensures that significant high-grade 
zones are reported within broader mineralised envelopes, 
maintaining geological and economic relevance.
	
a
Internal dilution was minimised, and where included, was 
subject to constraints based on geological continuity and 
mineralisation style.
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths
a	 These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results.
a	 If the geometry of the mineralisation 
with respect to the drill hole angle is 
known, its nature should be reported.
a	 If it is not known and only the down 
hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this 
effect (e.g., ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’).
a	
The geometry of mineralisation with respect to the drill hole 
intersections reported from the Sandiego deposit is well estab-
lished and thus estimated true widths are provided, in addition to 
downhole lengths, in the table below.
a	
At the Onedin deposit, true widths of mineralisation through the 
oxide-transition zone are difficult to establish due to the extensive 
oxidation profile creating diffuse mineralisation patterns that 
complicate the interpretation of mineralisation geometry. Thus, 
only downhole lengths are reported.

Diagrams
a	 Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported These 
should include, but not be limited to a 
plan view of drill hole collar locations 
and appropriate sectional views.
a	
Appropriate maps and diagrams are presented in the body of this 
announcement.
Balanced 
reporting
a	 Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low 
and high grades and/or widths should 
be practiced to avoid misleading 
reporting of Exploration Results.
a	
Only mineralised drill hole intersections regarded as highly 
anomalous and of economic interest are reported. The proportion 
of each hole represented by the reported intervals can be ascer-
tained from the sum of the reported intervals divided by the total 
drill hole depth.
a	
All assay results for drill holes included in the Mineral Resources 
estimates have been considered and comprise results not 
necessarily regarded as anomalous. 
Other substan-
tive exploration 
data
a	 Other exploration data, if meaningful 
and material, should be reported 
including (but not limited to): 
geological observations; geophysical 
survey results; geochemical survey 
results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical 
test results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating 
substances.
a	
Density measurements were taken from 1,197 diamond core 
billets (Sandiego) and 459 billets (Onedin) over the life of the 
project. Samples were selected from every 1 m or 5 m downhole. 
Density measurements were carried out by field staff at the Halls 
Creek sample yard. During AAR’s ownership, core billets were 
initially wrapped in cling film, and density was determined using 
a conventional sample weight in air and then water. Samples 
with measured density values of >4.7 were discarded from the 
density database as these were considered too high for the style 
of mineralisation.
Further work
a	 The nature and scale of planned 
further work (e.g., tests for lateral 
extensions or depth extensions or 
large-scale step-out drilling).
a	 Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas 
of possible extensions, including 
the main geological interpretations 
and future drilling areas, provided 
this information is not commercially 
sensitive.
a	
 The Company intends to undertake a comprehensive audit of 
historical drilling, sampling, sub-sampling and analytical data to 
inform development of the forward work program for the Project. 
The nature and scale of planned further work will not be known 
until this audit has been completed.

Database 
integrity
a	 Measures taken to ensure that 
data has not been corrupted by, 
for example, transcription or keying 
errors, between its initial collection 
and its use for Mineral Resource 
estimation purposes.
a	 Data validation procedures used.
a	
Drill data is captured in a relational database prepared and 
maintained by Newexco, which contains relevant information 
for drill hole collars, drill samples, assays, down hole surveys 
and density data. Other information also provided relates to 
soil sampling, termite mound sampling, structural geology and 
magnetic susceptibility.
a	
All drilling data resides on Newexco’s NXDB database management 
system. Newexco is responsible for uploading all analytical and 
other drilling data and producing audited downloaded data for use in 
various mining software packages. The NXDB system has stringent 
data entry validation routines.
a	
Drill hole data tables were imported into Datamine software by CSA 
Global during the preparation of the Mineral Resource estimates. 
Minor issues were resolved by AuKing and Newxco prior to CSA 
Global progressing with the Mineral Resource estimates.
a	
The Competent Person considers the database integrity to be 
appropriate to support the reporting of a Mineral Resource.
Site Visits
a	 Comment on any site visits under-
taken by the Competent Person and 
the outcome of those visits.
a	 If no site visits have been undertaken 
indicate why this is the case.
a	
The Competent Person (Mineral Resources) has not visited the 
Halls Creek project. Travel restrictions imposed by the W.A. 
government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic prevented 
travel into the state at that time.
a	
Alternate personnel from CSA Global visited the site during 2006 
as part of managing the drilling programme. The CSA geologists 
carried out daily inspections of the drilling rig and associated 
sampling equipment, supervised the sampling programmes, 
geologically logged all RC hips and diamond core, including 
relogging of historical drill samples, and geologically mapped  
the project area.
a	
All work conducted was to industry standards and the Competent 
Person is satisfied all geological work carried out can be used to 
support the Mineral Resource.
Geological 
Interpretation
a	 Confidence in (or conversely, the 
uncertainty of ) the geological interpre-
tation of the mineral deposit.
a	 Nature of the data used and of any 
assumptions made.
a	 The effect, if any, of alternative 
interpretations on Mineral Resource 
estimation.
a	 The use of geology in guiding 
and controlling Mineral Resource 
estimation.
a	 The factors affecting continuity both of 
grade and geology.
a	
The Competent Person regards the geological understanding of 
the Onedin deposit to be of a high standard, with regards to the 
quantity and quality of drill sampling and geophysics supporting 
the geological interpretations.
a	
Surface geological mapping and geological logs of diamond drill 
core, and RC chips, along with sample assays were all used to 
assist with the geological interpretation.
a	
Alternative interpretations were not considered, with the interpreta-
tion used considered to best represent the geological knowledge 
of the deposit.
a	
The geological models control the interpolation of the grades into the 
resource model to prevent smearing of grades into the country rock.
a	
Mineralisation is hosted within both the weathered and fresh rock 
profiles, and the continuity is determined by the proto-mineralogy 
within the supergene profile, and lithology and structural controls 
within the primary rock profile.
a	
Supergene mineralisation at Onedin is well developed as the  
bulk of former primary mineralisation is located in the oxidised 
and transition zones. In particular, copper seems especially prone 
to supergene enrichment as reflected by the range of secondary 
copper minerals recorded at Onedin. Lead is also relatively 
enriched in gossans above the TOFR surface.
a	
The bulk of primary mineralisation is associated with the 
carbonate zone. There is also a strong structural control on 
mineralisation, and it appears to be concentrated in the core and 
limbs of the fold structure with some degree of remobilization.

Geological 
Interpretation 
(continued)
a	
The geological interpretation was guided firstly by geology, and 
secondly by grade envelopes to constrain mineralisation. Zinc 
domains were based upon a lower cut-off grade of 1.5 % Zn,  
and below the TOFR interface; copper domains were based upon 
a lower cut-off of 0.4 % Cu. Internal dilution was permitted during 
the interpretation of the mineralisation domains. Some overlap of 
the zinc and copper zones occurs.
Dimensions
a	 The extent and variability of the 
Mineral Resource expressed as 
length (along strike or otherwise), plan 
width, and depth below surface to the 
upper and lower limits of the Mineral 
Resource.
a	
The Onedin Mineral Resource extends along strike 300 m, across 
strike by 200 m and has a depth extent below surface of 400 m.
Estimation 
and Modelling 
Techniques
a	 The nature and appropriateness 
of the estimation technique(s) 
applied and key assumptions, 
including treatment of extreme grade 
values, domaining, interpolation 
parameters and maximum distance 
of extrapolation from data points. If a 
computer assisted estimation method 
was chosen include a description of 
computer software and parameters 
used.
a	 The availability of check estimates, 
previous estimates and/or mine 
production records and whether the 
Mineral Resource estimate takes 
appropriate account of such data.
a	 The assumptions made regarding 
recovery of by-products.
a	 Estimation of deleterious elements 
or other non-grade variables of 
economic significance (eg sulphur for 
acid mine drainage characterisation).
a	 In the case of block model interpo-
lation, the block size in relation to 
the average sample spacing and the 
search employed.
a	 Any assumptions behind modelling of 
selective mining units.
a	 Any assumptions about correlation 
between variables.
a	 Description of how the geological 
interpretation was used to control the 
resource estimates.
a	 Discussion of basis for using or not 
using grade cutting or capping.
a	 The process of validation, the 
checking process used, the 
comparison of model data to drill hole 
data, and use of reconciliation data if 
available.
a	
Datamine Studio was used for the geological modelling, 
block model construction, grade interpolation and validation. 
GeoAccess Professional and Snowden Supervisor software  
were used for geostatistical analyses.
a	
A block model with block sizes 5 m (X) x 10 m (Y) x 10 m (Z) 
was constructed. Sub-celling was used. The block sizes are 
approximately half the tightest drill spacing. Blocks were flagged 
according to the weathering and mineralisation envelopes.
a	
Drill sample data were flagged by the mineralisation and 
weathering domain envelopes, with variables MZONE and 
WEATH used. Drillholes were sampled at 1 m intervals and 
the drill samples were accordingly composited to 1 m lengths. 
Composited sample data were statistically reviewed to determine 
appropriate top-cuts, with top-cuts applied for Zn, Cu, Pb, 
Ag and Au where required. Log probability plots were used to 
determine the top-cuts, and the very high-grade samples were 
reviewed in Datamine by the Competent Person to determine if 
they were clustered with other high-grade samples. 
a	
Grades interpolated were Cu, Zn, Au, Ag, Co, Mo, Sb, As, S and Fe.
a	
Sample populations were split by the Cu and Zn mineralisation 
domains, as supported by a statistical analysis of assay data.
a	
The composited drill samples were input into variogram modelling. 
Downhole and directional variograms were modelled for Zn and 
Cu within the combined mineralisation domains and by weath-
ering profile. Moderate relative nugget effects were modelled, with 
short ranges approximately 50 m for Zn and Cu. 
a	
Grade interpolation used Inverse Distance squared (IDS) for the 
grade variables. All subblocks were assigned the grade of their 
parent block. Cell discretisation was used in each estimate. A 
sample search ellipse of 100 m by 100 m by 30 m (perpendicular to 
strike) was used, with a minimum of 8 samples and maximum of 24 
samples used to interpolate grade into any one block. A maximum 
of 4 samples per drill hole was used for grade interpolation. Search 
radii were increased, and the minimum number of minimum 
samples reduced in subsequent sample searches if cells were  
not interpolated in the first pass. Octant searches were not used.
a	
Grades were estimated into the waste domains using IDS.
a	
The Mineral Resource was an update of the 2008 Mineral 
Resource estimate, with additional drill holes incorporated.
a	
The interpolated grades were validated by way of review of  
cross sections (block model and drill samples presented with 
same colour legend); swath plots, and comparison of mean 
grades from drillhole data with block model grades.
a	
The Competent Person considers the procedures used to construct 
the block model and interpolate grades are appropriate for the style 
of mineralisation and reflect industry accepted practices.

Moisture
a	 Whether the tonnages are estimated 
on a dry basis or with natural mois-

of the moisture content.
a	
Tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.
Cut-off 
parameters
a	 The basis of the adopted cut-off 
grade(s) or quality parameters applied.
a	
The Onedin Mineral Resource is reported above a cut-off grade 
of 1 % Zn for the Zn and Mixed Zn-Cu zones, and above a cut-off 
of 0.4 % Cu for the Cu zone. The cut-off grades are considered 
suitable by the Competent Person for the method of mining 
considered to be appropriate for Onedin.
Mining factors 
or assump-
tions
a	 Assumptions made regarding 
possible mining methods, minimum 
mining dimensions and internal (or, if 
applicable, external) mining dilution. 
It is always necessary as part of the 
process of determining reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic 
extraction to consider potential 
mining methods, but the assumptions 
made regarding mining methods 
and parameters when estimating 
Mineral Resources may not always 
be rigorous. Where this is the case, 
this should be reported with an 
explanation of the basis of the mining 
assumptions made.
a	
Previous owners of the Project, Anglo Australian Resources (AAR) 
commissioned a preliminary mining assessment of the Sandiego 
and Onedin deposits. This study established 2 potential mining 
operations: Underground only at both Sandiego and Onedin; 
and an open pit operation at Onedin. No major mining problems 
were identified in this study, however, further work was subject to 
metallurgical recoveries.
a	
In 2008 internal mining study work by AAR focussed on 
underground mining of the sulphide and transition zones at 
Sandiego, with construction of a 500 tpa processing plant (using 
flotation technologies) with a 4–5-year operating life with Onedin 
development having the capacity to extend project life to 8 years 
mining Sandiego transition and sulphide ore. A conceptual study 
was also completed on open pit mining of Onedin based on 
conceptual metallurgical recoveries.
a	
No further mining studies for Onedin have been completed to date.
Metallurgical 
factors or 
assumptions
a	 The basis for assumptions or 
predictions regarding metallurgical 
amenability. It is always necessary as 
part of the process of determining 
reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction to consider 
potential metallurgical methods, 
but the assumptions regarding 
metallurgical treatment processes 
and parameters made when reporting 
Mineral Resources may not always be 
rigorous. Where this is the case, this 
should be reported with an explana-
tion of the basis of the metallurgical 
assumptions made.
a	
Significant metallurgical testwork has been undertaken on the 
Halls Creek deposits by various explorers since the 1970’s. Early 
work was effectively superseded by a major metallurgical testwork 
campaign undertaken by AAR from 2006. The metallurgical 
testwork established that saleable copper and zinc concentrates 
could be produced from the sulphide mineralisation at Sandiego 
and Onedin but work on the transitional material (using conven-
tional flotation techniques) was challenging. The 2007 testwork 
included 96 metallurgical sample tests on different ore types from 
Onedin and Sandiego to underpin a mineral processing flowsheet 
for economic study work.
a	
In 2009, AAR commissioned a review of the more than  
300 metallurgical tests that had then been completed over the 
various ore-types at Sandiego and Onedin, with a focus on the 
application of flotation recovery techniques. This study concluded: 
The metallurgy of the Sandiego transition and primary zones, 
whilst complex, is amenable to established flotation technology. 
The Onedin primary zone is amenable to the same flotation 
technology and can be processed through the same plant with 
minor modifications. The Onedin transition zone contains most of 
it’s value in the form of zinc oxide minerals and is not amenable to 
conventional flotation recovery but extraction by hydrometallurgy 
is possible. The Onedin oxide zone contains copper in the 
form of malachite which may be amenable to hydrometallurgy. 
Conventional flotation flowsheets were designed for processing 
the Onedin and Sandiego sulphide mineralisation. Project 
economics are very sensitive to metal recoveries and the grade of 
concentrate achieved. The O’Brien study recommended: Further 
testwork focussed on being as near to actual plant operating 
conditions as possible. Further testwork should encompass a 
continuous pilot scale test facility.
a	
AAR engaged several metallurgical/mineral processing specialists 
to review the possibilities of implementing novel treatment 
processes to treat the problematic transitional and oxide ores of 
Halls Creek during period 2009 to 2012. Meaningful trials recom-
mended were not implemented. No further metallurgical test work 
was undertaken since 2012, before the recent commencement 
by AKN of its initial metallurgical testwork program on the Onedin 
oxide and transitional ores.

Environmental 
factors or 
assumptions
a	 Assumptions made regarding possible 
waste and process residue disposal 
options. It is always necessary as 
part of the process of determining 
reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction to consider the 
potential environmental impacts of 
the mining and processing operation. 
While at this stage the determination 
of potential environmental impacts, 
particularly for a greenfields project, 
may not always be well advanced, 
the status of early consideration of 
these potential environmental impacts 
should be reported. Where these 
aspects have not been considered 
this should be reported with an 
explanation of the environmental 
assumptions made.
a	
The project is not located in an environmentally sensitive area. 
Several scoping studies have been undertaken, with no major 
environmental or other factors identified which would prevent the 
project from proceeding.
a	
It has been assumed that environmental factors can be effectively 
managed to allow the project to be bought into production.
a	
Anthropological, ethnographic surveys and environmental surveys 
have been undertaken prior to surface disturbance associated 
with exploration activities, with clearance being achieved over 
the majority of the deposit footprints. Identified sites have been 
placed in the public record.
Bulk Density
a	 Whether assumed or determined. If 
assumed, the basis for the assump-
tions. If determined, the method used, 
whether wet or dry, the frequency 
of the measurements, the nature, 
size and representativeness of the 
samples.
a	 The bulk density for bulk material must 
have been measured by methods 
that adequately account for void 
spaces (vugs, porosity, etc), moisture 
and differences between rock and 
alteration zones within the deposit.
a	 Discuss assumptions for bulk density 
estimates used in the evaluation 
process of the different materials.
a	
The method for density measurements is discussed in Section 2 
“Reporting of Exploration Results’.
a	
Diamond core billets from earlier drilling programmes were 
wrapped in cling film prior to immersion in water to prevent filling 
of cavities with water.
a	
A drill hole file was generated in Datamine capturing the density 
data, and this drill file was flagged by weathering and minerali-
sation domain in the same manner as the drill hole assays. The 
flagged density population was statistically analysed, with average 
density values determined for each mineralisation zone within 
each weathering zone. The following density values were applied 
per combination of domain:
a	
Oxide zone: Zn zone (Density = 2.31 t/m3); Cu zone (2.25); 
Overlap zone (2.73)
a	
Transitional zone: Zn zone (2.52); Cu zone (2.61); Overlap zone (2.82)
a	
Fresh zone: Zn zone (3.15); Cu zone (2.98); Overlap zone (3.05)
a	
The Competent Person considers the procedures used to 
measure sample bulk density, and the density values assigned 
to the Mineral Resource, are appropriate for the style of 
mineralisation.
Classification
a	 The basis for the classification of 
the Mineral Resources into varying 
confidence categories.
a	 Whether appropriate account has 
been taken of all relevant factors (ie 
relative confidence in tonnage/grade 
estimations, reliability of input data, 
confidence in continuity of geology 
and metal values, quality, quantity and 
distribution of the data).
a	 Whether the result appropriately 
reflects the Competent Person’s view 
of the deposit.
a	
The Mineral Resource has been classified following due consider-
ation of all criteria contained in Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3 
of JORC 2012 Table 1.
a	
The Mineral Resources were classified based upon drill hole 
spacing, quality of sampling and sample analyses, quantity of 
density measurements, and the relative confidence in the geological 
interpretation. This Mineral Resource is supported by a high level 
of confidence in the geological interpretations, sufficient to assume 
geological and grade continuity to satisfy an Indicated classification.
a	
All blocks within the Onedin Mineral Resource are classified as 
Indicated (RESCAT = 2).
a	
Waste blocks are recorded as unclassified (RESCAT=4).
a	
The final classification strategy and results appropriately reflect  
the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
Audits or 
Reviews
a	 The results of any audits or reviews of 
Mineral Resource estimates.
a	
The Mineral Resource estimate was internally peer reviewed by CSA 
Global. CSA Global reviewed the data collection, QAQC, geological 
modelling, statistical analyses, grade interpolation, density measure-
ments and resource classification strategies. The Competent Person 
relies upon the opinions of the peer reviewers when classifying the 
Mineral Resource, and is satisfied that the reviews were impartial 
and provided useful critique where necessary.
a	
No other audits or reviews are known to have occurred.

Discussion 
of relative 
accuracy / 
confidence
a	 Where appropriate a statement of the 
relative accuracy and confidence level 
in the Mineral Resource estimate using 
an approach or procedure deemed 
appropriate by the Competent Person. 
For example, the application of 
statistical or geostatistical procedures 
to quantify the relative accuracy of 
the resource within stated confidence 
limits, or, if such an approach is not 
deemed appropriate, a qualitative 
discussion of the factors that could 
affect the relative accuracy and 
confidence of the estimate.
a	 The statement should specify 
whether it relates to global or local 
estimates, and, if local, state the 
relevant tonnages, which should be 
relevant to technical and economic 
evaluation. Documentation should 
include assumptions made and the 
procedures used.
a	 These statements of relative accuracy 
and confidence of the estimate should 
be compared with production data, 
where available.
a	
Relevant tonnages and grade above nominated cut-off grades 
for Cu and Zn are provided in the CSA Global (now ERM) Mineral 
Resource report. Tonnages were calculated by filtering all blocks 
above the cut-off grade and sub-setting the resultant data into 
bins by mineralisation domain. The volumes of all the collated 
blocks were multiplied by the dry density value to derive the 
tonnages.
a	
The Mineral Resource is a local estimate, whereby the drill hole 
data was geologically domained above nominated cut-off grades.
a	
The Mineral Resource does not provide a calculated tonnage and 
grade, rather it provides the reader with estimated ‘median’ values 
about which can be inferred a range based upon the resource 
classification.

grades from drillhole data with block model grades.
a	
The Competent Person considers the procedures used to construct 
the block model and interpolate grades are appropriate for the style 
of mineralisation and reflect industry accepted practices.
Moisture
a	 Whether the tonnages are estimated 
on a dry basis or with natural mois-
ture, and the method of determination 
of the moisture content.
a	
Tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.
Cut-off 
parameters
a	 The basis of the adopted cut-off 
grade(s) or quality parameters applied.
a	
The Sandiego Mineral Resource is reported above a cut-off grade 
of 3 % Zn for the Zn and Mixed Zn-Cu zones, and above a cut-off 
of 0.8 % Cu for the Cu zone. The cut-off grades are considered 
suitable by the Competent Person for the method of mining 
considered to be appropriate for Sandiego.

Mining factors 
or assump-
tions
a	 Assumptions made regarding 
possible mining methods, minimum 
mining dimensions and internal (or, if 
applicable, external) mining dilution. 
It is always necessary as part of the 
process of determining reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic 
extraction to consider potential 
mining methods, but the assumptions 
made regarding mining methods 
and parameters when estimating 
Mineral Resources may not always 
be rigorous. Where this is the case, 
this should be reported with an 
explanation of the basis of the mining 
assumptions made.
a	
Previous owners of the Project, Anglo Australian Resources (AAR) 
commissioned a preliminary mining assessment of the Sandiego 
and Onedin deposits. This study established 2 potential mining 
operations: Underground only at both Sandiego and Onedin; 
and an open pit operation at Onedin. No major mining problems 
were identified in this study, however, further work was subject to 
metallurgical recoveries.
a	
In 2008 internal mining study work by AAR focussed on 
underground mining of the sulphide and transition zones at 
Sandiego, with construction of a 500tpa processing plant (using 
flotation technologies) with a 4–5-year operating life with Onedin 
development having the capacity to extend project life to 8 years 
mining Sandiego transition and sulphide ore. A conceptual study 
was also completed on open pit mining of Onedin based on 
conceptual metallurgical recoveries.
a	
In 2010 AAR commissioned a preliminary geotechnical model  
for Sandiego based on geotechnical diamond drilling results.  
The geotechnical assessment involved construction of a 3D 
Mining Rock Mass Model for the prospect and determination 
of preliminary geotechnical parameters for use in mine design 
studies. Raw data for the project comprised geotechnical and 
structural logging of 23 diamond holes. For the underground 
project, the rock mass has been classified into three geotechnical 
domains based on estimated Q’ values. Preliminary inter ramp 
slope angles (excluding ramps) for the prospect were developed 
for use is pit design studies.
a	
In 2011 AAR commissioned a scoping study on mining the 
Sandiego deposit. It concluded that: Exploitation of the Sandiego 
deposit by open pit and underground mining methods using an 
on-site concentrator and off-site smelting is potentially viable. 
Copper concentrates and zinc concentrated produced would be 
trucked to a suitable port facility such as Wyndham and stored 
until shipped to overseas smelters. A PFS level study  
was recommended.
a	
No further mining studies for Sandiego have been completed 
to date, however, AKN has identified the greater likelihood for 
mining is on the basis of an open pit operation at Onedin and 
an underground mine at Sandiego. For this reason, the different 
cut-off grades have been applied to the two deposits in the 
resource estimate.

Metallurgical 
factors or 
assumptions
a	 The basis for assumptions or 
predictions regarding metallurgical 
amenability. It is always necessary as 
part of the process of determining 
reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction to consider 
potential metallurgical methods, 
but the assumptions regarding 
metallurgical treatment processes 
and parameters made when reporting 
Mineral Resources may not always be 
rigorous. Where this is the case, this 
should be reported with an explana-
tion of the basis of the metallurgical 
assumptions made.
a	
Significant metallurgical testwork has been undertaken on the 
Halls Creek deposits by various explorers since the 1970s. Early 
work was effectively superseded by a major metallurgical testwork 
campaign undertaken by AAR from 2006. The metallurgical 
testwork established that saleable copper and zinc concentrates 
could be produced from the sulphide mineralisation at Sandiego 
and Onedin but work on the transitional material (using conven-
tional flotation techniques) was challenging. The 2007 testwork 
included 96 metallurgical sample tests on different ore types from 
Onedin and Sandiego to underpin a mineral processing flowsheet 
for economic study work. 
a	
In 2009, AAR commissioned a review of the more than  
300 metallurgical tests that had then been completed over the 
various ore-types at Sandiego and Onedin, with a focus on the 
application of flotation recovery techniques. This study concluded: 
The metallurgy of the Sandiego transition and primary zones, whilst 
complex, is amenable to established flotation technology. The 
Onedin primary zone is amenable to the same flotation technology 
and can be processed through the same plant with minor modifi-
cations. The Onedin transition zone contains most of it’s value in 
the form of zinc oxide minerals and is not amenable to conventional 
flotation recovery but extraction by hydrometallurgy is possible. 
The Onedin oxide zone contains copper in the form of malachite 
which may be amenable to hydrometallurgy. Conventional flotation 
flowsheets were designed for processing the Onedin and Sandiego 
sulphide mineralisation. Project economics are very sensitive to 
metal recoveries and the grade of concentrate achieved. The 
O’Brien study recommended: Further testwork focussed on being 
as near to actual plant operating conditions as possible. Further 
testwork should encompass a continuous pilot scale test facility. 
a	
AAR engaged several metallurgical/mineral processing specialists 
to review the possibilities of implementing novel treatment 
processes to treat the problematic transitional and oxide ores of 
Halls Creek during period 2009 to 2012. Meaningful trials recom-
mended were not implemented. No further metallurgical test work 
was undertaken since 2012, before the recent commencement 
by AKN of its initial metallurgical testwork program on the Onedin 
oxide and transitional ores.
Environmental 
factors or 
assumptions
a	 Assumptions made regarding possible 
waste and process residue disposal 
options. It is always necessary as 
part of the process of determining 
reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction to consider the 
potential environmental impacts of 
the mining and processing operation. 
While at this stage the determination 
of potential environmental impacts, 
particularly for a greenfields project, 
may not always be well advanced, 
the status of early consideration of 
these potential environmental impacts 
should be reported. Where these 
aspects have not been considered 
this should be reported with an 
explanation of the environmental 
assumptions made.
a	
The project is not located in an environmentally sensitive area. 
Several scoping studies have been undertaken, with no major 
environmental or other factors identified which would prevent  
the project from proceeding.
a	
It has been assumed that environmental factors can be effectively 
managed to allow the project to be bought into production.
a	
Anthropological, ethnographic surveys and environmental surveys 
have been undertaken prior to surface disturbance associated 
with exploration activities, with clearance being achieved over 
the majority of the deposit footprints. Identified sites have been 
placed in the public record.

Bulk Density
a	 Whether assumed or determined. If 
assumed, the basis for the assump-
tions. If determined, the method used, 
whether wet or dry, the frequency 
of the measurements, the nature, 
size and representativeness of the 
samples.
a	 The bulk density for bulk material must 
have been measured by methods 
that adequately account for void 
spaces (vugs, porosity, etc), moisture 
and differences between rock and 
alteration zones within the deposit.
a	 Discuss assumptions for bulk density 
estimates used in the evaluation 
process of the different materials.
a	
The method for density measurements is discussed in Section 2 
“Reporting of Exploration Results’.
a	
Diamond core billets from earlier drilling programmes were 
wrapped in cling film prior to immersion in water to prevent filling 
of cavities with water.
a	
A drill hole file was generated in Datamine capturing the density 
data, and this drill file was flagged by weathering and minerali-
sation domain in the same manner as the drill hole assays. The 
flagged density population was statistically analysed, with average 
density values determined for each mineralisation zone within 
each weathering zone. The following density values were applied 
per combination of domain:
a	
Oxide zone: Zn zone (Density = 3.1 t/m3); Cu zone (3.1); Overlap 
zone (3.1).
a	
Transitional zone: Zn zone (3.18); Cu zone (3.22); Overlap zone 
(3.24).
a	
Fresh zone: Zn zone (3.33); Cu zone (3.24); Overlap zone (3.34).
a	
The Competent Person considers the procedures used to 
measure sample bulk density, and the density values assigned 
to the Mineral Resource, are appropriate for the style of 
mineralisation.
Classification
a	 The basis for the classification of 
the Mineral Resources into varying 
confidence categories.
a	 Whether appropriate account has 
been taken of all relevant factors (ie 
relative confidence in tonnage/grade 
estimations, reliability of input data, 
confidence in continuity of geology 
and metal values, quality, quantity and 
distribution of the data).
a	 Whether the result appropriately 
reflects the Competent Person’s view 
of the deposit.
a	
The Mineral Resource has been classified following due consider-
ation of all criteria contained in Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3 
of JORC 2012 Table 1.
a	
The Mineral Resources were classified based upon drill hole 
spacing, quality of sampling and sample analyses, quantity of 
density measurements, and the relative confidence in the geological 
interpretation. This Mineral Resource is supported by a high level 
of confidence in the geological interpretations, sufficient to assume 
geological and grade continuity to satisfy an Indicated classification.
a	
All blocks within the Sandiego Mineral Resource are classified 
as a combination of Indicated (RESCAT = 2) and Inferred 
(RESCAT=3).
a	
Polygons were digitised in the longitudinal section of the mineral-
isation to define the classification envelopes, and a cookie cutter 
approach was used to stamp the classification schema onto the 
block model.
a	
Waste blocks are recorded as unclassified (RESCAT=4).
a	
The final classification strategy and results appropriately reflect the 
Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
Audits or 
Reviews
a	 The results of any audits or reviews of 
Mineral Resource estimates.
a	
The Mineral Resource estimate was internally peer reviewed by CSA 
Global. CSA Global reviewed the data collection, QAQC, geological 
modelling, statistical analyses, grade interpolation, density measure-
ments and resource classification strategies. The Competent Person 
relies upon the opinions of the peer reviewers when classifying the 
Mineral Resource, and is satisfied that the reviews were impartial 
and provided useful critique where necessary.
a	
No other audits or reviews are known to have occurred.

Discussion 
of relative 
accuracy / 
confidence
a	 Where appropriate a statement of 
the relative accuracy and confidence 
level in the Mineral Resource 
estimate using an approach or 
procedure deemed appropriate by 
the Competent Person. For example, 
the application of statistical or 
geostatistical procedures to quantify 
the relative accuracy of the resource 
within stated confidence limits, or, 
if such an approach is not deemed 
appropriate, a qualitative discussion 
of the factors that could affect the 
relative accuracy and confidence of 
the estimate.
a	 The statement should specify 
whether it relates to global or local 
estimates, and, if local, state the 
relevant tonnages, which should be 
relevant to technical and economic 
evaluation. Documentation should 
include assumptions made and the 
procedures used.
a	 These statements of relative accuracy 
and confidence of the estimate should 
be compared with production data, 
where available.
a	
Relevant tonnages and grade above nominated cut-off grades 
for Cu and Zn are provided in the CSA Global (now ERM) Mineral 
Resource report. Tonnages were calculated by filtering all blocks 
above the cut-off grade and sub-setting the resultant data into 
bins by mineralisation domain. The volumes of all the collated 
blocks were multiplied by the dry density value to derive the 
tonnages.
a	
The Mineral Resource is a local estimate, whereby the drill hole 
data was geologically domained above nominated cut-off grades.
a	
The Mineral Resource does not provide a calculated tonnage and 
grade, rather it provides the reader with estimated ‘median’ values 
about which can be inferred a range based upon the resource 
classification.
