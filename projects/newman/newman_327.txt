Peregrine Gold Limited (“Peregrine” or the “Company”) (ASX: PGD) is pleased to announce 
it has executed an agreement, via its wholly owned subsidiary Pilbara Gold Exploration Pty

Subject to the grant of the SPL, the Agreement stipulates the exploitation of precious metals 
can proceed under the following conditions: 
• 
Any expenditures incurred in the process of exploitation are to funded by Mark Creasy 
and will be deducted from the value of any gold recovered (Net Value); 
• 
The Net Value of any gold recovered (cash or physical form) to be divided 60/40 in 
favour of Peregrine; 
• 
The SPL cannot be converted to a mining license and may not be advanced beyond 
50m vertical depth from surface; 
• 
Commencing from execution, the Agreement has a maximum term of three years and 
nine months; 
• 
While Mr Creasy is responsible for and managing the SPL, as part of the Agreement, 
all activities are to be coordinated with Peregrine so that any significant mineralisation 
identified will be reported to the market in accordance with the Company’s continuous 
disclosure policy. 
Having had a history of demonstrating spectacular shallow gold intercepts (Figures 3-6) (Table 
1) (ASX Announcement: 5 August 2022), the Agreement recognises the significant potential 
of the Peninsula prospect and due to the Agreement being free carried through to gold

monetisation, potentially provides the Company a pathway to generating cashflow at a time 
when the Australian gold price continues to reach all-time highs. 
Technical Director of Peregrine Mr. George Merhi commented: 
“It’s a pleasure to partner with a supportive shareholder with arguably the best track record for 
discovery and value creation in Australia on an initiative that will greatly advance our 
understanding of the geological potential of the Peninsula prospect. We look forward to 
updating shareholders once the SPL is granted.”

that potential identification of gold and visuals of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or 
substitute for laboratory analysis where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal economic interest. Visual 
estimates also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or deleterious physical properties relevant to 
valuations.
