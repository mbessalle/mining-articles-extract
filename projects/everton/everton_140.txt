surface open-cut and shallow underground mining between 1917 and 1944, and produced
approximately 306 tons of molybdenum concentrate averaging around 85% molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) from two steeply plunging circular “pipe-like” ore bodies.
Production was limited to a maximum depth of forty-five metres. The Number One pipe reportedly
produced 295 tons of flotation concentrate from 17,214 tons of treated ore between 1917 and All Projects
1941, while the later mined Number Two pipe produced 11 tons of concentrate from 2,700 tons of
treated ore between 1942 and 1943, making the Everton mining operation the largest in the
province of Victoria (Jeffriess, D., 2009).

New Rare Earth Elements (REE) Tenement Granted
Molybdenum is essential for modern technologies, economies and national security. It’s used in steel
alloys to improve strength, resistance to corrosion and heat, and to reduce brittleness.
The Molybdenum Market Size was estimated at USD 18.86 billion in 2024. The Molybdenum
Industry is expected to grow from USD 19.62 billion in 2025 to USD 27.98 billion by 2034 with a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) forecasted at around 4% between 2025 and 2034.
(Source:https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/molybdenum-market-26146)
The key market drivers are the demand from the steel industry; growing adoption of chemical and
electrical industries; and expansion of aerospace and defense applications. Molybdenum is also an
essential component of radiation shielding materials used in space travel including by Space
Exploration Technologies Corp (“SpaceX”).
Aidan Bishop, Director, commented:
“The Everton Project in Victoria is a strategic addition to our portfolio in Australia and builds upon our
stake in Eversley Resources Pty Ltd, a large land package in South Australia with highly prospective
geology for iron oxide copper and gold (IOCG) that sits within a great geological address.”
“Historical mining at Everton produced high grade molybdenum and we intend to formulate a work
program that seeks to establish if grade continues both below the old mined areas and across the
geological structures of the tenement. I look forward to updating shareholders further with our
plans in the near future.”
