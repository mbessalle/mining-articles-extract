GREENVALE ACQUIRES 100% INTEREST IN ADVANCED
HIGH GRADE OASIS URANIUM PROJECT, LOCATED 50KM
WEST OF GREENVALE FNQ
Oasis was discovered during the 1970s uranium exploration push by International
companies , most notably Esso whose subsequent work (1977-1979) defined high
priority targets with only the Oasis deposit drill tested to date
Oasis occurs along a structure associated with a major crustal terrane boundary.
(Lynd Mylonite Zone). The metamorphic host rocks, voluminous granite and
leucogranite and deformation history share many of the characteristics that can be
interpreted as Intrusive (Alaskite) style of uranium mineralisation . This is an exciting
possibility, if further exploration continues to strengthen the analogy with world class
uranium mines like the Rossing, Namibia.
Highlights:
• Greenvale acquires 100% interest in EPM 27565, covering 90 km2 of fault bound
alkaline intrusive and metamorphic terrane which includes the high grade Oasis
uranium deposit and 8 additional high priority uranium targets
• Airborne radiometric uranium anomalies were located by Anglo American in
1973, Esso completed major on ground work 1977-1979 1nd drilled 46 holes (32
diamond, 14 percussion) for a total of 4755 m. Esso defined high grade primary
uranium mineralisation over a 300m strike length and 200m vertical depth.
Mineralisation remains open at depth and possibly along strike.
• Four due diligence diamond drill holes completed in 2006 by Glengarry
Resources validated the historic Esso data and confirmed continuous high
grade mineralisation with intercepts up to 1m @ 0.72% U3O8 (15.8 lbs/t).
• Oasis shear is interpreted to extend undercover for another 1.5Km to the north
and remains untested for extensions to mineralisation.
• Historical radiometric and magnetic data identified large zones of structurally
controlled anomalism which remain untested by drilling
• Most recently Terra Search Pty Ltd reprocessed and interpreted the historic
geophysical data identifying 9 priority Uranium anomalies over a 10km strike
length adjacent to ,, and apparently emanating from the major terrane
boundary delineated as the Lynd Mylonite Zone.
• Geoscience Australia (GA) have age dated Oasis Uraninite and associated
alteration sericite which has determined a mineralisation age of 433 +/-4 Ma.
This Silurian date coincides the uranium mineralisation with the major period of
felsic plutonism present across the region. It also strengthens the association

of the intrusive bodies of the age in the area which are the likely drivers of the
U mineralization. The recording of alaskite intrusives of similar age , along with
other features such as the mineralisation occurring in shear hosted structural
niches within tightly folded high grade metamorphism associated with chlorite-
biotite alteration, again strengthens the intrusive related ”Alaskite
mineralization style” analogy.
• This latter point could be highly significant as Alaskites account for around 10%
of global Uranium reserves and are generally large, moderate grade deposits,
the most striking example being Rossing, Namibia.
Greenvale Energy Ltd (ASX: GRV, “Greenvale” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise it
has acquired a 100% interest in the advanced high grade Oasis Uranium project. The Oasis
deposit and associated regional uranium anomalism are contained with EPM 27565 which
cover 53 subblocks over an area of 90 km2 and located 250 km west of Townsville and 50
km west of Greenvale in FNQ (Figure 1). The project area is located entirely within the Lynd
Station pastoral land. The company has acquired the 100% interest from the vendors
Maverick Exploration Pty Ltd, Remlain Pty Ltd and Mineral Intelligence Pty Ltd (equal 1/3
each interest) for a consideration of $200,000 cash and the issue of 20 million Greenvale
shares.

The acquisition of Oasis adds considerable weight to Greenvale’s portfolio of Uranium
exploration projects and is expected to be rapidly upgraded to resource status during the
2025 exploration season.
Project Geology and Mineralisation
Geology within EPM 27565 is dominated by structurally complex mixture of intrusive
granitic and metamorphic rocks of Proterozoic, , Ordovician and Silurian Age with recent
age dating of uraninite from the Oasis deposit recording a Silurian age. The Lynd Mylonite
Zone is a dominant structural feature which strikes north north-east through the centre of
the exploration permit. Multiple faults and fractures splaying off the western side of the
mylonite appear to control the distribution of extensive zones of uranium anomalism
including the Oasis deposit. The granitic-metamorphic terrane hosting the uranium
mineralisation is bounded 10km’s to the east by the Far East Mylonite Zone which strikes
parallel to the Lynd Mylonite Zone

Previous Exploration
Uranium potential was first identified by Aust Anglo American in 1973-74 from airborne
radiometrics followed up by ground radiometrics, mapping and trenching. Three clusters
of anomalies were identified on the western side of the Lynd Mylonite Zone including the
Oasis anomaly. From 1977-1979 Esso Minerals conducted ground radiometrics, mapping
and auger drilling prior to completing 34 diamond drill holes and 14 percussion holes at
the Oasis prospect. Esso drilling defined a continuous zone of high grade mineralisation
of varying thickness over a 300m strike length and 200m vertical depth (Table 1). The
mineralisation remained open along strike and at depth. No further work was undertaken
at oasis or other prospects.

From 2007-2010 Mega Georgetown (MG), a Canadian Company, drilled 10 RC holes at
Oasis for a total of 1710m. The drilling was designed to test for continuity of mineralisation
outside of the Esso drilling envelope and confirmed extensions of mineralisation to the
north and at depth (Figure 3) (Table 3). All holes intersected uranium mineralisation
although of lower tenor than Esso diamond drilling. MG also completed a detailed 50-
100m line spaced aeromagnetic survey identifying numerous structural zones coincident
with radiometric anomalism.

Figure 3. Mega Georgetown RC drill plan
From 2021, Maverick Exploration in conjunction with Townsville based mineral consultants
Terra Search Pty Ltd have undertaken a major historic data compilation and data capture
exercise. As part of this work Principal Geologist Dr Simon Beams completed a detailed
study of the Glengarry (most recent) drill core from Oasis. While Geophysicist Tim Beams
carried out a major reprocessing and interpretation of the Mega Georgetown airborne and
ground magnetic and radiometric surveys resulting in high resolution images providing
significant insights into the geology and structural controls of the Project (Figure 4).

Oasis Deposit
Figure 4. Uranium radiometrics EPM 27565
The recent work by Terra Search has demonstrated the potential of EPM 27565 to host
multiple structurally controlled uranium deposits as exemplified by Oasis. Nine priority
targets have been identified by Terra Search based on elevated radiometrics coincident
with structural corridors (Figure 5). Note Target A is a discrete, intense U anomaly which
encompasses the Oasis uranium deposit.
GRE E NVA LE E NE RGY LI M ITE D 9

Figure 5. Potential Uranium Targets EPM 27565
Terra Search also noted comparisons between Oasis and Intrusive Type Uranium
deposits. Recent age dating of Oasis uraninite confirms mineralisation occurred in the Mid
Silurian in conjunction with leucogranite emplacement in the region. Mineralisation at
Oasis is hosted by a quartz chlorite biotite schistose shear zones, with country rocks
dominated by metamorphic host rocks, calc silicates and voluminous granite/
leucogranite. It was noted that these host rocks and deformation history share many of
the characteristics that can be interpreted as Intrusive (Alaskite) style of uranium
mineralisation . Further exploration is planned to strengthen this analogy as world class
uranium mines like Rossing ,,Namibia are of the Intrusive (Alaskite) type which are

generally large moderate grade deposits hosting approximately 10% of global uranium
reserves.
Proposed Exploration program
Greenvale proposes an aggressive 2025 exploration program at Oasis with the goal of
bringing known and extended mineralisation at Oasis to JORC 2012 resource status. This
is to be done in three stages:
1. Geochemical testing of entire Oasis shear which extends under cover for 1.5kms
north of identified mineralisation by track etch technique (radon gas cupping,
emanometry) (Figure 7) and geological prospecting.
2. Geochemical testing of 8 priority coincident radiometric/structural anomalies by
track etch technique in conjunction with geological prospecting and follow up
drilling of identified targets.
3. Ground truthing and detailed mapping of all undercover structural splays
emanating from the Lynd Mylonite zone where radiometrics don’t work and
geochemical testing of identified splays with track etch technique.
