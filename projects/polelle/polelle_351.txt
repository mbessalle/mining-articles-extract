POLELLE AND WANGANUI PROJECTS
PURCHASE AND JOINT VENTURE
OPTION AGREEMENT REVISED
HIGHLIGHTS
➢ GBR has renegotiated the Heads of Agreement with Castle Minerals Ltd to acquire a 75%
interest in and jointly explore the Polelle and Wanganui Projects near Meekatharra
➢ This allows an additional 12 months to test both areas prior to making a decision to
acquire a Joint Venture interest
➢ Castle has waived the $100,000 Option Extension Fee and GBR has committed to a
minimum cumulative exploration expenditure of $600,000 on the two projects during the
full two-year term of the option
Great Boulder Resources (“Great Boulder” or the “Company”) (ASX: GBR) is pleased to provide
an update on the Polelle and Wanganui Projects near Meekatharra in Western Australia. Both
projects are located close to the Company’s Side Well Gold Project (“Side Well”) which hosts a
Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) of 668,000oz @ 2.8 g/t Au.
On 30 November 2023 GBR announced the signing a Heads of Agreement with Castle Minerals Ltd
(“Castle”) over the Polelle and Wanganui areas, giving the Company 12 months within which to
conduct initial exploration and decide whether to acquire a joint venture interest. The initial
agreement allowed for a 12-month extension to the option period if required.
Exploration during 2024 was hampered by delays in completing heritage surveys to clear priority
targets for initial drill testing. Castle has therefore agreed to GBR’s request to extend the option
period for an additional 12 months to 30 November 2025 and to waive the second option fee of
$100,000. GBR has committed to a minimum cumulative exploration expenditure of $600,000 on the
two projects during the full two-year term of the option.
All other material terms, including the Option Exercise Fee of $100,000 payable in GBR shares,
remain the same.
Next Steps
Initial exploration by GBR including regional mapping and assessment of previous auger sampling
generated several priority targets at Polelle. Limited AC drilling was undertaken during 2024,
however access was restricted due to a lack of previous heritage clearances. The Company has
now requested heritage surveys which will allow these areas to be drill tested shortly.

Appendix 1 - JORC Code, 2012 Edition Table 1 (GBR Drilling, Side Well Project)
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria Commentary
Sampling techniques At the Side Well Project GBR has collected data from auger sampling and from AC, RC and Diamond
drilling techniques. This section encompasses all four methods.
RC samples were collected into calico bags over 1m intervals using a cyclone splitter. The residual
bulk samples are placed in lines of piles on the ground. 2 cone splits are taken off the rig splitter for
RC drilling. Visually prospective zones were sampled over 1m intervals and sent for analysis while the
rest of the hole was composited over 4m intervals by taking a scoop sample from each 1m bag.
Core samples are selected visually based on observations of alteration and mineralisation and
sampled to contacts or metre intervals as appropriate. Once samples are marked the core is cut in
half longitudinally with one half taken for assay and the other half returned to the core tray.
AC samples were placed in piles on the ground with 4m composite samples taken using a scoop.
Auger samples are recovered from the auger at blade refusal depth. Auger drilling is an open-hole
technique.
Drilling techniques Industry standard drilling methods and equipment were utilised.
Auger drilling was completed using a petrol-powered hand-held auger.
Drill sample recovery Sample recovery data is noted in geological comments as part of the logging process. Sample
condition has been logged for every geological interval as part of the logging process. Water was
encountered during drilling resulting in minor wet and moist samples with the majority being dry.
No quantitative twinned drilling analysis has been undertaken.
Logging Geological logging of drilling followed established company procedures. Qualitative logging of
samples includes lithology, mineralogy, alteration, veining and weathering. Abundant geological
comments supplement logged intervals.
Sub-sampling techniques 1m cyclone splits and 4m speared composite samples were taken in the field. Samples were
and sample preparation prepared and analysed at ALS Laboratories Perth for the RC drilling and Intertek Laboratories for
the AC drilling. Samples were pulverized so that each samples had a nominal 85% passing 75
microns. Au analysis was undertaken using Au-AA26 involving a 50g lead collection fire assay and
Atomic Adsorption Spectrometry (AAS) finish. For AC drilling, Au analysis was undertaken at
Intertek using a 50g lead collection fire assay with ICP-OES finish (FA50/OE).
Multi-element analysis was completed at both ALS and Intertek Laboratories. Digestion was
completed using both 4 Acid and Aqua-regia and analysed by ICP-AES and ICP-MS (Intertek code
4A/MS48, ALS codes ME-MS61, ME-ICP41-ABC).
Quality of assay data All samples were assayed by industry standard techniques. Fire assay for gold; four-acid digest and
and laboratory tests aqua regia for multi-element analysis.
Verification of sampling The standard GBR protocol was followed for insertion of standards and blanks with a blank and
and assaying standard inserted per 25 for RC drilling and 40 samples for AC drilling. Field Duplicates as second
cone splits are inserted within known ore zones to assess repeatability. Analysis of ME was typically
done on master pulps after standard gold analysis with a company multi-element standard inserted
every 50 samples. No QAQC problems were identified in the results. No twinned drilling has been
undertaken.
Location of data points Sample locations and mapping observations were located and recorded electronically using a
handheld GPS. Coordinates were recorded in GDA94 grid in Zone 50, which is the GDA94 zone for
the Meekatharra area.
Drill holes were positioned using the same technique. Hole collars were initially picked up after
drilling using a handheld GPS. RC and Diamond hole collars were subsequently surveyed with a DGPS
for greater accuracy.
This accuracy is sufficient for the intended purpose of the data.

(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section.)
Criteria Commentary
Mineral tenement and Side Well tenement E51/1905 is a 48-block exploration license covering an area of 131.8km2
land tenure status immediately east and northeast of Meekatharra in the Murchison province. The tenement is a 75:25
joint venture between Great Boulder and Zebina Minerals Pty Ltd.
Aircore drilling was completed on P51/3178 and P51/2978 located directly south of E51/1905. These
tenements are held in a 80:20 joint venture between Great Boulder and Wanbanna Pty Ltd.
Exploration done by Tenement E51/1905, P51/3178 and P51/2978 have protracted exploration histories but are relatively
other parties unexplored compared to other regions surrounding Meekatharra.
Geology The Side Well tenement group covers a portion of the Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone Belt north
of Meekatharra, WA. The north-northeasterly-trending Archaean Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone
Belt, comprises a succession of metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic and felsic and sedimentary rocks
belonging to the Luke Creek and Mount Farmer Groups.
Over the northern extensions of the belt, sediments belonging to the Proterozoic Yerrida Basin
unconformably overlie Archaean granite-greenstone terrain. Structurally, the belt takes the form of
a syncline known as the Polelle syncline. Younger Archaean granitoids have intrusive contacts with
the greenstone succession and have intersected several zones particularly in the Side Well area.
Within the Side Well tenement group, a largely concealed portion of the north-north-easterly
trending Greenstone Belt is defined, on the basis of drilling and airborne magnetic data, to underlie
the area. The greenstone succession is interpreted to be tightly folded into a south plunging syncline
and is cut by easterly trending Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
There is little to no rock exposure at the Side Well prospect. This area is covered by alluvium and
lacustrine clays, commonly up to 60 metres thick. Subcrop exposures of laterite, mafic and ultramafic
rocks are present along the eastern side of the project, however exposure of outcrop is still relatively
poor.
Drill hole Information A list of the drill hole coordinates, orientations and intersections reported in this announcement are
provided as an appended table in the relevant announcements for each drilling program.
Data aggregation Results were reported using cut-off levels relevant to the sample type. For composited samples
methods significant intercepts were reported for grades greater than 0.1g/t Au with a maximum dilution of
4m. For single metre splits, significant intercepts were reported for grades greater than 0.5g/t Au
with a maximum dilution of 3m.
A weighted average calculation may be used to allow for bottom of hole composites that were less
than the standard 4m and when intervals contain composited samples plus 1m split samples.
No metal equivalents are used.
