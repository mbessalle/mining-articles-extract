Melbourne, Australia — September 9th, 2024 
Kincora Copper Limited (TSXV & ASX: KCC, Kincora or the Company) is pleased have been 
awarded the Nyngan West, Nyngan South and Nevertire South projects located within the 
northern under cover extensions of the Macquarie Arc, in central west NSW, Australia.  
Sam Spring, President and CEO of Kincora commented:  
 “Kincora’s strategy to create shareholder value is through obtaining the best ground, 
concluding commercial deals and making large scale copper-gold discoveries. Recently we 
have attracted four industry partners and unlocked up to A$60m of multi-year funding. 
We are very pleased to have opportunistically secured three bolt-on new projects covering 
1,377km2 with clear scale potential and strategic value, now providing Kincora a 
continuous north-south strike extent of over 100km in the NJNB. 
This new ground is adjacent to and on the interpreted extensions of the Nyngan and 
Nevertire projects where maiden partner funded ground geophysical surveys are already 
ongoing with Fleet Space, and maiden drilling activities are shortly ramping up in 
partnership with and funded by AngloGold Ashanti at Nyngan. 
The Company and our existing partners are very excited to commence the first ever 
copper-gold exploration across potentially the largest volcano-intrusive complex of the 
Macquarie Arc at northern Nyngan, which offers new district scale potential.

Kincora continues to build and advance our project pipeline, exploring further 
partnerships. In particular, securing the advanced and highly prospective Nevertire South 
ground in our view significantly enhances our Nevertire project and NJNB portfolio.” 
 
New wholly owned projects  
Pegged as open ground, Kincora has been awarded new exploration licenses covering a total of 
1,377km2 (100% ownership) including the Nyngan West, Nyngan South and Nevertire South 
projects – see Figures 1 to 3.  
The new licenses are opportunistic new bolt-on projects with clear scale and value path, 
doubling Kincora’s land position in the NBJB. The NBJB is one of the two major volcanic belts 
of the Macquarie Arc, where regional magnetics has proven to be effective in mapping the key 
belts and major intrusive complexes.  
The new licenses provide Kincora a continuous north-south strike extent of over 100km in the 
interpreted shallow to moderate depth sections of the under cover extension of the Macquarie 
Arc. The new licenses also consolidate the extensions of intrusive complex targets included in 
the existing earn-in partnership with AngloGold Ashanti. 
Regional geophysics strongly indicates that Kincora’s Nyngan license has the potential to host 
the largest volcano-intrusive complex of the Macquarie Arc, which is currently almost untested 
with drilling to commence within the month in partnership with AngloGold Ashanti.  
Kincora’s portfolio and the wider NJNB offers new district-scale discovery potential with spatial 
and temporal settings, coupled with magnetics, gravity and new ANT surveys, supportive of 
large-scale targets analogous to porphyry deposits located in the southern section of the 
Macquarie Arc which host an existing >160Moz gold equivalent endowment (see Figure 2) 1.  
To help emphasis the true new district scale potential of the Company’s NJNB portfolio, the 
total AngloGold Ashanti earn-in and Kincora wholly owned project portfolio now covers a strike 
length that is twice that of the rapidly emerging Vicuña porphyry district (see Figure 2).  
Within the Vicuña district, NGEx Resources Inc in 2009 held three early-stage exploration 
projects that, at the time, supported a market capitalisation of approximately C$40 million 2. 
These same projects are all still at a pre-development phase but have yielded four large-scale 
discoveries currently valued at over C$8.5 billion after the corporate transactions involving 
BHP and Lundin Mining last month 2, 3. 
Of particular note, the new Nevertire South project (962km2) is considered highly prospective 
and consolidates the ~8 x 12km Nevertire Magmatic Complex, the northern third held in 
Kincora’s existing partnership with AngloGold Ashanti (see the insert in Figure 2).  
Prior explorer drilling at the southern section of the Nevertire Magmatic Complex (within the 
Nevertire South project) has returned anomalous copper-gold mineralisation, favourable 
fertility defined by green rock analysis, geochemical zonation and alteration suggestive of an 
outer porphyry system setting with age dates confirming a highly prospective Phase 4 
Macquarie Arc intrusive complex (at approximately 220m depth down hole). This supports 
Nevertire South being the most advanced porphyry project within the NJNB district (see Figure

4), situated under potentially only 100 metres of cover and enhancing the value of the adjacent 
Nevertire project. 
Kincora has recently secured three prior exploration drill holes from the Nevertire South 
project with relogging planned as discussions with potential technical and funding partners 
progress. 
About the NJNB Project Portfolio 
The Macquarie Arc is Australia’s premier porphyry copper-gold province and the undercover 
extensions of the Arc are a globally significant exploration opportunity offering new district(s) 
scale discovery potential. The region has recently attracted five major earn-in/option and joint 
venture agreements supporting potentially over $300 million in exploration and development 
expenditure, including the recent option and joint venture agreements between Gold Fields and 
privately owned Gold & Copper Resources 4. 
The most recent notable example of a new emerging globally significant porphyry district is the 
Vicuña district in the central Andes in Argentina on the border of Chile, which is largely 
consolidated by Lundin group entities and BHP and situated at over 4000m altitude. Within 
this district NGEx Resources Inc in 2009 held three early stage exploration projects and at the 
time had a market capitalisation of approximately C$40 million. These same projects are all 
still at a pre-development phase but have yielded in four large-scale discoveries currently 
valued at over C$8.5 billion (see Figure 2). 
Regional geophysics strongly indicates that the largest sections of the Macquarie Arc still 
remain untested under post mineral cover within the NJNB. Kincora was the early entrant 
securing a district scale position in the interpreted shallow to moderate covered core sections of 
this region by pegging Nyngan and Nevertire (covering now 939 km2). 
Post securing AngloGold Ashanti as a partner for the Nyngan and Nevertire projects, Kincora 
has opportunistically secured (on a 100% ownership basis) the Nyngan West, Nyngan South 
and Nevertire South projects (covering 1,377 km2) which are viewed as hosting shallow to 
moderate covered sections of the targeted Macquarie Arc and the extensions of intrusive 
complex targets included in the existing earn-in partnership with AngloGold Ashanti. 
Kincora seeks to continue to systematically advance its project pipeline within the under cover 
extension of the Macquarie Arc and bring in funding and technical partners. 
About the AngloGold Ashanti Partnership 
Kincora has an initial multiple-phase Earn-in and Joint Venture Agreement with AngloGold 
Ashanti for the Nyngan and Nevertire licenses 5.  
AngloGold has the right to spend up to A$50 million to earn a 80% interest through: 
• A$25 million of exploration expenditure to earn a 70% joint venture interest (Phase I) 
including a minimum A$2 million expenditure obligation, with Kincora the initial operator 
for a 10% management fee.  
 
• Completion of a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) or funding of a further $25 million of 
expenditure to earn a 80% joint venture interest (Phase II). 
 
• Under the agreement a wide range of untested large intrusive-related copper-gold targets 
will be drill tested seeking to confirm the potential for a new district of copper-gold porphyry 
system complexes. 
AngloGold Ashanti is the world’s fourth largest gold miner by production with a successful 
track record for new Greenfield discovery success. Within the Macquarie Arc, AngloGold 
Ashanti has secured Earn-in and Joint Venture Agreements with both Kincora and Inflection 
Resources (Inflection, ticker “AUCU.CSE”) covering greater than 8,000km2 in the NJNB. 
Subject to permitting, access and weather conditions Kincora and AngloGold Ashanti’s first 
drilling program is anticipated to commence within the month. The program seeks to test new 
district-scale potential with up to eight large intrusive complex targets to be drill-tested for the 
first time in this initial first phase program. Approximately 6 to 8 drill holes for an estimated 
4000-5000 metres are budgeted to be complete before the summer break 6.

Figure 3: Kincora has recently secure three prior explorer drill holes for the Nevertire 
South project with relogging planned as discussions with potential technical and funding 
partners progress 
Kincora has recently obtained from the Cadia mine site diamond core farm three prior Newcrest drill holes, one of 
which confirms a highly prospective Phase 4 Macquarie Arc intrusive complex. These are in addition to other earlier 
holes being available at the WB Clarke Geoscience Centre Londonderry drillcore library. 
 
 
 
 
About Fleet Space Technologies Partnership  
In July 2024, Kincora formed an initial partnership with Fleet Space for a three phase ANT and 
gravity geophysical survey at the Nyngan project 7. These surveys commenced in early August, 
are ongoing and progressing well. 
 
The initial ANT survey is planned to cover an area of approximately 35 km2 across the northern 
Nyngan license area with a proposed infill area of approximately 9 km2. Similar to other Fleet 
Space surveys in the district, the ANT velocity model is anticipated to image down to 1900m 
depth with the ground gravity surveys to provide the first cover-corrected gravity dataset in the 
area.  
 
The rapid turnaround from completion of the surveys to interpretation of results is enabled by 
the real-time ANT data acquisition capabilities of Fleet Space’s end-to-end mineral exploration 
solution, ExoSphere.  Utilising Fleet Space’s proprietary satellite constellation, ExoSphere’s  
smart seismic sensors (Geodes) transmit high-quality 3D ANT data from the project to the 
satellites which is then processed into actionable insights in real-time. Leveraging the benefits 
of satellite connectivity, rapid 3D subsurface imaging, and AI - ExoSphere streamlines data 
acquisition, processing, integration and interpretation while optimising data quality to enhance 
the precision of drill hole targeting. 
 
Fleet Space is Australia’s leading space company and is seeking to revolutionise humanity’s 
search for critical minerals, space exploration, and defence with its satellite-enabled solutions 
and AI-powered, end-to-end mineral exploration technology, ExoSphere.
