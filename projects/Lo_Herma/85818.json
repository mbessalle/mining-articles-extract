    "description": "Ti Uranium ASX Announcement | 30 January 2025 Glienergy. ASXGTR Two of Three Water Wells Completed and Staking Finalised at the Lo Herma ISR Uranium Project « Two groundwater monitoring wells drilled and completed « Drilling of third groundwater monitoring well in progress « Staking of additional claims finalised « Performance Rights vested following successful resource upgrade GTI Energy Ltd (GTI or Company) is pleased to advise that the drilling and development of two (2) of the three (3) planned groundwater monitoring wells has been completed with drilling of the third well underway at the Lo Herma ISR Uranium Project (Lo Herma or the Project) located in Wyoming's Powder River Basin. The groundwater monitoring holes will facilitate testing of the hydraulic parameters within the subterranean aquifer containing the Lo Herma ore body, to confirm suitability for ISR mining. Subject to favourable weather conditions, this phase of drilling is expected to be completed in the coming weeks prior to the commencement of aquifer testing. The results of aquifer hydrology testing, along with soon to be finalised metallurgical test results, are important inputs into the Lo Herma Scoping Study which is in progress. As previously advised on 13/11/2024, the Company secured staking rights for 23 additional claims (443 acres) to extend the Lo Herma project area along projected mineralised trends. Staking and filing of the final 8 claims, that were held under NOITL, have now finalised such that all 23 claims have been completed and are included in the recently updated exploration targets at Lo Herma (Table 1).
