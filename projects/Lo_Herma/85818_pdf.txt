ASX Announcement | 30 January 2025

Two of Three Water Wells Completed and Staking Finalised
at the Lo Herma ISR Uranium Project
Highlights
● Two groundwater monitoring wells drilled and completed
● Drilling of third groundwater monitoring well in progress
● Staking of additional claims finalised
● Performance Rights vested following successful resource upgrade
GTI Energy Ltd (GTI or Company) is pleased to advise that the drilling and development of two (2)
of the three (3) planned groundwater monitoring wells has been completed with drilling of the third
well underway at the Lo Herma ISR Uranium Project (Lo Herma or the Project) located in Wyoming’s
Po wder River Basin. The groundwater monitoring holes will facilitate testing of the hydraulic
parameters within the subterranean aquifer containing the Lo Herma ore body, to confirm suitability
for ISR mining. Subject to favourable weather conditions, this phase of drilling is expected to be
completed in the coming weeks prior to the commencement of aquifer testing. The results of aquifer
hydrology testing, along with soon to be finalised metallurgical test results, are important inputs into
the Lo Herma Scoping Study which is in progress.
As previously advised on 13/11/2024, the Company secured staking rights for 23 additional claims
(443 acres) to extend the Lo Herma project area along projected mineralised trends. Staking and filing
of the final 8 claims, that were held under NOITL, have now finalised such that all 23 claims have
been completed and are included in the recently updated exploration targets at Lo Herma (Table 1).

PERFORMANCE RIGHTS VESTED FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL RESOURCE UPGRADE
Following the successful completion of drilling at Lo Herma on 19 September 2024, the subsequent
upgrade of the Lo Herma Mineral Resource Estimate to 8.57Mlbs U O (ASX on 12/12/2024), and the
3 8
acquisition of newly staked claims advised on 13 November 2024; the Board has resolved that the
following performance milestones have been met in relation to the Class C & D Performance Rights.
• Completion, by the end of 2024, of exploration that includes the drilling of at least 10,000 meters
(32,800 feet) of new drill holes combined across one or more of the Company’s projects including any
new projects acquired during the period (Class C, Milestone 1).
• Securing a new mineral exploration or development project or securing exploration & development
access rights to an additional material (to be determined by the board) area of mineral claims (Class
C, Milestone 3).
• The Company announcing to ASX, an increased Mineral Resource in accordance with JORC 2012
such that the Mineral Resource Estimate (MI&I) is at least 7.5mlbs at Lo Herma at average grades of
at least 0.04% eU O (350ppm) above a minimum cutoff of 0.02 (20 ppm), minimum thickness 1 meter
3 8
& a minimum grade thickness (GT) product of 0.2 (Classes C & D, Milestones 9 & 1 respectively).
• The Company announcing to ASX an updated total Mineral Resource Estimate in accordance with
JORC 2012 of at least 10Mlbs in aggregate across any of the USA projects combined, at average
grades of at least 0.04 % eU O (350 ppm) above a minimum cut-off of 0.02 (Class D, Milestone 5).
3 8
Accordingly, 75% of Performance Rights Class C (ASX:GTRAI) and 50% of Class D (ASX:GTRAN) on
issue have vested and are capable of exercise.
GTI PROJECTS SUMMARY
Lo Herma is GTI’s flagship asset however GTI also holds high potential, drill permitted projects in
Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin and Green Mountain area, as well as brownfields conventional
uranium/vanadium assets in Utah’s Henry Mountains.

The potential quantity and grade of Exploration Targets is conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration
to estimate a JORC-compliant MRE. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a MRE in the defined
exploration target areas. In addition to drilling conducted in 2024, Exploration Targets have been estimated based on
historical drill maps, drill hole data, aerial geophysics (as reported during 2023) and drilling by GTI conducted during 2023
to verify the historical drilling information. There are now 954 drill holes in the Lo Herma project area with the drill programs
conducted by GTI during 2023 and 2024 designed, in part, to test the Lo Herma Exploration Target.
