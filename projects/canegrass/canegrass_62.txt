Viking Mines Managing Director & CEO Julian Woodcock said:
“The transaction which we have negotiated brings 100% of the Canegrass Battery Minerals
Project under Vikings’ direct ownership and control for the benefit of our shareholders.
“The Project has continuously exceeded our expectations as we have completed extensive
technical advancements throughout Stage 1 and 2 of the Farm-In.
“Highlights include a substantial MRE upgrade, which in turn delivered a highly positive Pit
Optimisation Study. This has reaffirmed the Company’s belief that there is substantial inherent
value within this exceptional Vanadium and Magnetite Project.
“Metallurgical testwork continues to derisk the Project with the delivery for the first time for the
Project Vanadium Pentoxide (V O ) flake, unlocking the pathway to a flowsheet for production.
2 5
Additionally, testwork continues to examine the opportunity of producing concentrates of Cu,
Ni, Co and Ti using various methods on both the magnetic concentrate and non-magnetic tail.
“The Company believes there is significant upside potential for the Canegrass Project, with the
vanadium sector continuing to grow through the adoption of Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries
(VRFB’s) as critical long-term energy storage solution for the growing renewable energy sector.”
TRANSACTION TERMS
The transaction negotiated sees Viking attain 100% ownership of the Project via the acquisition
of Red Hawks subsidiary Flinders Canegrass Pty Ltd.
With the completion of Stage 2 of the FIA, the Project tenure is held across 2 entities, Viking
Critical Minerals (49%) and Flinders Canegrass Pty Ltd (51%).
Flinders Canegrass Pty Ltd is being purchased by Viking via a binding Share Sale Agreement
(“SSA”) entered in to with Red Hawk for the consideration of:
• $175,000 cash payment;
• 33,333,333 shares in Viking (50% held in voluntary escrow for 3 months and
50% for 6 months); and
• 15,000,000 options* exercisable at 2c with expiry 3 years from the date of issue.
*The terms and conditions of the options are included in a schedule to this announcement.
The new shares and options issued to Red Hawk will utilise the Company’s existing placement
capacity under Listing Rule 7.1 and will rank equally with existing VKA shares on issue. The
issued shares will see Red Hawk become a top 20 shareholder with 3.15% of the increased
capital in the Company.

CANEGRASS BATTERY MINERALS PROJECT
The Canegrass Battery Minerals Project is located in the Murchison region, 620km north-east
of Perth, Western Australia. It is accessed via sealed roads from the nearby township of Mt
Magnet to within 22km of the existing Resources. The Project contains a large JORC (2012)
Global Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 146Mt at 0.70% V O , 31.8% Fe & 6.6%

Viking completed a Pit Optimisation Study (POS) on the Canegrass Global MRE, which proved
highly successfully delivering a large high-grade pit constrained MRE totalling 61Mt @ 0.81%
V O & 35.9% Fe, see ASX Announcement 18 March 2024. The Fold Nose Deposit delivered

VANADIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERIES – GREEN ENERGY FUTURE
Viking Mines recognise the significant importance of Vanadium in decarbonisation through the
growth of the Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (“VRFB’s”) sector.
VRFB’s are a developing market as an alternate solution to lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) in specific large
energy storage applications. Guidehouse Insights Market Intelligence White Paperi published
in 2Q 2022 forecasts the VRFB sector to grow >900% by 2031 through the installation of large,
fixed storage facilities (Figure 1).
Figure 1; Forecast growth of the VRFB Sector through to 2031 (source – Guidehouse Insightsi)
The reason for this forecast growth is that VRFB’s have unique qualities and advantages over
Li-ion in the large energy storage sector to complement renewable energy sources to store the
energy produced. They are durable, maintain a long lifespan with near unlimited
charge/discharge cycles, have low operating costs, safe operation (no fire risk) and have a low
environmental impact in both manufacturing and recycling. The Vanadium electrolyte used in
these batteries is fully recyclable at the end of the battery’s life.
Importantly, and unlike Li-ion, the battery storage capacity is only limited by the size of the
electrolyte storage tanks. This means that with a VRFB installation, increasing energy storage
capacity is only a matter of adding in additional electrolyte (via the installation of additional
electrolyte storage tanks) without needing to expand the core system components. Increasing
the energy storage directly reduces the levelized cost per kWh over the installation’s lifetime.
This is not an option with Li-ion batteries.
It is for these reasons that VRFB’s are an ideal fit for many storage applications requiring longer
duration discharge and more than 20 years of operation with minimal maintenance.
