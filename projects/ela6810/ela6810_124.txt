ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 26 NOVEMBER 2024
Antimony Project Acquired in Australia's Premier Province
HIGHLIGHTS
 Exploration Licence to be granted for a period of six years and covering a significant
package of 391 km2 of prospective ground within the Southern New England
Orogen of NSW, Australia’s premier Antimony Province
 The tenement extends over an 85km strike extent of the Peel Fault System, a
known mineralised structural corridor, and includes multiple known Antimony and
Gold mineral occurrences
 The best reported historical results to date include 465ppm Sb and 0.224ppm Au
 Given limited previous exploration these historical sampling results represent a
significant greenfield discovery opportunity for Antimony and Gold
 Antimony prices have surged to ~US$33,500 per metric ton* as of 21 November
following China’s recent export ban on a wide range of Antimony products
Red Mountain Mining Limited (“RMX” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the
receipt of a Notice of Proposed Grant of Exploration Licence (relating to ELA6810) from
the NSW Department of Primary Industries. The project encompasses 391km2 of
prospective ground within the Southern New England Orogen (SNEO) in northeastern
New South Wales. The SNEO is recognised as Australia’s premier Antimony province
(Figure 1). Antimony occurs in hydrothermal quartz veins, breccias and stockworks, often
with associated gold and/or tungsten mineralisation.

ASX RELEASE
The Hillgrove project (ASX: LRV) is approximately 20km east of Armidale, is Australia’s largest known
Antimony deposit. The mine has recorded production of over 730,000 oz of gold and over 50,000 tonnes of
Antimony and a remaining resource of 1.7Moz Au equivalent at a grade of 7.4g/t Au equivalent, including
90,000 tonnes of Antimony, with significant exploration upside1.
Project Geology
The project lies approximately 100km west of Hillgrove and extends for 85km immediately west of the Peel
Fault. The geology of the tenement is dominated by isoclinally folded Carboniferous metasediments of the
Tamworth Belt (Figure 2), which is a forearc basinal package related to west-dipping subduction of oceanic
crust beneath the Lachlan Orogen. Ultramafic melanges of the Great Serpentinite Belt, which outcrop along
the Peel Fault, are considered to be remnants of this oceanic crust. The Peel Fault System has recognised
world-class mineral potential, with over 400 known orogenic gold and base metal mineral occurrences along
its over 400km strike extent, but is underexplored with less than 200 mostly shallow drillholes over its length,
the majority of which are focused on discrete prospects.

Namoi Fault (NF) are indicated.

ASX RELEASE
Tamworth Belt metasediments within the project are cut by multiple splays off the Peel Fault, including the
major Namoi Fault (Figure 2). Gold, Antimony and Tungsten mineralisation are associated with orogenic
quartz-vein and stockwork systems hosted within the Peel Fault System. The tenement encompasses nine
historical gold workings (a mixture of primary orogenic vein-style and deep alluvial workings); three vein-
hosted Antimony occurrences with historical workings; and one vein-hosted tungsten occurrence.
Previous exploration within the NSW Antimony project
The 391km2 area covered by the project contains no historical mineral exploration drilling and has seen
limited previous surface exploration for Antimony and Gold mineralisation. No soil sampling for these
elements has been undertaken and rockchip and stream sediment coverage is limited, leaving the majority
of the tenement untested, with significant potential for discovery.
The Geological Survey of NSW’s (GSNSW) open file geochemical database contains 116 historical rockchip
samples within the tenement, all of which have been analysed for Antimony and Gold. Almost all of these
samples are concentrated around the three known Antimony mineral occurrences in the southeast corner
and mid-northern portion of the tenement (Figure 3). Most of the tenement, including the majority of the
known gold mineral occurrences, has not been sampled. The best reported results to date are 465ppm Sb
and 0.224ppm Au, as shown on Figure 3.
Figure 3: Previous rockchip sampling in and around ELA6810
ASX: RMX 3

ASX RELEASE
GSNSW’s database also contains 294 stream sediment samples within ELA6810, 141 of which have been
analysed for Antimony and Gold. These samples are also mostly concentrated around the two mid-northern
Antimony occurrences (Figure 4) and the majority of the tenement, including most of the known Au mineral
occurrences, has not been sampled.
The stream sediment samples taken around the known Antimony occurrences had a high detection limit for
Antimony of 5ppm and only one sample (18ppm Sb) was above this limit. The highest gold value for stream
sediments within the tenement is 0.003ppm, returned by multiple samples. The Peel Fault immediately east
of the northern portion of the tenement is strongly anomalous for Antimony and Gold in stream sediment
samples.

ASX RELEASE
RMX plans to commence exploration in early 2025
RMX is currently completing a compilation of available government and open file company data to identify
priority areas for on-ground exploration, which will include known Antimony and Gold mineral occurrences.
The Company has engaged consultants to undertake a land ownership search across the tenement and will
commence direct engagement with landholders during the first quarter of 2025 to secure access for surface
sampling and geological mapping.

include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and
appropriate sectional views. |  Appropriate location diagram is presented in
the text. The diagram is indicative only as no
assumptions of grade, extent or depth are
made.
Balanced
reporting |  Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results. |  Only pertinent results are given as due to the
relevance of the announcement.
Other
substantive
exploration
data |  Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including
(but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples |  There is no other substantive exploration
data provided or withheld as this
announcement deals with this early phase
exploration target.
