# NevGold Increases the Size of the Zeus Copper Project by Approximately 50% Or 1,000 Hectares in the Hercules Copper District, Idaho

Vancouver, British Columbia, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NevGold Corp. (“**NevGold** ” or the “**Company** ”) **(TSXV:NAU) (OTCQX:NAUFF) (Frankfurt:5E50**) is pleased to announce that it has staked an additional 147 claims, approximately 1,000 hectares or 10 square kilometers, with strong geological prospectivity at the Zeus Copper Project in the emerging Hercules Copper Trend of southwestern Idaho. As highlighted in NevGold’s previous News Releases from 2024 and 2025 to date ([_see NevGold News Releases_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JJaDYuwN8Te-PUwHIP01c_m1SfUy8qZWIvLj6hciT0piqHhL4JpQXU-YHdqzhvm-8OSsunCfyxj_AXFF6d3gU3lBoGbHKY7jd6SAwPHttG0=))**,** the **Zeus Copper Project** shares many **geological similarities** with **Hercules Metals Corp.’s (“Hercules Metals”, TSXV:BIG)** copper porphyry discovery at the **Hercules Project** ([_see Hercules Metals News Releases_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fKr1dkePKj7ycK3RwWX6z624wv60gyYnIvYpcYHNwXGBvxWi5Eb0zescXqHw7yIyIoskiLWplUcFG1P1pMTzVORL9mEfFrth7r-2SB0Enpds-wtXfbOCc4T_inYMFYH8)), including **comparable soil survey geochemical results (see Figure 1, Figure 4)**. 

**_Key Highlights_**

  * **Zeus Copper Project now encompasses 392 claims, approximately 2,900 hectares or 29 square kilometers** , of highly **strategic** and **prospective** ground in the Hercules Copper Trend 


  * New additional ground staked by the NevGold team is**underlain by the two primary host rocks of copper mineralization in the Hercules Copper Trend, the Lower Huntington Formation and Triassic age intrusive rocks**


  * Strong similarities are noted between the Zeus Copper Project and the Hercules Metals copper porphyry discovery at the Hercules Project


  * **Field programs will advance including planned geophysical surveys to identify drill targets**

**NevGold CEO, Brandon Bonifacio, comments:**_“We are very pleased to have added additional ground with all of the_** _right geologic signatures at our Zeus Copper Project. After our recent soil survey results, it is positive we were able to acquire more ground adjacent to our initial claim block, in an area that looks to be an emerging copper trend._**_The recently staked ground is also_** _adjacent to a large claim block that Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX) has established on the trend (see Figure 1 and Figure 2)_**_. There continues to be a high level of activity on the Hercules Copper Trend, and we have been a first-mover and have continued to strategically add some of the most prospective ground in the district. Along with adding to our land position, we have also actively continued our field work program, and due to positive results, we will continue with our geophysical program to define drill targets by the 2025 summer field season.”_

**NevGold VP Exploration, Greg French, comments:**_“We are very excited about the additional ground that we have been able to stake in this emerging copper trend in the Western USA. The_** _land that we recently staked contains one of the last available erosional windows through post-mineral basalts. These windows expose the highly-prospective Lower Huntington Formation and Triassic plutons, the main hosts of porphyry copper mineralization on the Hercules Copper Trend_** _. Our technical team has gained a strong understanding of the district geology over the past year, and we will continue to leverage this competitive advantage as we advance our highly prospective Zeus Copper Project.”_

**_Newly-Staked Zeus Claims_**

_Figure 2 – Geology of expanded NevGold Zeus Copper Project land position. The newly staked claims contain Lower Huntington Formation (purple) and Triassic age plutons (brown), both are known to host copper mineralization on the Hercules Copper Trend. Post-mineral basalts and sediments (tan) cover a significant portion of the Hercules Copper Trend and obscure any potential mineralization. Modified from (__Henricksen, 1975), (Fankhauser, 1968), (Skurla, 1974), (Lund, 2021), (Adair, 1985)._[__To view image please click here__](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0-lteoPT3X1HUJP9BDBmTsxbnAjVi_sZC4NkDiexcEgUgDnPMqK9w_km8gO_h3hZqVTr62qCQ96UMIQ69hKO2J48BUef10ZJSHuxMeY_Yi30_IZ7Vdk-TM6cIWASLucDAMiHeMO3XYlJrfjI4fFfXkJTxGvtUzHuljd13Tndhjz2nnsckDisKsGY_m0oJQKs)

The newly staked claims are southwest and on trend with the existing Zeus Copper Project and cover an area with outcropping Lower Huntington Formation and Triassic age intrusive rocks (plutons). Both of these rock units are highly prospective for copper mineralization and are believed to be the main hosts of porphyry copper mineralization in the Hercules Copper Trend. This area is an important erosional window through the post-mineral basalt cover rocks, which conceal most of the prospective rock units in the Hercules Copper Trend. Additionally, most of the surrounding ground around Zeus has been staked by Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX) who have been conducting a very aggressive exploration campaign throughout the Hercules Copper Trend.

The stratigraphy that is considered the most prospective to host porphyry copper mineralization includes the Lower Huntington Formation (purple) and Triassic age plutons (brown). Silver mineralization is known to be hosted in Upper Huntington Formation (blue), including the Hercules Rhyolite, as well as the underlying (older) stratigraphy. _[__To view image please click here__](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0-lteoPT3X1HUJP9BDBmTsxbnAjVi_sZC4NkDiexcEhVWc_YzLH46FRwUxzAHCJ0aHPj0bMzCT_a3OjKVP3TqYhcYZ9QxbKxokX6BjgrrkeqUTGcCiMQ9f2vieV91XF6D-alrvl79hjwMYfqoF4b3FsHMVAnNR2NHq_GQ2ceu-NdQcc_YlluPaBsHcFFT-XV)

**_Planned 2025 Activities / Status Update_**

  * Geological database review **(completed)** ; 


  * Geological mapping **(continuous)** ;


  * Comprehensive surface geochemical sampling **(completed)** ;


  * Ground geophysical program **(in preparation)** ;
