About the Southern Cross Gold Project  
The Southern Cross Project is located 380km east of Perth, southeast of Southern Cross in the Yilgarn 
Goldfield. The project comprises 16 Prospecting Licences and 7 Exploration Licences with a combined 
area of 197 km², over mostly contiguous tenements covering over 40km of strike of the Southern 
Cross Greenstone Belt, which has historically produced around 15Moz gold, predominantly from the 
Marvel Loch and Southern Cross centres, both of which are in operation to varying extents.  
The project area is serviced by sealed roads, grid power, scheme water, rail and town amenities. 
Minjar operates the Marvel Loch plant nearby and Ramelius Resources operates the Edna May facility 
some 60 kilometres to the west.
