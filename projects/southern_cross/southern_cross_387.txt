ASX ANNOUNCEMENT  
19 February 2025 
 
Applications for High-Potential WA Lithium & Gold 
Tenements Secured 
 
HIGHLIGHTS: 
• 
Applications for seven (7) exploration licences in the highly prospective Southern Cross 
Greenstone Belt secured 
• 
Southern Cross Greenstone Belt is a world-class mining district with deformed greenstone 
sequences, lithium-bearing pegmatites, and proximity to signiﬁcant gold systems – it 
extends from the Earl Grey Lithium Mine (mineral resource estimate 189Mt @ 1.53% Li₂O1) 
to north of the Marvel Loch Gold Centre 
• 
Chariot is committed to progressing the ﬂagship Black Mountain Lithium Project in the U.S. 
while continuing to unlock value in Western Australia 
Chariot Corporation Limited (ASX: CC9) (“Chariot” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its seven 
(7) applications for exploration licences in the Southern Cross Greenstone Belt in Western Australia, 
which are held through a wholly owned subsidiary.  
The Southern Cross Greenstone Belt, one of Western Australia's most signiﬁcant gold-producing 
regions with over 150 mines, is now emerging as a key region for lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) 
pegmatites. 
The recent application for E77/3274, together with the six prior applications, will establish a 
substantial exploration position for Chariot in the Southern Cross Greenstone Belt upon grant. 
Chariot's strategic, countercyclical approach in Western Australia has enabled the Company to secure 
high-potential licenses relinquished by gold exploration companies in 2023 and lithium exploration 
companies in 2024 - positioning itself ahead of the next lithium exploration cycle. 
Chariot has a strong track record in monetising lithium assets in Western Australia, highlighted by the 
proﬁtable sale of fourteen (14) exploration licences to St George Mining Limited (“St George Mining”) 
in 2023. As part of the transaction with St George Mining, Chariot retained royalty and milestone 
payment interests, ensuring continued exposure to the upside potential of the sold licences.

The applications are strategically positioned between the Earl Grey Lithium Mine (189Mt @ 1.53% Li₂O) 
and the Marvel Loch Gold Centre, within the highly prospective Archean Yilgarn Craton, which is 
renowned for its lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites and high-grade gold deposits.  
Key geological attributes 
: 
• 
Deformed greenstone sequences with late-stage granitic intrusions. 
• 
Structural corridors hosting lithium-bearing pegmatites. 
• 
Proximity to the Marvel Loch gold system, a signiﬁcant gold-producing region. 
Priority Exploration Targets (Upon Grant) 
• 
E77/3088 – Flagged as a high-potential target for both gold and lithium and will be the initial focus 
for exploration. 
• 
E77/3274 – Contains the Gem rubellite bearing pegmatite and has gold exploration potential. The 
tenement lies within the maﬁc greenstone belt, which hosts the Earl Grey lithium deposit and 
Bounty gold deposit. 
• 
E77/3076 & E77/3078 – Prospective for pegmatite hosted lithium, with potentially favourable 
structural settings.

Western Australia Work Programs 
Chariot has engaged ERM Sustainable Mining Services for a geological review of the applications. Upon 
grant, exploration activities at the tenements are proposed to include: 
• 
Geological mapping 
• 
Surface sampling 
• 
Geochemical surveys 
• 
Drill programs based on results
