# Manning Ventures Stakes Additional Claims Adjacent to the Copper Hill Project, Nevada, USA

Vancouver, British Columbia, May 23, 2024 – TheNewswire – Manning Ventures Inc. (the “Company” or “Manning”) (CSE: MANN; Frankfurt: 1H5) is pleased to announce []()that it has staked an additional forty-two (42) new unpatented lode mining claims (351.2 Ha/868 acres) adjacent to the claim block at Copper Hill. The Project is now comprised of 108 unpatented lode claims that cover 896.3 Ha (2,215 acres). 

 

The claim block was expanded to cover newly identified target zones from geologic mapping that is in-progress, recent gravity survey results, recent soil geochemical results, and new U.S. Geological Survey regional magnetic data. 

 

Current surface mapping in-progress by Manning has identified geologic controls for copper-bearing skarn mineralization, zoning of the skarn mineralization, and alteration veining in the Jurassic Granodiorite and Feldspar Porphyry. 

 

The recent gravity survey identified strong indicators for copper in skarn that would be expected around a porphyry copper deposit, previously unrecognized fault trends, and geology that is favorable for copper target zones beneath post-mineral volcanic rocks that has never been drill tested. 

 

Recent soil geochemical results correspond with known copper mineralization, skarn zoning, and trends that highlight the skarn/geology mapping correlations.  In addition, it corresponds with skarn zoning and gravity indications of skarn, and correlates/aligns with gravity-based fault trends.  U.S. Geological Survey Magnetic data is sufficiently detailed to highlight several trends in the Project ground magnetic data.

About the Copper Hill Project

 

Located within the prolific Walker Lane trend in southern Nevada, Copper Hill is situated one of the premier jurisdictions for precious metals mining in the world.  Historic endowment within Walker Lane includes 50Moz Au, 700Moz Ag, and 4Mt Cu.  Copper Hill hosts copper-gold-molybdenum mineralization in both porphyry and skarn styled deposits in Mineral County, Nevada. The property consists of 66 mineral claims covering an area of 2.3 miles. The property is located 22 miles north of Hawthorne, Nevada and is accessible using well-maintained County Roads. 

 

The Project is centered on a Jurassic Age quartz monzonite porphyry intruding Triassic age Luning Limestone. The claims cover 2.3 sq miles and are 33 miles east of the Yerington Copper District which hosts the Yerington Copper Mine (Anaconda 1952-1978), Ann Mason Deposit, Bear Deposit, MacArthur Deposit, and the Pumpkin Hollow Mine. 

 

Historically at Copper Hill, reported high-grade copper was mined from underground shafts from skarn and porphyry-copper styled mineralization at the Copper Mountain Mine.   Between 1914 to 1926 mining from the “Copper Mountain Mine” produced an estimated 1,000,000 pounds of copper from shallow underground workings. Historic reporting from the period of production describes ore zones of contact skarn- type and porphyry-type mineralization with shipping grades ranging from 3.5 to 11.0% copper*. 

 

*Historic Mining information was summarized from an “Unpublished Report on the Carson Sink Area, Nevada by F.C. Schrader, U.S. Geological Survey (Field work 1911-1920) 1947”.  Manning Ventures cautions investors that the historic exploration and production information is believed to be accurate but has not been verified by a qualified person.  

 

The Copper Hill mineralizing system forms a topographic high surrounded and partially covered by younger volcanic rocks. Mineralization identified at Copper Hill are bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, chrysocolla, copper-native, covellite, cuprite, gold, malachite, molybdenite, silver, sphalerite (rare), and tetrahedrite. 

 

The Copper Mountain area was explored between 1959 to 1979 by Idaho Minning Corp. and Walker-Martel who conducted ground geophysics, underground mapping, prospecting and reported 6000 feet of Rotary drilling.  Since that time ground magnetics were conducted in 2007.  

Rock sampling collected at this time returned values from select samples of 7.2% and 12.7% copper and 1.06 g/t gold and 1.19 g/t gold respectively. 

 

The target being sought at Copper Hill is a porphyry styled copper-molybdenum-gold deposit.
