ABOUT ADELONG GOLD 
Adelong Gold Limited (ASX:ADG) is a mineral exploration company advancing towards gold production at its 
flagship Adelong Goldfield Project in southern New South Wales (NSW). The Company also owns highly 
prospective lithium tenement packages in the prolific ‘Lithium Valley’ of Minas Gerais and in Paraiba Province 
within the Borborema Region, both located in Brazil. 
Acquired in May 2020, the Adelong Goldfield spans 70km² and 188,000oz, following  a maiden JORC Resource 
for the Perkins West deposit at Gibraltar of 18,300oz. With significant potential for resource expansion at 
depth and along strike, the project represents a key growth opportunity for the Company. 
In October 2024, Adelong Gold entered a binding farm-in agreement with Great Divide Mining (ASX:GDM) 
for a staged acquisition of a 51% interest in the Adelong Gold Project. GDM completed due diligence in 
January 2025 and will invest $300,000 for an initial 15% stake in Challenger Gold Mines Pty Ltd (CGM), the 
project operator. GDM will increase its stake to 51% upon achieving first gold production within 12 months, 
while Adelong will retain a 49% interest with no cash contributions required until production commences. 
Operationally, the focus is on rapidly restarting the modern Adelong Gold Plant, constructed in 2016/17, with 
the goal of resuming production within 12 months. Concurrently, exploration and feasibility studies aim to 
expand the resource base beyond the current estimate, bolstering the project's long-term potential. GDM’s 
role as operator ensures hands-on management to fast-track production and position the Adelong Gold 
Project as a regional hub for gold production. 
This partnership with GDM represents a pivotal step forward for Adelong Gold. By combining GDM’s 
operational expertise with Adelong’s established resource base, the project is well-positioned to achieve 
near-term production and unlock significant value for shareholders. 
In December 2023, Adelong acquired a 100% interest in three lithium exploration permits for the Santa Rita 
do Aracuai Lithium Project in the renowned ‘Lithium Valley’ of Minas Gerais, Brazil. This acquisition secures 
a strategic foothold in a globally significant, mining-friendly region known for its hard-rock lithium 
spodumene deposits, alongside major discoveries by Sigma Lithium, Latin Resources, and Lithium Ionic. 
Exploration at Santa Rita commenced in December 2023, with an initial reconnaissance program completed 
in February 2024 identifying two key areas for further investigation. Geological assessments highlighted 
potential lithium mineralisation within Neoproterozoic formations, including the Macaúbas Group and 
Salinas Formation, with plans for detailed mapping and geochemical analysis to identify pegmatitic bodies 
and lithium indicators. 
In March 2024, Adelong expanded its Brazilian portfolio by securing ten additional licenses at the Paraíba 
Province Project, increasing its exploration area by 162.8km². These licenses target lithium pegmatites within 
the Borborema Region, known for its Proterozoic rock formations hosting tantalum, beryl, niobium, 
aquamarine, and lithium-associated pegmatites.
