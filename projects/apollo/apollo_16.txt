Adelong Gold Acquires Advanced, High-Grade Gold Project 
Victoria, Australia 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• 
Adelong Gold has executed a binding purchase agreement to acquire a 100% 
interest in EL006430, to be renamed the Apollo Gold Project in Victoria, Australia 
• 
The project is located within the highly prospective “Melbourne Zone” that hosts 
Southern Cross Gold’s Sunday Creek project and features multiple zones of thick, 
high-grade gold mineralisation, presenting an immediate exploration and 
development opportunity 
• 
Exceptional high-grade drill results highlight the potential for bulk tonnage gold 
mineralisation, including: 
o 77m at 1.14 g/t Au, from surface in 22GMRC12, including: 
 
35m at 1.85 g/t Au, from Surface6 
o 39.5m at 7.25 g/t Au, from 118.6m to 158.1m in GMDH28, including: 
 
10.6m at 17.1 g/t Au, from 137.85m to 148.45m1 
o 27.6m at 6.7 g/t Au, from 59m to 86.6m in GMDH30, including: 
 
8.0m at 11.9 g/t Au, from 71m to 79m2 
o 28m at 10.2 g/t Au, from 138m to 166m in GMDH36, including: 
 
13m at 17.5 g/t Au, from 139m to 152m3

 
15.9m at 6.93 g/t Au, from 219.1m to 235m5 
o 47m at 2.7 g/t Au, from 68m to 115m in GMDH35, including: 
 
4m at 11.8 g/t Au, from 91 to 95m3 
o 5.8m at 18.4 g/t Au, from 91.8m to 97.6m in GMDH26, including: 
 
4.6m at 22.68 g/t Au from 93m1 
• 
The mineralisation remains open at depth and along strike, providing strong potential 
for further large-scale high-grade discoveries 
• 
Adelong Gold is sufficiently funded and will move rapidly to commence further 
exploration drilling and resource definition, targeting high-grade extensions and 
untested fault zones 
• 
The tenement features multiple occurrences of antimony in massive stibnite and is 
consistent with other Au-Sb projects in the region, such as the Costerfield mine, 
Sunday Creek 
 
 
 
 
 
Adelong Gold Limited (ASX:ADG) (Adelong Gold or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has executed 
a binding purchase agreement with Currawong Resources Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Pacific 
Gold Corporation (TSXV:GPAC), to acquire a 100% interest in Exploration Licence 006430 (EL006430) in 
Victoria, Australia. 
The  Project (to be renamed the Apollo Gold Project) is highly prospective for gold and presents an opportunity 
for Adelong Gold to expand its footprint in a region with a strong history of gold mineralisation. The 
acquisition represents a strategic addition to the Company’s portfolio, enhancing its asset base and 
supporting its long-term growth strategy. 
Adelong Gold’s Managing Director, Ian Holland, commented: 
“The acquisition of the Apollo Gold Project is a strategic addition to Adelong Gold’s portfolio, 
complementing our existing assets in Australia. With our existing expertise and technical capabilities, 
we aim to fast-track exploration and unlock the project's full potential. 
This project presents significant exploration potential in a highly prospective region, and we look 
forward to advancing our exploration efforts to unlock value for our shareholders.” 
About the  Project 
The Apollo Gold Project, covered by EL006430, encompasses approximately 102 km² at the under-explored 
northern end of the Walhalla Gold Belt, situated about 120 km northeast of Melbourne, Victoria. The licence, 
originally granted on 8th May 2018, has been extended for an additional five years, now valid until 2028. 
Geological Setting & Exploration Potential 
• 
The Apollo Gold Project features a north-south striking near-vertical fault zone (N-S Zone) with 
gold mineralisation controlled by both east-west faults and granitic dykes. 
• 
The intersection of the Southwest Fault with the N-S Zone has created wide zones of fracturing 
and gold mineralisation. 
• 
The east-west striking granitic dyke swarm (E-W Zone) runs near the Strathbogie granite contact, 
a known host for significant mineralisation. 
• 
Several additional fault zones, including those at Wolfe’s and Faulk’s historic open cuts, remain 
largely untested, with recently approved drill permits targeting these zones for future exploration. 
• 
The tenement is also enriched in antimony, a key indicator of epizonal gold systems, with historical 
rock chip samples and drill intersections confirming Sb mineralisation. This is consistent with 
mineralisation at nearby Costerfield and Sunday Creek, which are known for their high-grade Au-
Sb systems.

ABOUT ADELONG GOLD 
Adelong Gold Limited (ASX:ADG) is a mineral exploration company advancing towards gold production at its 
flagship Adelong Goldfield Project in southern New South Wales (NSW). The Company also owns highly 
prospective lithium tenement packages in the prolific ‘Lithium Valley’ of Minas Gerais and in Paraiba Province 
within the Borborema Region, both located in Brazil. 
Acquired in May 2020, the Adelong Goldfield spans 70km² and 188,000oz, following  a maiden JORC Resource 
for the Perkins West deposit at Gibraltar of 18,300oz. With significant potential for resource expansion at 
depth and along strike, the project represents a key growth opportunity for the Company. 
In October 2024, Adelong Gold entered a binding farm-in agreement with Great Divide Mining (ASX:GDM) 
for a staged acquisition of a 51% interest in the Adelong Gold Project. GDM completed due diligence in 
January 2025 and will invest $300,000 for an initial 15% stake in Challenger Gold Mines Pty Ltd (CGM), the 
project operator. GDM will increase its stake to 51% upon achieving first gold production within 12 months, 
while Adelong will retain a 49% interest with no cash contributions required until production commences. 
Operationally, the focus is on rapidly restarting the modern Adelong Gold Plant, constructed in 2016/17, with 
the goal of resuming production within 12 months. Concurrently, exploration and feasibility studies aim to 
expand the resource base beyond the current estimate, bolstering the project's long-term potential. GDM’s 
role as operator ensures hands-on management to fast-track production and position the Adelong Gold 
Project as a regional hub for gold production. 
This partnership with GDM represents a pivotal step forward for Adelong Gold. By combining GDM’s 
operational expertise with Adelong’s established resource base, the project is well-positioned to achieve 
near-term production and unlock significant value for shareholders. 
In December 2023, Adelong acquired a 100% interest in three lithium exploration permits for the Santa Rita 
do Aracuai Lithium Project in the renowned ‘Lithium Valley’ of Minas Gerais, Brazil. This acquisition secures 
a strategic foothold in a globally significant, mining-friendly region known for its hard-rock lithium 
spodumene deposits, alongside major discoveries by Sigma Lithium, Latin Resources, and Lithium Ionic. 
Exploration at Santa Rita commenced in December 2023, with an initial reconnaissance program completed 
in February 2024 identifying two key areas for further investigation. Geological assessments highlighted 
potential lithium mineralisation within Neoproterozoic formations, including the Macaúbas Group and 
Salinas Formation, with plans for detailed mapping and geochemical analysis to identify pegmatitic bodies 
and lithium indicators. 
In March 2024, Adelong expanded its Brazilian portfolio by securing ten additional licenses at the Paraíba 
Province Project, increasing its exploration area by 162.8km². These licenses target lithium pegmatites within 
the Borborema Region, known for its Proterozoic rock formations hosting tantalum, beryl, niobium, 
aquamarine, and lithium-associated pegmatites.

JORC CODE, 2012 EDITION – TABLE 1 REPORT TEMPLATE 
 Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling techniques 
•
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry
standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments,
etc). These examples should not be taken as
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
•
Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
•
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that
are Material to the Public Report.
•
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been
done this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples
from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more
explanation may be required, such as where there
is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation
types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant

•
Diamond drill holes were geologically logged and
sampled to appropriate geology/mineralisation
boundaries.  Drill core was sawn in half with one
side submitted to the laboratory.  All assays were
undertaken at Onsite Laboratory Services Ltd
(ISO: 9001), located in Bendigo, Victoria.  Fire
assay techniques included a 50g charge and AAS
finish.
•
Samples from RC holes were taken at regular 1
metre intervals.  Samples were split at the rig
using a cone splitter to typically ~5kg.  Samples
were pulverised at the laboratory, fire assay
techniques including a 50g charge and AAS finish
were then applied.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade 
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used 
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of 
such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values 
should be clearly stated. 
• The wider composite intercepts use a 0.5 g/t Au cut-off and carry a 
maximum of 2.0 metres of internal waste.  For the higher-grade 
intervals, a 3.0 g/t Au cut-off is applied.  
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole 
angle is known, its nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
• For the majority of drilling in the central vertical mineralised zone, the 
true widths are approximately half of the down-hole intervals presented 
in the table. 
 
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of 
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of 
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• See main body of report. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not 
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades 
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• The reporting is considered to be balanced given the nature of the 
acquisition and further exploration being planned by Adelong Gold. 
 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be 
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk 
samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; 
bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating substances. 
• All relevant exploration data related to the current sampling has been 
included in this report. 
 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral 
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, 
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, 
provided this information is not commercially sensitive. 
• Project has just been acquired by Adelong Gold and further exploration 
work is in the process of being planned.
