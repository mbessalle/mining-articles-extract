    "description": "° #4 Global Uranium ASX:GUE * 7; and Enrichment OTCQB:GUELF ASX Announcement 12 March 2025 Transformational U.S. Uranium Transaction Acquisition of the Advanced Pine Ridge Uranium Project in Wyoming through strategic partnership with Snow Lake Energy Highlights e Global Uranium and Enrichment Ltd (ASX:GUE) and Snow Lake Resources Ltd trading as Snow Lake Energy (NASDAQ:LITM) have executed a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for the acquisition of 100% of the Pine Ridge Uranium Project in Wyoming's Powder River Basin from Stakeholder Energy, LLC e Pine Ridge is an advanced In-Situ Recovery (ISR) uranium project, located in a leading North American uranium jurisdiction and is primed for accelerated development: o Large district scale opportunity with a substantial initial Exploration Target. o More than 1,200 holes drilled on the property to date, identifying over 140 miles of redox fronts with potential to define a substantial ISR uranium resource base. o Surrounded by global-scale, existing uranium projects held by UEC and Cameco. o Cameco’s Smith Ranch Uranium Mill is located 15km from Pine Ridge with a licensed capacity of 5.5M lbs UsOs p.a. o Drilling expected to commence immediately after acquisition as part of an accelerated work program to advance the project. o Joint Venture management team has significant uranium exploration, development and permitting experience within the Powder River Basin. o Wyoming is the leading uranium-producing region in the U.S., supported by a favourable regulatory environment and streamlined permitting processes. ® Snow Lake is a Nasdag-listed, US-focused uranium and nuclear energy business. Snow Lake will also become a cornerstone investor in GUE, investing A$5.6 million and acquiring a 19.99% in the Company, following completion of a $9.0 million placement. ® Snow Lake CEO Frank Wheatley, will join the Board of Global Uranium as a Non-Executive Director. A new leader in North American carbon-free nuclear energy  Y Global Uranium 772 and Enrichment Global Uranium and Enrichment Limited (ASX: GUE, OTCQB: GUELF) (Global Uranium, GUE or the Company) is pleased to announce that Powder River Basin LLC (Powder River), a Delaware limited liability company the subject of a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between Usuran Resources Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Uranium and Snow Lake Exploration (US) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Snow Lake Energy Resources Ltd trading as Snow Lake Energy (NASDAQ:LITM) (Snow Lake), has executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition of the Pine Ridge Uranium Project (Pine Ridge or Project) from Stakeholder Energy, LLC (SHE) (PSA). The consideration payable by Powder River to acquire a 100% interest in Pine Ridge totals US$22.5 million (Consideration) payable to SHE over three equal 12-month instalments of US$7.5 million, with completion of the acquisition to occur after payment of the first instalment. As part of the JV, Global Uranium and Snow Lake are each responsible for providing 50% of the Consideration and future exploration expenditures. The PSA requires the JV to commit a minimum of US$10 million in exploration expenditure over the initial three-year period. The key terms of the PSA and the JV Agreement are set out at the back of this announcement. Pine Ridge is an advanced uranium project of significant scale with an established Exploration Target range of 24.4 — 51.3 Mlbs Us0g, at an average grade of 0.031% - 0.040% U30s (100% basis). The Project has been significantly de-risked through historic drilling and has an ideal geological foundation to be developed into a production asset. The potential quantity and grade of Pine Ridge’s Exploration Target Range is conceptual in nature. Insufficient modern exploration has been conducted to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral Resource and it is uncertain whether future exploration will lead to the estimation of a Mineral Resource in the defined areas. Commenting on the acquisition and JV, Mr. Andrew Ferrier, Managing Director of GUE said: “We are pleased to announce the acquisition of the Pine Ridge Uranium Project, an advanced project with significant scale potential in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Currently, the Basin is dominated by four globally significant uranium companies and this strategic move positions Global Uranium in the heart of this important uranium district. “We are pleased to welcome Snow Lake Energy as a strategic partner, who have recognised the strength of Global Uranium’s existing portfolio and our value as a partner in the Pine Ridge Project. The commitment of Snow Lake underscores the Pine Ridge’s value and aligns with our vision of advancing high-quality uranium assets in tier-one jurisdictions. “Executing this transaction in partnership with Snow Lake makes strategic sense for Global Uranium and marks a significant milestone as we rapidly advance towards our target of securing over 100MIbs of uranium across our portfolio. This Project has the potential to be a game-changer for Global Uranium. The Exploration Target identified at Pine Ridge highlights the significant opportunity for further development at the Project, and we are now planning for the execution of that alongside Snow Lake.” A new leader in North American carbon-free nuclear energy",
