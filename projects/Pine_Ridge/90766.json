The JVCo will be managed by one Manager.  The initial manager shall be Usuran. DILUTION Dilution due to Default If a party (the Delinquent Member ) has not contributed all or any portion of any additional capital contribution that such party is or was required to contribute (the Default Amount ), then the other party (the Non-Defaulting Member ) may elect to exercise its rights after the occurrence of the default. If the Non-Defaulting Member elects to proceed as follows, the payment by the Non-Defaulting Member of the Default Amount shall be treated as a capital contribution by the Non-Defaulting Member to the JVCo on behalf of the Delinquent Member.  In such case, the Interest of the Delinquent Member shall be reduced by an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to: (i) the Default Dilution Multiple; multiplied by the Default Amount; divided by (ii) the aggregate Contributed Capital of all parties (determined after taking into account the contribution of the Default Amount).  The Interest of the Non-Defaulting Member shall be increased by the reduction in the Interest of the Delinquent Member.  The foregoing adjustments shall be effective as of the date of the default.

Non-Contribution Dilution Multiple means (a) during the period prior to an Affirmative Mining Decision, 1.0, and (b) during the period from and after an Affirmative Mining Decision, 1.5. NON-COMPETE COVENANT If a party voluntarily resigns or relinquishes its interest, the party and its affiliates may not directly or indirectly acquire any interest in property within the Area of Interest (as that term is defined in JVA) for a period 24 months from the date of the resignation of relinquishment.

GOVERNING LAW The JVA is to be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, except for its rules as to conflicts of laws that would apply the laws of another state.
