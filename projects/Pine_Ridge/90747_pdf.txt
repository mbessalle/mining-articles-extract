Pine Ridge Uranium Project - Exploration Target Information
results
An Exploration Target range of 24.4 – 51.3 Mlbs U3O8 at a grade range of 310-400ppm U3O8 for the Pine Ridge Uranium Project was established. The Exploration Target was defined following an
extensive data review including 765 historical holes drilled by Conoco and 449 holes drilled by Stakeholder Energy LLC. Further data reviewed includes the lithological and geophysical logs for all
drill holes, 204 cross sections that correlate stratigraphy through the Stakeholder drill holes, 22 cross sections with geologic interpretations of uranium roll fronts, Stakeholder Arc GIS database,
maps and digitised historical date.
The deposits are epigenetic uranium roll-fronts. Project is located on the western flank of the Powder River structural basin. The uranium deposits are hosted in the Eocene aged Wasatch
Formation and the Paleocene aged Fort Union Formation. The host sandstones generally dip shallowly toward the east-northeast towards the synclinal axis of the basin.
Global Uranium’s Exploration Target Range is conceptual in nature. Insufficient modern exploration has been conducted to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral Resource and it is uncertain
whether future exploration will lead to the estimation of a Mineral Resource in the defined areas.
The Exploration Target Range is an estimate only, in accordance with JORC 2012, and has been estimated based on following parameters assumptions:
• Exploration Target Range is based only on Stakeholder drilling data with formation characteristics being uniform across the Project
• There are 140 miles of redox trend currently exist on the Project with an average mineralized width of 300 ft being applied to the redox trends. This width is an assumption, and the true width will
need to be determined with additional exploration and delineation drilling
• The bulk density of the Project is 16.6 ft3/ton based on public data from the neighbouring Reynolds Ranch Project
• Grade and thickness cut offs of 0.02% U3O8 and 2 feet were applied to mineral intercepts
• The 25th percentile (1st quartile) intercept thickness and grade were 2.9 feet and 0.031% respectively
• An average intercept grade was found to be 0.037%, with an intercept thickness of 4.4 feet
Data Verification and QA/QC efforts include:
• Verified calibration records for the geophysical logging tolls used during Stakeholder’s three phases of drilling. No calibration data are available for previous exploration efforts
• Spot-checked 10% of the mineral intercept table against the geophysical logs
• Cross-checked geophysical logs against the cross sections
• Reviewed the interpretation of the stratigraphic units in correlation cross sections
Next Steps:
Several steps will be taken to test the validity of the Exploration Target and rapidly advance the Project. These steps include:
• Prioritize exploration areas and generate drill targets based on completed data evaluation
• Acquire necessary permits from regulatory agencies
• Initial exploration drilling program this year to generate a resource model targeting up to eight highly prospective areas which historical and recent drilling has indicated substantial potential
to develop a significant resource in the near term
• Evaluation of results and maiden Mineral Resource Estimates (MRE) followed by a Scoping Study

Estimation Method
The upper estimate of Exploration potential was calculated as shown in Equation 1 and the lower estimate was calculated as shown in Equation 2.
A percentile-based analysis of the Stakeholder drilling data was used to estimate the exploration potential to reduce the influence of outliers on the average intercept thickness and grade. Using
the 25th and 75th percentile brackets the average and provides a conservative lower estimate that is below the average of drilling data and an upper estimate that accounts for the limited
objectives of the drilling programs and the higher GT values found when drilling intercepted the noses of roll fronts.
These estimates are preliminary in nature, rely heavily on assumptions and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimate of a mineral resource.

Maybell Uranium Project - Exploration Target Information
results
The Company announced the Exploration Target range of 4.3-13.3 Mlbs U3O8 at a grade range of 587-1,137ppm U3O8 for the Maybell Uranium Project on 14 December 2023. The Exploration Target
was defined following an extensive data review of over 3,000 mineralised historical drill holes which indicated a significant volume of mineralised material remains around the historic open pits.
This current drilling program is designed to test and confirm the mineralisation around the historic open pits and the Exploration Target.
The Exploration Target only incorporates high grade material in the Upper Browns Park Formation, below and around the historic open pits, leaving significant potential for further expansion.
Additional thick, lower grade uranium mineralisation occurs at depth in the Lower Browns Park Formation that is not included in the Exploration Target but has been confirmed by the Company’s
first two holes at Maybell with thick intersections of mineralisation returned in both holes including 30.3m at 130ppm U3O8 in MB-009.
The Exploration Target Range is an estimate only, in accordance with JORC 2012, and has been estimated based on several factors including historical drilling results and the analysis of high and
low range grade intercepts, thicknesses of target horizons and size of mineralised areas.
Global Uranium’s Exploration Target Range is conceptual in nature. Insufficient modern exploration has been conducted to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral Resource and it is uncertain
whether future exploration will lead to the estimation of a Mineral Resource in the defined areas.
The review and interpretation of the extensive drill hole database indicated a significant volume of mineralised material remains around the historic open pits and this has allowed the
development of an Exploration Target Range. These areas fall within the red Exploration Target area shown below in Figures below.

Appendix C
results
The Exploration Target Range is an estimate only in accordance with JORC 2012 and has been estimated based on several factors including historical drilling results including analysis of high and
low range grade intercepts, thicknesses of target horizons and size of mineralised areas. A total of six areas listed in Table below have been used to produce the target range where sufficient data
exists within all of the categories described above. The potential grade and quantity of uranium within each target area is conceptual, however it is based on results and observations from the re-
interpretation of historical drilling data.
The size of the target areas was intentionally limited to the proximal zones around the mined pits and they excluded the mined areas (with the exception where mineralisation clearly remained
beneath the pits). All of these areas have a moderate to high density of drilling and a large percentage of the holes are mineralised. Potential exists outside these six areas, and these will be
considered for inclusion in future updates to the Exploration Target Range as more data becomes available. Global Uranium believes these areas are highly prospective for additional uranium
discovery. The location of each area in the Exploration Target are shown in Figures above and the results are shown in Table below.
The specific parameters used for calculating the Exploration Target Range include:
• The prospective areas were determined from analysis of existing geological data including historical drilling, mining of 5.3 Mlbs over 25-30 years, interpretation of mineralised trends and
evaluation of mineralised drill holes outside of the historic pits.
• Drillholes occurring within the six target areas were identified predominantly from mineralised intervals annotated on historic plans and available electric logs.
• The mineralised intervals were calculated from downhole gamma data using criteria including a minimum thickness = 0.3m. Maximum internal dilution and cutoff grades were variable over
the various plans from which the data was obtained. The plans are the result of work over 25-30 years of exploration and mining.
• The average thickness of all mineralised intervals was calculated. The minimum and maximum thickness were calculated by reducing the average thickness by 15% and increasing the
average thickness by 35%.
• The volume range of mineralised material for each area was calculated by multiplying the area of the targets by the minimum or maximum interpreted intercept thicknesses.
• The estimated tonnage was calculated by multiplying the volume by a density of 2.1 which was documented in historic reports (15 ft3/ton).
• Average grade was calculated across all intercepts in the Target Area. For each intercept grade was multiplied by thickness to give a grade-thickness value (GT). The GT of all intercepts
were then totalled and divided by the total length of mineralisation. The result is the weighted average grade for the drill holes in the Area.
• The minimum and maximum grades of intercepts were calculated by either adding 350pppm or deducting 200 ppm to the average grade. The maximum grade is still less than the
reported head grade during operations.
• All uranium intercepts are reported as U O equivalent basis (eU O ) as historical drilling only used gamma ray instruments to acquire downhole grade data.

The Exploration Target Range is an estimate only in accordance with JORC 2012 and has been estimated based on several factors including historical drilling results including analysis of high and
low range grade intercepts, thicknesses of target horizons and size of mineralised areas. A total of six areas listed in Table below have been used to produce the target range where sufficient data
exists within all of the categories described above. The potential grade and quantity of uranium within each target area is conceptual, however it is based on results and observations from the re-
interpretation of historical drilling data.
The size of the target areas was intentionally limited to the proximal zones around the mined pits and they excluded the mined areas (with the exception where mineralisation clearly remained
beneath the pits). All of these areas have a moderate to high density of drilling and a large percentage of the holes are mineralised. Potential exists outside these six areas, and these will be
considered for inclusion in future updates to the Exploration Target Range as more data becomes available. Global Uranium believes these areas are highly prospective for additional uranium
discovery. The location of each area in the Exploration Target are shown in Figures above and the results are shown in Table below.
The specific parameters used for calculating the Exploration Target Range include:
• The prospective areas were determined from analysis of existing geological data including historical drilling, mining of 5.3 Mlbs over 25-30 years, interpretation of mineralised trends and
evaluation of mineralised drill holes outside of the historic pits.
• Drillholes occurring within the six target areas were identified predominantly from mineralised intervals annotated on historic plans and available electric logs.
• The mineralised intervals were calculated from downhole gamma data using criteria including a minimum thickness = 0.3m. Maximum internal dilution and cutoff grades were variable over
the various plans from which the data was obtained. The plans are the result of work over 25-30 years of exploration and mining.
• The average thickness of all mineralised intervals was calculated. The minimum and maximum thickness were calculated by reducing the average thickness by 15% and increasing the
average thickness by 35%.
• The volume range of mineralised material for each area was calculated by multiplying the area of the targets by the minimum or maximum interpreted intercept thicknesses.
• The estimated tonnage was calculated by multiplying the volume by a density of 2.1 which was documented in historic reports (15 ft3/ton).
• Average grade was calculated across all intercepts in the Target Area. For each intercept grade was multiplied by thickness to give a grade-thickness value (GT). The GT of all intercepts
were then totalled and divided by the total length of mineralisation. The result is the weighted average grade for the drill holes in the Area.
• The minimum and maximum grades of intercepts were calculated by either adding 350pppm or deducting 200 ppm to the average grade. The maximum grade is still less than the
reported head grade during operations.
• All uranium intercepts are reported as U O equivalent basis (eU O ) as historical drilling only used gamma ray instruments to acquire downhole grade data.

number of risks and uncertainties, which are both specific to Global Uranium and of a more general nature, may adversely affect the operating and financial performance or position of Global Uranium which in turn
may affect the value of New Shares and the value of an investment in Global Uranium. There are also risks associated with the Transaction and Equity Raising,includingthosewhicharedescribedbelow. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not an exhaustive list of the risks facing Global Uranium, the Transaction, the Equity Raising or associated with an investment in Global Uranium . Additional risks and uncertainties
may also become important factors that adversely affect Global Uranium’s operating and financial performance or position.
This document is not financial product advice and has been prepared without taking into account your investment objectives or personal circumstances. Before investing in New Shares, you should consider whether
an investment in New Shares is suitable for you. Potential investors should consider publicly available information on Global Uranium, carefully consider their personal circumstances and consult their stockbroker,
solicitor, accountant or other professional adviser before making an investment decision.
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Global Uranium
Operational Safety Global Uranium is subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding occupational health and safety, and the risk of non-compliance with those laws and regulations may
adversely impact Global Uranium’s operations, reputation, financial performance and financial position. All operations and development activities continue to have a strong
focus on safe production and development. However, regardless of how carefully Global Uranium undertakes its operations, mining and exploration operations carry an
inherent risk of liability and as such, these risks cannot be eliminated.
Climate change risk Severe weather events and the challenges posed by climate change are inherently uncertain and have the potential to adversely affect Global Uranium’s operations and
financial performance. While Global Uranium will endeavor to manage these risks and limit any consequential impacts, there can be no guarantee that Global Uranium’s
operations and the value of its shares will not be impacted.
Social and environment The operations and proposed activities of Global Uranium are subject to the laws and regulations concerning the environment and indigenous heritage. Global Uranium’s
relations with local communities and First Nations people in the areas where its assets are located are important to its operations and may be affected by uncertain factors.
It’s Global Uranium’s intention to conduct its activities to the highest standard of environmental and heritage obligations, including complying with all environmental laws or
laws relating to the protection of indigenous heritage. Global Uranium actively engages with all stakeholders on a regular basis to better understand and address the
individual needs of local communities and First Nations people.
However, regardless of how carefully Global Uranium undertakes its operations, both mining and exploration operations carry an inherent risk of liability associated with,
amongst other things damage to natural environment and indigenous heritage. If the compliance costs of such legislation become so significant as to impact Global
Uranium’s costs of carrying on business, this may also have an impact on the future value of Global Uranium’s shares.
Major external events or natural disasters Global Uranium’s projects now or in the future are susceptible to certain physical and other risks, including natural disasters, environmental hazards, pandemics and other
catastrophic events, which could disrupt production and have a material adverse effect on Global Uranium’s financial and operational performance.
Whilst Global Uranium has contingencies and plans in place to ameliorate these risks, such events or natural disasters carry an inherent risk of damage to site infrastructure or
transport/energy related infrastructure and may cause disruption to services and supplies and access to site by employees. These events may significantly impact on Global
Uranium’s operations.

relations with local communities and First Nations people in the areas where its assets are located are important to its operations and may be affected by uncertain factors.
It’s Global Uranium’s intention to conduct its activities to the highest standard of environmental and heritage obligations, including complying with all environmental laws or
laws relating to the protection of indigenous heritage. Global Uranium actively engages with all stakeholders on a regular basis to better understand and address the
individual needs of local communities and First Nations people.
However, regardless of how carefully Global Uranium undertakes its operations, both mining and exploration operations carry an inherent risk of liability associated with,
amongst other things damage to natural environment and indigenous heritage. If the compliance costs of such legislation become so significant as to impact Global
Uranium’s costs of carrying on business, this may also have an impact on the future value of Global Uranium’s shares.
Major external events or natural disasters | Global Uranium’s projects now or in the future are susceptible to certain physical and other risks, including natural disasters, environmental hazards, pandemics and other
catastrophic events, which could disrupt production and have a material adverse effect on Global Uranium’s financial and operational performance.
Whilst Global Uranium has contingencies and plans in place to ameliorate these risks, such events or natural disasters carry an inherent risk of damage to site infrastructure or
transport/energy related infrastructure and may cause disruption to services and supplies and access to site by employees. These events may significantly impact on Global
Uranium’s operations.

Key Risks
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Global Uranium
Pre-development stage Global Uranium has a considerable portfolio of development assets. All projects have inherent delay and cost risks, particularly in the current challenging global market
(geopolitical instability, logistics, inflation, skilled labour availability, etc.).
Whilst Global Uranium is focussed on de-risking the development of these projects, there is no guarantee that such projects meet current expectations or forecasts.
Commodity Prices The prices of commodities, including uranium, are volatile and such volatility may negatively affect Global Uranium’s revenue and cash flows.
Commodity prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond Global Uranium’s control, such as inflation, interest rates and currency exchange. The price of uranium
and the global demand for uranium is also reactive to supply and demand fluctuations. Such fluctuations are influenced by various factors, including the level of consumer
demand, potential distribution problems, technological advances, availability of alternatives, global economic and political developments, forward-selling activities and other
macro-economic factors. Any one of these factors may affect the price of, or demand for, uranium, which in turn may affect the price that Global Uranium is able to obtain for
uranium or the amount of uranium that Global Uranium can sell.
Market changes in uranium industry The growth of Global Uranium’s business, as well Global Uranium’s financial condition and financial performance, are dependent on the continued growth of the uranium
markets generally.
Macro risk General economic conditions may adversely impact Global Uranium’s operating and financial performance and financial position, including its future revenues and share
price. Global Uranium’s operating and financial performance is influenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions, including consumer spending levels,
uranium prices, inflation, interest and exchange rates, supply and demand trends, key customer concentration, industrial disruption, availability of debt and capital markets,
and government fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies.
Geopolitical risk Global and local conflicts, including the tensions between China and Taiwan, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel, could adversely impact Global Uranium’s operations,
financial performance and financial position.
Political risk Global Uranium’s financial performance, operations, share price and profitability may be adversely affected due to circumstances in the countries where Global Uranium
operates, particularly in United States, Canada and Australia.
To conduct its business, Global Uranium must obtain various governmental licenses, permits, authorisations, concessions and other approvals in connection with its activities
in relevant jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Such approvals are related to the laws and regulations that govern prospecting, developing,
mining, production, exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, surface rights, environmental protection, safety and other
matters.
Changes in political, regulatory, or fiscal frameworks in these countries could adversely impact Global Uranium’s financial performance, operations, share price and
profitability.

Key Risks
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Global Uranium
Liquidity risk – debt and capital markets Global Uranium’s operations and development plans may require additional funding or capital for future activities.
There is no certainty that Global Uranium will be able to secure debt, equity funding or alternative means of funding on favourable terms or at all. If Global Uranium is unable to
secure adequate external funding or capital on acceptable terms, or at all, its development and expansion plans may be adversely affected. This may impact the value of
Global Uranium’s shares.
Staffing and key management personnel Global Uranium’s operations, financial performance and financial position are dependent on attracting and retaining qualified key personnel.
Global Uranium relies on the experience, skills and knowledge of its key personnel in United States, Canada and Australia to successfully manage its business. The availability
and retention of skilled personnel is highly competitive in the current market, particularly in United States and Canada with current mining industry growth in certain sectors.
Global Uranium relies heavily on critical executive and senior management level individuals, as well as those with niche technical skills.
The inability to attract and retain key personnel, including personnel with technical skills, or the unexpected loss of such personnel may adversely affect Global Uranium’s
operations, financial performance and financial position.
Fraud, corruption and misconduct Global Uranium’s reputation, business and financial performance may be materially and adversely impacted by fraud or violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
Royalty claims Many of the mining claims of which Global Uranium has an interest are subject to ongoing royalty obligations. The amount of the royalties payable in respect of a claim may
have an impact on the economic viability of that claim, depending on various factors such as commodity prices and prevailing economic conditions. The amount of royalties
payable may impact on profitability of Global Uranium and consequently impact on the value of Global Uranium’s shares.
Resource estimate Resource estimates are expressions of judgement based on knowledge, experience and industry practice. Estimates which were valid when originally calculated may alter
significantly when new information or techniques become available. In addition, by their very nature, resource estimates are imprecise and depend to some extent on
interpretations, which may prove to be inaccurate.
As further information becomes available through additional fieldwork and analysis, the estimates are likely to change. This may result in alterations to development and
mining plans which may, in turn, adversely affect Global Uranium’s operations. This may impact on Global Uranium’s future profitability any consequently the value of Global
Uranium’s shares.
Exploration risk Exploration for mineral resources is highly speculative. There is no assurance that exploration of the tenement portfolio in which Global Uranium has an interest, will result in
the discovery of a mineral deposit let alone one that results in an increase of Global Uranium’s current mineral resource, or the conversion of any of Global Uranium’s mineral
resources to ore reserves. Further, there is no certainty that any of the minerals discovered will be able to be economically recovered. In particular, the success of Global
Uranium’s future exploration activities may be affected by a range of factors including geological conditions, limitations on activities due to seasonal weather patterns,
unanticipated operational and technical difficulties, industrial and environmental accidents, changing government regulations and may other factors beyond the control of
Global Uranium.
Further the exploration costs of Global Uranium are based on certain assumptions with respect to the method and timing of exploration. By their nature, these estimates and
assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and accordingly, the actual costs may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. Global Uranium will need
access to ongoing sources of capital in order to progress its exploration program. Global Uranium’s inability to exploit its exploration assets, may impact on the future value of
Global Uranium’s shares.

Key Risks
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Global Uranium
Land access From time to time, Global Uranium’s tenements, or tenements Global Uranium has legal or beneficial interest in, may be subject to access restrictions. These may relate to the
freehold owner of the land on which the tenements are located, or the rights of indigenous people. In those circumstances, Global Uranium may have to resolve access
arrangements under the relevant regime prior to entering upon the land to carry out activities or developing a mine on the tenements. Access arrangements may be subject
to the provision of monetary compensation, compensation for damage to land, and restoration of the land.
There can be no guarantee that applications or access arrangements will be resolved in a timely fashion, in Global Uranium’s favour, or in a manner that is commercially
viable for Global Uranium. Global Uranium’s inability to resolve access issues on satisfactory terms, may impact its operations, and particularly its exploration program. If
access issues are not resolved satisfactorily, this may impact on the future value of Global Uranium’s shares.
Taxation Changes to corporate income tax, import duties, property tax, excise tax, withholding tax or any other applicable taxation legislation or policies relevant to Global Uranium
may adversely affect Global Uranium’s financial profitability, net assets and cash flow and the returns to investors.
Litigation Legal proceedings may arise from time to time in the course of Global Uranium’s business. Global Uranium may be involved in disputes with other parties which may result in
litigation. Any such claim or dispute, if proven, may impact adversely on Global Uranium’s operations, financial performance and financial position.
Insurance There are significant exploration and operating risks associated with uranium exploration and mining, including adverse weather conditions, environmental risks and fire, all of
which can result in injury to persons as well as damage to or destruction of the plant, equipment, production facilities and other property. Global Uranium is also subject to
environmental risks such as pollution and environmental damage. Should a significant event occur where Global Uranium is not fully insured there could be a negative impact
on Global Uranium. In addition, in the future, some or all of Global Uranium’s insurance coverage may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
Risks relating to Transaction
Transaction may not complete or may be Completion of the Transaction is conditional on various matters including shareholder approval from Global Uranium. Refer to the ASX announcement in relation to the
delayed Transaction and Capital Raisings released by Global Uranium to ASX on the same date as this presentation for further information regarding the material conditions for the
Transaction. There can be no certainty, nor can Global Uranium provide any assurance or guarantee, that these conditions will be satisfied or waived or, if satisfied or waived,
when that will occur.
If for any reason any of the conditions are not satisfied or waived (where capable of being waived) by the time required, completion of the Transaction (Completion) may be
delayed or may not occur on the current terms or at all. Global Uranium will have incurred significant transaction costs in relation to the Transaction even if it does not proceed
and these costs may include a reverse break fee payable by Global Uranium in certain circumstances. There is a risk that the transaction costs associated with the
Transaction (whether it completes or not) results in Global Uranium not achieving the earnings guidance it has previously provided to the market.
There may be other adverse consequences for Global Uranium and Global Uranium shareholders if Completion does not occur, including that the trading price of Global
Uranium’s shares may be materially adversely affected and the other benefits that Global Uranium expects to achieve from the Transaction will not be realised. If Completion
is delayed, Global Uranium may incur additional costs and it may take longer than anticipated to realise the benefits of the Transaction. Any failure to complete or delay in
completing the Transaction could materially and adversely affect the price of Global Uranium’s shares.

Key Risks
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Transaction
Reliance on information provided Global Uranium undertook a due diligence process in respect of the Transaction, which relied in part on legal, financial, taxation, synergies and operational due diligence on
information provided by or on behalf of Stakeholder. If any such information provided to, and relied upon by, Global Uranium in its due diligence, and in its preparation of this
presentation and other materials given to ASX, proves to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading, or if any of those due diligence enquiries failed to identify potential issues,
there is a risk that the actual financial position and performance may be materially different to Global Uranium’s understanding.
There is also a risk that the due diligence conducted has not identified issues that would have been material to the decision to enter into the Transaction, or that certain
potential issues identified as part of Global Uranium’s due diligence may not have been accurately assessed or quantified or are not possible to quantify or for which sufficient
protection is not provided for in the Transaction Agreement. A material adverse issue that was not identified prior to entry into the Transaction (or an issue that later proves to
be more material than first anticipated) could have an adverse impact on the reputation, financial performance or operations of Global Uranium. Due diligence cannot
uncover all potential issues or historical non-compliance, and reliance has, by necessity, been placed by those undertaking due diligence on the accuracy of information and
confirmations provided by Stakeholder and its representatives.
Further, as is usual in undertaking mergers and acquisitions, the due diligence process undertaken identified a number of risks associated with Pine Ridge, which Global
Uranium had to evaluate and manage. Certain risks cannot be avoided or managed appropriately and the mechanisms used to manage these risks included in certain
circumstances the acceptance of the risk as tolerable on commercial grounds such as materiality. There is a risk that the approach taken by Global Uranium may be
insufficient to mitigate the risk, or that the materiality of these risks may have been underestimated or unforeseen or for which there is no contractual protection, and hence
they may have a material adverse impact on Global Uranium’s operations, earnings and financial position.
The information reviewed by Global Uranium included forward looking information. While Global Uranium has been able to review some of the foundations for the forward-
looking information relating to Pine Ridge, forward looking information is inherently unreliable and based on assumptions that may change in the future.
Historical liabilities of Stakeholder If the Transaction completes, Global Uranium may become directly or indirectly exposed to liabilities that Stakeholder may have incurred or is liable for in the past as a result
of prior acts or omissions, including liabilities which were not identified during the due diligence enquiries or which are greater than expected, or for which were accepted as a
tolerable risk. Such liabilities may adversely affect the financial performance or position of Global Uranium after the Transaction.
There is a risk that Global Uranium could be exposed to unexpected liabilities resulting from past non-compliances by Global Uranium with applicable laws or regulations,
which may impact on the financial performance or position of Global Uranium. It may also have other impacts, such as attracting greater scrutiny from regulators or cause
reputational damage.
Foreign exchange risk and foreign The Transaction includes the acquisition of controlling interests in overseas entities that operate in foreign jurisdictions. These entities transact in the local currencies of the

Key Risks
Key Risk Overview
Risks relating to Transaction
Reliance on information provided Global Uranium undertook a due diligence process in respect of the Transaction, which relied in part on legal, financial, taxation, synergies and operational due diligence on
information provided by or on behalf of Stakeholder. If any such information provided to, and relied upon by, Global Uranium in its due diligence, and in its preparation of this
presentation and other materials given to ASX, proves to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading, or if any of those due diligence enquiries failed to identify potential issues,
there is a risk that the actual financial position and performance may be materially different to Global Uranium’s understanding.
There is also a risk that the due diligence conducted has not identified issues that would have been material to the decision to enter into the Transaction, or that certain
potential issues identified as part of Global Uranium’s due diligence may not have been accurately assessed or quantified or are not possible to quantify or for which sufficient
protection is not provided for in the Transaction Agreement. A material adverse issue that was not identified prior to entry into the Transaction (or an issue that later proves to
be more material than first anticipated) could have an adverse impact on the reputation, financial performance or operations of Global Uranium. Due diligence cannot
uncover all potential issues or historical non-compliance, and reliance has, by necessity, been placed by those undertaking due diligence on the accuracy of information and
confirmations provided by Stakeholder and its representatives.
Further, as is usual in undertaking mergers and acquisitions, the due diligence process undertaken identified a number of risks associated with Pine Ridge, which Global
Uranium had to evaluate and manage. Certain risks cannot be avoided or managed appropriately and the mechanisms used to manage these risks included in certain
circumstances the acceptance of the risk as tolerable on commercial grounds such as materiality. There is a risk that the approach taken by Global Uranium may be
insufficient to mitigate the risk, or that the materiality of these risks may have been underestimated or unforeseen or for which there is no contractual protection, and hence
they may have a material adverse impact on Global Uranium’s operations, earnings and financial position.
The information reviewed by Global Uranium included forward looking information. While Global Uranium has been able to review some of the foundations for the forward-
looking information relating to Pine Ridge, forward looking information is inherently unreliable and based on assumptions that may change in the future.
Historical liabilities of Stakeholder If the Transaction completes, Global Uranium may become directly or indirectly exposed to liabilities that Stakeholder may have incurred or is liable for in the past as a result
of prior acts or omissions, including liabilities which were not identified during the due diligence enquiries or which are greater than expected, or for which were accepted as a
tolerable risk. Such liabilities may adversely affect the financial performance or position of Global Uranium after the Transaction.
There is a risk that Global Uranium could be exposed to unexpected liabilities resulting from past non-compliances by Global Uranium with applicable laws or regulations,
which may impact on the financial performance or position of Global Uranium. It may also have other impacts, such as attracting greater scrutiny from regulators or cause
reputational damage.
Foreign exchange risk and foreign The Transaction includes the acquisition of controlling interests in overseas entities that operate in foreign jurisdictions. These entities transact in the local currencies of the
regulations countries in which they are domiciled. The value of a financial asset, liability, commitment or earnings held or transacted in foreign currency may be impacted by changes in
currency exchange rates. |  |
