Global Uranium and Enrichment Limited (ASX: GUE, OTCQB: GUELF) (Global Uranium, GUE or the Company)
is pleased to announce that Powder River Basin LLC (Powder River), a Delaware limited liability company the
subject of a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between Usuran Resources Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Global
Uranium and Snow Lake Exploration (US) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Snow Lake Energy Resources Ltd
trading as Snow Lake Energy (NASDAQ:LITM) (Snow Lake), has executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement for
the acquisition of the Pine Ridge Uranium Project (Pine Ridge or Project) from Stakeholder Energy, LLC (SHE)
(PSA).
The consideration payable by Powder River to acquire a 100% interest in Pine Ridge totals US$22.5 million
(Consideration) payable to SHE over three equal 12-month instalments of US$7.5 million, with completion of
the acquisition to occur after payment of the first instalment. As part of the JV, Global Uranium and Snow Lake
are each responsible for providing 50% of the Consideration and future exploration expenditures. The PSA
requires the JV to commit a minimum of US$10 million in exploration expenditure over the initial three-year
period. The key terms of the PSA and the JV Agreement are set out at the back of this announcement.
Pine Ridge is an advanced uranium project of significant scale with an established Exploration Target range of
24.4 – 51.3 Mlbs U O , at an average grade of 0.031% - 0.040% U O (100% basis). The Project has been
3 8 3 8
significantly de-risked through historic drilling and has an ideal geological foundation to be developed into a
production asset.
The potential quantity and grade of Pine Ridge’s Exploration Target Range is conceptual in nature.
Insufficient modern exploration has been conducted to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral Resource and it
is uncertain whether future exploration will lead to the estimation of a Mineral Resource in the defined
areas.
Commenting on the acquisition and JV, Mr. Andrew Ferrier, Managing Director of GUE said: “We are pleased
to announce the acquisition of the Pine Ridge Uranium Project, an advanced project with significant scale
potential in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Currently, the Basin is dominated by four globally significant
uranium companies and this strategic move positions Global Uranium in the heart of this important uranium
district.
“We are pleased to welcome Snow Lake Energy as a strategic partner, who have recognised the strength of
Global Uranium’s existing portfolio and our value as a partner in the Pine Ridge Project. The commitment of
Snow Lake underscores the Pine Ridge’s value and aligns with our vision of advancing high-quality uranium
assets in tier-one jurisdictions.
“Executing this transaction in partnership with Snow Lake makes strategic sense for Global Uranium and marks
a significant milestone as we rapidly advance towards our target of securing over 100Mlbs of uranium across
our portfolio. This Project has the potential to be a game-changer for Global Uranium. The Exploration Target
identified at Pine Ridge highlights the significant opportunity for further development at the Project, and we
are now planning for the execution of that alongside Snow Lake.”

Pine Ridge Project, Wyoming, U.S.
Project Summary
The Pine Ridge Uranium Project is located in the southwestern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, the premier
U.S. uranium basin. Historically, the Powder River Basin is the most significant area for uranium production in
U.S. primarily via ISR production methods. Wyoming has produced nearly 240 Mlbs U O since 1951.

Figure 1: Location of Pine Ridge Project in Wyoming, U.S.
In-Situ Recovery (ISR) uranium mining offers significant advantages over conventional hard rock mining,
particularly in terms of environmental impact and cost efficiency. ISR requires no large-scale open pits or
underground tunnels, minimizing surface disturbance and eliminating the need for waste rock and tailings
storage. This translates to a much lower environmental footprint, reduced water usage, and streamlined
permitting processes. Additionally, ISR operations typically have lower capital expenditures and operating
costs due to their simpler infrastructure requirements and more efficient extraction methods.
The Project is a district scale exploration package that will target the prolific, uranium-producing sandstones
of the Wasatch and Fort Union formations. Historical and recent drill data indicate that redox fronts and
uranium mineralization reported on neighbouring properties project into, and through, the Project from
several different areas, strongly supporting the potential for expanded exploration.
Wyoming has a favourable regulatory environment as an agreement state where the NRC has relinquished
portions of its regulatory authority to license and regulate byproduct and source materials including uranium
recovery operations.

Location and Surrounding Infrastructure
The Pine Ridge Uranium Project is located in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming which is widely recognised for
its favourable geological characteristics, well-established infrastructure and long history of uranium
production via ISR. ISR offers a cost-effective and environmentally responsible extraction method.
Furthermore, the presence of existing processing facilities provides a clear pathway to production, enhancing
project viability and reducing development lead times.
Neighbouring properties include the Allemand-Ross Project owned by Uranium Energy Corp. (UEC), the
Reynolds Ranch Satellite to Cameco’s Smith Ranch-Highland Mine, and the Lo Herma project owned by GTi
Energy (GTI) are adjacent to the Project. An extensive review of the available Project data indicates that the
redox fronts mapped at the Project are interpreted to extend across the Project boundaries and continue to
the adjacent properties listed above. Thus, the three adjacent properties are appropriate analogs for the
Project.

Pine Ridge Exploration Target
An Exploration Target has been developed for the Project. The potential quantity and grade at the Project is
conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral
Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource. WWC
Engineering (WWC) estimates the Exploration Target as a range which is discussed in further detail below.
Based on the available verifiable data, the Exploration Target for the Project is presented in Table 2.

After completing the extensive drilling, Stakeholder planned a further close-spaced exploration drilling
designed to achieve a NI 43-101/JORC compliant mineral resource estimate. This drilling never commenced
due to the depressed uranium prices of the mid-2010s. The completion of a close-spaced drilling program is
the initial step in the future development. The specific parameters and assumptions used for calculating the
Exploration Target range include:
• Exploration Target is based only on the Stakeholder drilling data with formation characteristics being
uniform across the Project.
• 140 miles of redox trend currently exist on the Project with an average mineralized width of 300 ft
being applied to the redox trends. This width is an assumption, and the true width will need to be
determined with additional exploration and delineation drilling
• Bulk density is 16.6 ft3/ton based on public data from the neighbouring Reynolds Ranch Project.
• Grade and thickness cut offs of 0.02% U O and 2 ft were applied to mineral intercepts.
3 8
• Lower estimate applied the 25th percentile (1st quartile) grade and thickness which were 2.9 ft and
0.031% respectively.
• The upper estimate applied the 75th percentile (3rd quartile) grade and thickness were 4.8 ft and
0.040% respectively.
• An average intercept grade was found to be 0.037%, with an intercept thickness of 4.4 feet.
Further information regarding the Exploration Target is set out in Appendix A of this announcement.
Next Steps and Timeline
Several steps will be taken to test the validity of the Exploration Target and rapidly advance the Project. These
steps include:
• Prioritize exploration areas and generate drill targets based on completed data evaluation.
• Acquire necessary permits from regulatory agencies.
• Initial exploration drilling program this year to generate a resource model targeting up to eight highly
prospective areas which historical and recent drilling has indicated substantial potential to develop a
significant resource in the near term.
• Evaluation of results and maiden Mineral Resource Estimates (MRE) followed by a Scoping Study.

Pine Ridge – Mineral Tenure and Geology
The privately owned surface at the Project is limited to three large scale cattle ranches: the Henry, Patterson,
and Allemand ranches. The current Project holdings include nearly 8,100 hectares (20,000 acres) of surface
access and mineral rights. Surface ownership at the Project consists of approximately 89% private land, 6%
State of Wyoming land and 5% BLM.
Mineral ownership within the current holdings includes approximately 52% federal minerals, controlled
through unpatented mining claims; 44% fee minerals, controlled through private mining leases; and 4% State
of Wyoming mineral rights, controlled by Wyoming mineral leases. The current lease agreements extend until
dates ranging from 2038 – 2041.
The Project lies within the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming. Uranium has been produced from the
Wasatch and Fort Union formations in the PRB for nearly 60 years. The geology of the region has been
extensively studied and is well understood. Underlying the Project area are thick sections of the Paleocene
Fort Union Formation and Eocene Wasatch Formation. These formations generally dip shallowly east-
northeast into the PRB.
Figure 5: Redox fronts of approximately over 140 miles across Pine Ridge.
At the Project, the Wasatch and Fort Union formations contain several laterally continuous carbonaceous
shales and coal seams that can be used as stratigraphic datums across the Project. The eastern portion of the
Project is made up of thick fluvial sandstone intervals interbedded with shale/claystone intervals of the Fort
Union Formation. The western portion of the Project lacks typical marker beds as seen in the eastern part and
it is more difficult to correlate the geology across large regions.

Uranium mineralization in the Project area is typical of Wyoming roll-front sandstone deposits in the PRB. The
formation of roll-front deposits is largely a groundwater process that occurs when uranium-rich, oxygenated
groundwater interacts with a reducing environment in the subsurface and precipitates uranium. These
geochemical interfaces occur at “redox” boundaries between the up-gradient, barren and oxidized conditions
and the downgradient, mineralized sections along generally continuous redox fronts that extend for miles
along strike.
The well-demonstrated, conceptual geological model based on tens of thousands of exploration and
production holes in the PRB indicates that oxidizing groundwater generally moved from south and west to the
north and east with a smaller vertical component moving down gradient through each hydrologically isolated
sand. Redox trends form nearly perpendicularly to groundwater flow. On a regional scale, groundwater
flowing from the south and west form redox trends that tend to be oriented roughly northwest to southeast.
The regional redox trends are recognized to be highly sinuous where considerable uranium resources can
accumulate.
Approximately 225 linear kilometres (140 miles) of redox trends have been identified across 12 separate
stacked fluvial sandstone horizons in the Wasatch and Fort Union formations throughout the currently held
mineral lands in the Project.
Historical Exploration
Historical exploration at and around the Project was conducted by various companies and consisted of drilling
and collecting geophysical logs on over 1,200 holes. Historical geophysical logging measured natural gamma
(gamma), spontaneous potential (SP), and resistivity.
In the late 2000s, Stakeholder assembled the Project and then undertook three regional drilling campaigns
from 2012 through 2014 across an original land position of approximately 70,000 acres. Phase 1 was
completed in 2012 and consisted of 171 drill holes. Phase 2 was completed in 2013 and consisted of 163 drill
holes. Phase 3 was completed in 2014 and consisted of 115 drill holes, for a total of 449 holes. The objective
of the drilling program was to identify and map major redox trends across the entire Project, beginning with
drilling holes every 1,000 feet to form regional transects. All the Stakeholder drillholes were geologically
logged by the well site geologist and were geophysically logged (gamma, SP, and resistivity) by Hawkins CBM
Logging, Inc. from Cody, WY. The geophysical probe was calibrated at the Department of Energy (DOE) test pit
in Casper, WY at least once per drilling phase.
Significant numbers of historical drill holes encountered mineralization, but at insufficient density to estimate
a mineral resource. Stakeholder generally held to their regional exploration program, focused on building a
regional understanding of the Project. They planned but did not complete significant efforts to drill closely
spaced holes to delineate a mineral resource.
Mineralization occurs in multiple horizons that range up to 10m thick and has been found over more than
1,000 feet of vertical section. Data includes approximately 140 miles of redox trends mapped within the
currently-leased lands. Data now available include:
• A drill hole database including 765 historical uranium exploration holes drilled by previous operators
and 449 recent uranium exploration holes by Stakeholder in three phases of drilling;
• 204 cross sections that correlate stratigraphy, note redox conditions in all intercepted sandstones;
and indications of roll front identities and correlations through the Stakeholder drill holes;
• 22 cross sections with geologic interpretations of uranium roll fronts; and
• The Stakeholder ArcGIS database, maps, and digitized historical data.

Agreement, and (iii) cash in the amount of $2,000,000 prior to the third
anniversary of the closing date of the Agreement.
MANAGEMENT The parties will establish a committee (Management Committee) consisting of
COMMITTEE AND four representatives, of which two representatives shall be appointed by Usuran
MANAGER and two representatives shall be appointed by Snow Lake.
The JVCo will be managed by one Manager.
The initial Manager shall be Usuran.
DILUTION Dilution due to Default
If a party (the Delinquent Member) has not contributed all or any portion of any
additional capital contribution that such party is or was required to contribute (the
Default Amount), then the other party (the Non-Defaulting Member) may elect
to exercise its rights after the occurrence of the default.
If the Non-Defaulting Member elects to proceeds as follows, the payment by the
Non-Defaulting Member of the Default Amount shall be treated as a capital
contribution by the Non-Defaulting Member to the Company on behalf of the
Delinquent Member. In such case, the Interest of the Delinquent Member shall be
reduced by an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to: (i) the Default Dilution
Multiple; multiplied by the Default Amount; divided by (ii) the aggregate
Contributed Capital of all parties (determined after taking into account the
contribution of the Default Amount). The Interest of the Non-Defaulting Member
shall be increased by the reduction in the Interest of the Delinquent Member. The
foregoing adjustments shall be effective as of the date of the default.
Default Dilution Multiple means: (a) during the period prior to an affirmative vote
of the Management Committee to undertake mining on any portion of the JVCo’s
properties (Affirmative Mining Decision), 1.5, and (b) during the period from and
after an Affirmative Mining Decision, 2.0.
Dilution due to non-contribution
If a party (the Non-Contributing Member) delivers a notice to the Management
Committee (Non-Contribution Notice), within twenty (20) days after the final vote
adopting a Program and Budget, the Interest of each party shall be adjusted,
effective as of the beginning of the period covered by the Program and Budget, to
equal a fraction, expressed as a percentage:
(a) the numerator of which equals:
(i) the contributed capital of the party as of the beginning of the
period covered by the Program and Budget; plus

Estimation Method
The upper estimate of Exploration potential was calculated as shown in Equation 1 and the lower estimate
was calculated as shown in Equation 2.

Tonnes = 58.2 million tonnes

Tonnes = 35.2 million tonnes

120.5 lbs/ft3 = Bulk density
2204.6 lbs/tonne = Pounds to metric tonne conversion factor
A percentile-based analysis of the Stakeholder drilling data was used to estimate the exploration potential to
reduce the influence of outliers on the average intercept thickness and grade. Using the 25th and 75th
percentile brackets the average and provides a conservative lower estimate that is below the average of
drilling data and an upper estimate that accounts for the limited objectives of the drilling programs and the
higher GT values found when drilling intercepted the noses of roll fronts.
These estimates are preliminary in nature, rely heavily on assumptions and it is uncertain if further exploration
will result in the estimation of a mineral resource.
Data Verification and QA/QC
Data verification and QA/QC efforts include:
• Verified calibration records for the geophysical logging tools used during Stakeholder’s three phases
of drilling. No calibration data are available for previous exploration efforts;
• Spot-checked 10% of the mineral intercept table against the geophysical logs;
• Cross-checked geophysical logs against the cross sections; and
• Reviewed the interpretation of the stratigraphic units in correlation cross sections.
Table 3 presents the 10 highest grade x thickness (GT) mineral intercepts from the Stakeholder drilling
programs.
