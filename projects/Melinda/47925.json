Of the 375 drill holes, approximately 100 intercepted significant uranium mineralization. C2C Metals plans to permit a drill program for 2024 to follow up on the targets identified by PPL as well as expand exploration into the westerly extension of the mineralized trend as identified by airborne radiometric studies not available to PPL in 1980.
