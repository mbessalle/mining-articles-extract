Rimfire expands Scandium 
exposure in Central NSW 
 
Highlights 
 
Rimfire expands its exposure to scandium, with a Buy Option 
Agreement to purchase 100% of Exploration Licence 8666 from 
Javelin Minerals Limited (JAV:ASX) 
 
The licence – located some 50km from (Fifield hamlet) Rimfire’s 
100% owned Fifield & Avondale Scandium Projects – has seen 
historical reconnaissance drilling intersect anomalous scandium 
in single 3-metre composite aircore drill samples of up to 373 ppm 
Sc from 34m depth 
 
Initial mapping and reconnaissance aircore drill program planned 
by end of CY 2024 
 
Rimfire Pacific Mining (ASX: RIM, “Rimfire” or “the Company”) is pleased to 
advise that it has expanded its scandium exposure in central NSW following 
the execution of an Option to Purchase Agreement with Javelin Minerals 
Limited (JAV: ASX) for their Exploration Licence 8666 located approximately 
50km north of Fifield (see figure 1). If Rimfire elects to exercise the Option to 
Purchase, then the exploration licence will become 100% owned by Rimfire 
and will add to Rimfire’s 100% owned project portfolio. 
Commenting on the announcement, Rimfire’s Managing Director Mr 
David Hutton said: “Expanding our exposure to scandium opportunities 
within central NSW is a priority for Rimfire as we work towards building a 
globally significant scandium resource inventory. 
 
 Our geological team has identified Javelin’s exploration licence as an early-
stage scandium target that compliments our existing scandium projects in the 
area. 
 
The new licence contains a number of anomalous scandium drill intercepts 
and untested magnetic anomalies which need to be followed up and we 
look forward to getting on the ground as soon as possible to determine their 
significance.”

Historical reconnaissance drilling by Javelin Resources has intersected anomalous scandium 
along with anomalous cobalt and nickel in several holes with a single 3-metre composite drill 
sample yielding373 ppm Sc (see JAV ASX Announcements dated 26 July 2023 and 31 July 
2023).  
 
Acquisition Terms  
 
Rimfire has executed a Buy Option Agreement with Cobalt Prospecting Pty Ltd, - a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Javelin Minerals Limited (JAV:ASX), for a cost of $30K (cash). The Buy Option 
Agreement gives Rimfire an exclusive option to acquire 100% of Exploration Licence 8666 
(“Javelin Tenement”), which is located approximately 50kms north of Rimfire’s tenements in 
central NSW and appear to contain similar host rocks as those found at Rimfire’s Melrose and 
Murga North scandium deposits at Fifield, NSW (Figure 1).   
 
Rimfire has an exclusive Option Period of 18 months from the date of execution of the Buy Option 
Agreement to exercise purchase (at Rimfire’s sole discretion) of the Javelin Tenement for $125K 
(in cash or shares).  There is a further milestone payment of $300K (payable in shares) within 4 
years of purchase, if Rimfire announces a maiden Indicated Mineral Resource estimate of greater 
than 5,000t of Scandium Oxide (or equivalent) on the Javelin Tenement. During the Buy Option 
period Rimfire will be responsible for meeting the pro-rata minimum expenditure requirements on 
the Javelin Tenement. Any shares issued under this agreement will be subject to 6-month escrow. 
 
At the time of writing, Rimfire and Javelin were completing all necessary ancillary legal 
documentation, and the transaction will still be subject to standard regulatory conditions such as 
Ministerial consent for the transfer of the tenements.
