Management Comment 
Mr Mark English, Managing Director said: 
 
“The Lindsay’s Project fits within our strategy of acquiring near-term gold production 
projects within trucking distance of mills in the Kalgoorlie area.  
 
“This is an exciting opportunity to add to the gold ounces we control in the region. 
It’s another big step in our growth toward sustained production.  
 
“Due Diligence will be undertaken to confirm the total potential of the Lindsay’s 
Project. The intention is to commence mining from the Parrot Feathers gold deposit 
in 2025. 
 
“Ore from the mine graded 1.93g/t Au and produced 6,153 ounces when last 
mined. Mining was abandoned in 2013 because the gold price slumped, going 
down to A$1,295 an ounce. Just 25% of the planned ore from an open pit was 
extracted at that time. The project was never completed.

“The deposit is ripe for near-term mining and we are looking at re-directing our 
mining team to Lindsay’s after completing the Munda Starter Pit. This would afford 
us the opportunity to produce more ounces of gold whilst extensively planning a 
broader main pit at Munda, which is our flagship asset. 
 
“We thank Pasquale Princi, SEER Financial Group, and Chelsea Taylor, CTC 
Geological, who acted as the corporate advisers to the vendors for their efforts in 
reaching a mutually beneficial outcome for all parties.” said Mr English.

The attraction for Auric is the near-term potential for open-pit mining and toll 
treatment and thereby to produce gold and revenue. 
 
The Company will pay The Vendors $100,000 by way of a non-refundable deposit in 
consideration for which, Top Global has granted Auric the exclusive right to 
complete Due Diligence on the project up till 3 April 2025. 
 
Subject to successful completion of Due Diligence, at execution of the Tenement 
Sale Agreement (TSA) Auric will: 
 
• Pay $2,000,0000 (plus GST in cash) to The Vendors, including the $100,000 
deposit. 
 
• Issue shares to the value of $2,000,000 (plus GST in cash) to The Vendors, 
calculated at the 15-day VWAP ending on the day prior to execution of the 
TSA. The shares will be issued subject to shareholder approval at Auric’s 
Annual General Meeting to be held prior to 31 May 2025. The Vendors have 
agreed to enter into voluntary escrow as follows: 
 
• 
Shares to the value of $1,000,000 held in voluntary escrow for 6 months 
from date of issue. 
• 
Shares to the value of $1,000,000 held in voluntary escrow for 12 months 
from date of issue. 
 
• Grant The Vendors a royalty of 3.5% of the Net Smelter Return from the sale of 
gold from the Lindsay’s Project. 
 
The Lindsay’s Project 
 
The area has a long mining history including first gold production in 1897, a mining 
resurgence in the 1930’s and small-scale mining in the late 1980’s.  
 
KalNorth Gold Mines Limited (KalNorth) commenced modern open pit mining at 
Lindsay’s in January 2013 with ore processed at Saracen’s Carosue Dam mill, 70km 
to the east of Lindsay’s. Mining ceased in August that same year following a drop in 
gold price from a high of AUD$1,625 per ounce to as low as AUD$1,295 per ounce. 
At that stage, KalNorth reported that 6,153oz gold was produced from 138,229t 
grading 1.93g/t Au 2. Ore was mostly mined from the Parrot Feathers deposit with a 
small tonnage (1,893t) extracted from the ‘Trial Pit’ (Figure 2). 
 
In 2016, AIM-listed Keras Resources PLC submitted permit applications to 
recommence mining at Lindsay’s based on both open pit and underground 
mining 3. The permit applications were approved that year. One of the aims of Due

Diligence will be to confirm that near-term open pit mining and toll treatment is 
achievable and the timeline to do so. 
 
The Company’s focus has been on mining aspects of the Project but the exploration 
potential in the tenement package may be considerable and a preliminary 
assessment will be made during Due Diligence.
