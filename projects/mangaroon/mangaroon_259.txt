ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 25 March 2025
Further Gold Ground Consolidated at Mangaroon (100%)
HIGHLIGHTS
• Dreadnought has further consolidated ground at Mangaroon by acquiring, subject to Settlement, M09/63,
E09/2195 and L09/27 from an unrelated vendor (key terms shown later in this announcement).
• These tenements complement the existing tenure (Figure 2) and provide additional gold mineralisation with
limited previous drilling but high prospectivity.
• Importantly, M09/63 is a mining lease containing the historical McCarthy Workings which complement our other
5 mining leases and has the potential to generate short term production ounces.
• The historical McCarthy Workings are located within sediments of the Edmund Group and have been described
as saddle reefs and stockworks. There is no record of the amount of historical production. However, rock chips
collected from the mullock heaps have confirmed gold mineralisation with significant results including:
MCRK010: 15.1 g/t Au MCRK007: 3.4 g/t Au
• Drilling is expected to commence this month at several targets on mining leases (Star of Mangaroon, Popeye,
Pritchard’s, Two Peaks and Lead Gold Mine). This program aims to identify and add ounces to production.
Dreadnought Resources Ltd (“Dreadnought”) is pleased to announce it has, subject to
Settlement, acquired tenements strategically located around the 100% owned Mangaroon
Gold Project (“Mangaroon”), in the Gascoyne region of WA.
Dreadnought’s Managing Director, Dean Tuck, commented: “Subject to Settlement, this acquisition has continued to
expand our footprint over highly prospective gold corridors with historical gold occurrences including a sixth mining lease. The
acquisition of this position over the Edmund
Group and major crustal scale structures is
strongly in line with our near-term production
ounces and discovery pillars of the gold strategy
at Mangaroon.
Knowledge gained from exploring McCarthy
Workings will have immediate benefit to
understanding the potential of other regional
analogues at Mangaroon.
We believe that the known high-grade gold
occurrences, areas of historical production with
limited to no drilling, and key lithostructural
settings will deliver compelling targets for
discovery and near-term production ounces.”

M09/63, E09/2195 and L09/27 (100%)
M09/63, E09/2195 and L09/27 immediately adjoin Mangaroon to the SE. The ground is highly prospective for gold
and contains several areas with historical diggings including the McCarthy Workings where there was production but
no records.
The tenements cover ~30km2 of the Edmund Group near Cobra Station which is the location of the original Gascoyne
gold field. The Edmund Group sediments and volcanic sills are edged between the crustal scale Lyons River and
Edmund Faults, the area is also a terminating location of the Minnie Creek Fault.
The McCarthy Workings have been described as saddle reefs and stockworks within a tightly folded anticline within
the Edmund Group Sediments and Narimbunna Dolerite. Rock chips from the mullock heaps returned significant
results including:
MCRK010: 15.1 g/t Au MCRK007: 3.4 g/t Au
Mapping and sampling of the historical workings described that these workings were developed on near vertical axial
plain veins with minor workings on saddle reefs. A handful of holes were drilled, but despite the observation that
mineralisation was in vertical veins, holes were drilled vertically which are considered ineffective. A few angled holes
do not appear to have been
drilled deep enough to test
under any of the old
workings. Further review and
mapping of the historical
work will be undertaken
prior to drill program design.
The McCarthy Workings and
the wider tenement package
are viewed as under explored
having been in control of
prospectors with small scale
operations for the past 30
years.
Mapping and surface sampling
will occur in April 2025 and
an RC drilling program is
planned for June 2025.

Project and gold occurrences.
Details of the Transaction
Key Terms:
• Dreadnought to own 100% of M09/63, E09/2195 and L09/27 upon Settlement.

Snapshot – Mangaroon Gold (100%)
Mangaroon Gold is 100% Owned by Dreadnought
• Mangaroon covers >5,000kms2 with an initial focus on the gold system situated over the Mangaroon Shear Zone
between the crustal scale Minga Bar and Edmund Faults with multiple phases of intrusions. Numerous historical
workings along the Mangaroon Shear Zone have only seen limited, shallow drilling along ~200m of strike near the
Star of Mangaroon mine. This area also contains the ~12km x 6km Bordah and ~50km long High Range prospects
where limited previous exploration has identified outcropping gold and base metal mineralisation.
Self-Funded Explorer Strategy
• Dreadnought’s strategy is to transform into a self-funded explorer. This involves a high-grade open pit at the Star
of Mangaroon where funding, development, haulage & processing are outsourced to third parties. This is a
common model in WA given the robust gold price. Once successful, extend this model to Popeye, Two Peaks,
Lead, Pritchard Well, etc. In this way, there is reduced reliance on market funding and internal cashflows are
aimed at making life-changing discoveries.
Consolidation Provides for First Ever Modern Exploration
• All historical workings and known gold occurrences relate to outcropping mineralisation. There has been minimal
historical and modern exploration due to fractured, small-scale ownership with Dreadnought now undertaking
modern exploration for the first time.
Significant, Step-change, Growth Potential
• Five historical mines developed on outcropping mineralisation and dozens of gold occurrences along highly
prospective structural corridors.
• Dreadnought is deploying modern geochemical and geophysical techniques to explore for mineralisation under
shallow cover. These techniques have already generated new prospects with stronger and larger signatures than
the historical mines, including the region’s largest high-grade producer at the Star of Mangaroon mine.
• Project-wide stream sediment sampling and geophysical surveys have identified additional camp scale prospects
at Bordah and High Range.
Shallow, High-grade Gold
• The initial Resource at Star of Mangaroon contains shallow, high-grade gold as per Table 1 below:

• Also, Popeye, located <1km from the Star of Mangaroon, contains significant shallow high-grade gold including:
POPRC001: 3m @ 22.8 g/t Au from 13m POPRC002: 1m @ 1.6 g/t Au, 15.5g/t Ag from 11m
Exceptional Metallurgical Recoveries
• The region is known for its free gold. Accordingly, metallurgical work at Star of Mangaroon produced exceptional
recoveries from standard gravity and carbon in leach circuits averaging 96.7% combined recovery including an
average 74.4% gravity recovery (ASX 14 Oct 2024).
