# HYCROFT ACQUIRES CLAIMS NEAR HISTORIC ROSEBUD MINE

WINNEMUCCA, Nev., May 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: HYMC) ("Hycroft" or "the Company"), a gold and silver development company that owns the Hycroft Mine in the prolific mining region of Northern Nevada, is pleased to announce the acquisition of claims near the historic past-producing high-grade gold and silver mine, Rosebud.

The patented mining claims known as Lucky Boy 1, Lucky Boy 2, and White Alps were acquired by the Company from Newmont USA Limited ("Newmont") and are part of a 50% undivided interest with Hecla Mining Company ("Hecla").

In addition to the claims, the Company also received a significant amount of data covering over 10,000 acres of land currently owned by Hycroft and adjacent to the known resource area.  The data includes information from approximately 230 drill holes, rock chip samples, soil geochemistry, geophysics, and significant surface mapping.

Alex Davidson, Vice President of Exploration, commented, "Not only do these patented claims improve our land position but the high-quality data acquired with the claims significantly improves our understanding of the Hycroft deposit as well as our targets within the corridor between the Hycroft Mine and the historical Rosebud Mine."

Diane Garrett, President & CEO, commented: "As we progress the Hycroft Mine to its next phase of commercial operations, this acquisition is part of our parallel work to understand and explore the vast land position owned by Hycroft.  The significant amount of data obtained through this transaction on the acquired patented claims and on land we currently own, has been extremely valuable and correlates well with the hyperspectral and fieldwork we have been conducting.  This newly acquired data has allowed us to prioritize many targets within our land position". 

The Rosebud Mine, which operated during 1997 – 2000 through a joint venture between Newmont and Hecla, produced approximately 400,000 ounces of gold and over 2 million ounces of silver at an average grade of over 14 grams and 83 grams per ton, respectively1.  The historical Rosebud Mine is situated within the Company's land position and is the same epithermal system as the Hycroft Mine.   The proximity of this very high-grade mine to the vast mineralized system at the Hycroft Mine gives us confidence in finding higher-grade ore and potential feeder systems.  Mr. Alex Davidson was the mine geologist at Rosebud during his tenure with Hecla.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included herein and public statements by our officers or representatives, that address activities, events or developments that our management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to such things as future business strategy, plans and goals, competitive strengths and expansion and growth of our business. The words "estimate", "plan", "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "believe" "target", "budget", "may", "can", "will", "would", "could", "should", "seeks", or "scheduled to" and similar words or expressions, or negatives of these terms or other variations of these terms or comparable language or any discussion of strategy or intention identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements address activities, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future and are based on current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to (i) risks related to changes in our operations at the Hycroft Mine, including risks associated with the cessation of mining operations at the Hycroft Mine; uncertainties concerning estimates of mineral resources; risks related to a lack of a completed feasibility study; and risks related to our ability to re-establish commercially feasible mining operations; (ii) industry related risks including fluctuations in the price of gold and silver; the commercial success of, and risks related to, our exploration and development activities; uncertainties and risks related to our reliance on contractors and consultants; availability and cost of equipment, supplies, energy, or reagents.  The exploration target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve, as ranges of potential tonnage and grade (or quality) of the exploration target are conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient exploration of the relevant property or properties to estimate a mineral resource; and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource.  These risks may include the following, and the occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances alone or in combination with other events or circumstances may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Please see our "Risk Factors" outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, and other reports filed with the SEC for more information about these and other risks.
