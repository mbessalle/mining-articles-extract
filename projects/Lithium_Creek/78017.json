(TSXV: APX) (OTC Pink: SLMLF)&#160;(\"Apex\" or the \"Company\")  has staked and recorded 176 additional placer mining claims (approximately 3,520 acres, the \"Claims\") in the Carson Sink and Humboldt Sinks, located in Churchill County, Nevada to support ongoing expanded lithium brine exploration at its Lithium Creek Project (the \"Project\"). </p><p>The Claims were located and recorded with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in accordance with state and federal mining regulations following release of favorable analytical results (see Apex News Release <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JgLYPFDVjE\">October 3, 2023</a>) from  shallow groundwater samples recently collected at the Project. </p><p>Laboratory analytical results for nearly half of the brine samples from the latest round of sampling indicate lithium concentrations exceed 50 mg/L, ranging up to 393 mg/L within the Project area. The results provide compelling evidence of the potential for regional large scale lithium enriched brine aquifers or reservoirs to exist at the Project. Encouraging analytical results were used to inform the Company's acquisition of claims on BLM lands adjacent to or near the Project which are expected to have similar geological and hydrogeological characteristics and potential for continuity to the Project's lithium brine discovery. </p><p>Ron Lang, CEO of Apex Resources, commented \"The favorable results of samples showing high concentrations of lithium up to 393 mg/L is very encouraging, and supports our continued exploration for a potential discovery of a new, district-scale lithium brine reservoir(s) in the United States. Nearly doubling our land position was very important to make sure that we have all the targets we desire. Planning is now underway for the next phase of exploration.\"</p><p>Following release of analytical results, the Company has increased the Project's land position from approximately 4,720 acres to 8,240 acres of claims in the Fernley, Carson, and Humboldt Sinks. Acquisition of the additional claims is expected to increase the likelihood of developing the regional lithium brine resource that is expected to exist at the Project. </p><p><b>About Apex Resources Inc.</b></p><p>Apex is a mineral exploration company engaged in the business of the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral resource properties.
