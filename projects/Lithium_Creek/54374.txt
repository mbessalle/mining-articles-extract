Pursuant to the SPA, the Company acquired all of the shares of 1434001 in exchange for a cash payment of USD $80,000.00 and the issuance of 18,000,000 common shares of Apex (the "Payment Shares"). The Payment Shares will be deposited into a TSXV Tier 2 Value Escrow Agreement and released in accordance with the provisions thereof. Upon completion of issuing all Payment Shares, 1434001 which holds an exclusive option to acquire a 100% interest in the Property (the “Option”) will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

[]()Concurrent with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company has closed the non-brokered private placement (the “Financing”) through the issuance of 9,000,000 units (the “Units”) for gross proceeds of $630,000.  Each Unit is comprised of one common share of the Company (an “Apex Share”) and one share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder to purchase an additional Apex Share for a price of $0.12 and expires on May 22, 2026 (the “Expiry Date”). If at any time prior to the Expiry Date, the Company’s common shares trade at or above a price of $0.20 per common share on the TSXV for a period of 10 consecutive trading days commencing four months plus one day after the issue date, the Company may, at its option, accelerate the Expiry Date by issuing a press release announcing such acceleration (the "Acceleration Press Release”), and, in such case, the Expiry Date shall be deemed to be the 30th day following the date of issuance of the Acceleration Press Release. 

[]()All of the Apex Shares issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a four-month and one day hold period from the closing date.
