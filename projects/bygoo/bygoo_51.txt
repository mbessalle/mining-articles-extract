 Significant discovery opportunities throughout the project area and the potential for a large-
scale tin producing region at Bygoo
 Settlement of Tranche 2 Placement raises approximately $421,000 for exploration, including a
maiden drill program scheduled for early 2025
Caspin Resources Limited (Caspin or the Company) (ASX: CPN) is pleased to have exercised its Option and
acquired 100% interest in the Bygoo Tin Project in New South Wales.
Completion of the Bygoo Tin Project Acquisition
On 23 September 2024, Caspin announced it had entered into an option agreement (Option Agreement) with
Syndicate Minerals Pty Ltd (ACN 635 864 587) (Syndicate), pursuant to which Syndicate agreed to grant Caspin an
exclusive option (Option) to acquire 100% of the fully paid ordinary shares in Syndicate’s wholly owned subsidiary,
Riverston Tin Pty Ltd (ACN 164 404 988) (Riverston). Riverston holds a 100% legal and beneficial interest in three
exploration licences comprising the Bygoo Tin Project. Following completion of corporate and technical due
diligence, and shareholder approval at its recent Annual General Meeting, held on 27 November 2024 (AGM), the
Company is pleased to announce it has exercised the Option to acquire 100% of Riverston and the Bygoo Tin Project.
Caspin’s Managing Director, Mr Greg Miles, commented “Since first announcing the Option to acquire the
Bygoo Tin Project, our technical evaluation has revealed many more discovery opportunities than we
originally expected. The latest interrogation of historical data has recognised significant geochemical
anomalism coinciding with basement magnetic features similar to the Ardlethan Mine, with no modern
drilling, presenting a great opportunity for Caspin to make a major new discovery.
“This work has allowed Caspin to define several compelling drill targets and is planning to quickly commence
its maiden drilling program in early 2025. We believe there is excellent potential to return the Bygoo region
back to its former glory of the premier tin producing field on mainland Australia.
“We look forward to commencing drilling activities in the New Year. Our initial program will focus on the Bygoo
North Prospect with future programs across the region as our targeting matures. We believe this will be against
a backdrop of long-term increasing demand and rising prices for tin.”

Large basement geochemical anomalies in the vicinity of the Ardlethan Tin Mine
During the Option Period, the Company diligently reviewed the extensive catalogue of reports detailing
exploration activity across the Bygoo Tin Project and surrounding areas. The majority of work was completed
in the 1970s and 1980s with only minor portions of data from these reports digitised by the NSW Resources
department or 21st Century explorers.
From these hard copy reports (reference list of reports in Table 1), Caspin has georeferenced and digitised over
1,400 basement sample points comprising of Auger, RAB, Aircore (used to penetrate alluvial cover with only one
or two down hole samples, similar to auger) and rock chip assays. Review of these results has identified
multiple basement geochemical anomalies above 50ppm Sn (approximately 5 times background values),
many of which are yet to be tested by basement RC or diamond drilling (Figure 1).

drilling programs, showing coherent anomalies and peak assay results.

The highlight of this developing work is a 2km x 1.5km basement geochemical anomaly located 2.5km to the
east of the Ardlethan Tin Mine. A large basement anomaly, defined by the 50ppm Sn contour, which locally
contains zones of greater than 500ppm Sn, is coincident with a prominent arcuate magnetic high and
intersecting northeast and northwest trending faults. The Ardlethan Mine is clearly defined by a 30ppm Sn
basement contour (Patterson, 1990), providing confidence that the Ardlethan East 50ppm Sn anomalies are a
significant indicator of basement tin mineralisation. The Ardlethan Mine is also associated with similar arcuate
magnetic features and structural intersections as observed at Ardlethan East.
The basement anomaly is almost entirely under shallow cover. A basement RAB sample of 1.86% Sn lies at the
northern extent of the anomaly and remains untested at depth by RC or Diamond drilling. This result is from the
final hole of a RAB drill line and is open to the east, west and north.

structure.

This developing target represents an opportunity of scale to complement the immediate walk-up drill targets at
Bygoo North and South and elsewhere along the Ardlethan Granite margin (Figure 3).
The process of locating, digitising and interpreting historical data is ongoing and may provide further undrilled
targets during this process.

Drilling program to commence in early 2025
With the completion of the acquisition, the Company is now focussed on commencing drilling programs as soon
as possible. Planning is underway for an approximate 1,500m RC program, initially at the Bygoo North Prospect
which has been the focus of most recent exploration with stunning intercepts such as 35m @ 2.10% Sn from
43m (BNRC011) and 35m @ 1.71% Sn from 94m (BNRC085). Many of the greisen lodes remain open, particularly
at depth (refer to ASX announcement of 23 September 2024).
The environmental permitting process has commenced with land access agreements already in place at Bygoo
North. The Adlethan East targets will be scheduled for drill testing later in the summer season following
completion of access agreements and permitting, allowing further refinement of drill targets. The Company
aims to maximise its field work during the summer months, prior to sowing of next seasons crops.
Consideration paid to Syndicate on completion under the Option Agreement
The Company has issued Syndicate the following securities (or its nominee(s)):
(a) 10,000,000 shares at a deemed issue price of $0.05 per share; and
(b) 10,000,000 options to acquire shares, with 5,000,000 options exercisable at $0.08 and 5,000,000 options
exercisable at $0.12, on or before 4 December 2026,
(together the Consideration Securities).
The issue of the Consideration Securities was approved by shareholders at the AGM pursuant to ASX Listing Rule
7.1. The Consideration Securities are subject to a voluntary escrow period of 12 months from the date of issue.
In addition to the Consideration Securities, the Company has entered into a Royalty Deed with Syndicate and
Riverston, pursuant to which Caspin and Riverston have agreed to grant Syndicate a 2% Net Smelter Returns
Royalty (Royalty) in respect of any minerals, mineral products, ore or concentrates produced from the
tenements comprising the Bygoo Tin Project, with Caspin retaining the right to buy back 50% (or 1% of the NSR)
of the Royalty for $1,000,000.
Settlement of Tranche 2 Placement to raise approximately $421,000
The Company received shareholder approval at the AGM to issue of 8,433,586 shares at $0.05 per share to raise
$421,679, being Tranche 2 of the Company’s $1.6m Placement to institutional and sophisticated investors

The Tin Market
Tin is a high value metal, currently trading around US$28,500/t (cf. copper trading around US$8,900/t). It is a
common metal used in everyday applications. Just over 50% of global tin production is used in solder, the
connection material used in circuit boards and other electric components. For this reason, tin is often
considered a ‘technology metal’, increasingly important to support growing demand for electrification and
computing, from solar panels to AI data centres. Understandably, tin is on the US critical minerals list and the
strategic mineral list in Australia.
Tin supply is dominated by China, Indonesia and until recently, Myanmar. Smaller amounts of production come
from other southeast Asian countries as well as central Africa and South America. Due to a glut of supply over
the past 40 years the tin price has stagnated, leading to a severe under-investment in tin exploration in Australia
and across the world.
A large portion of global production has environmental (subsea dredging) and social (artisanal mining, conflict
regions) concerns. Australia contrasts as an attractive destination for tin investment, being a safe first-world
jurisdiction with high environmental and social standards.

output over the
past 20 years

The price of tin has rallied up to 30% in 2024, potentially signalling the recognition of strong demand
fundamentals for tin and the lack of quality new supply options to meet the emerging energy transition
thematic. Caspin is excited to be well positioned to benefit from this promising development.

ABOUT CASPIN:
Caspin Resources Limited (ASX Code: CPN)
is a mineral exploration company based in Perth,
Western Australia, with expertise in early-stage
exploration and development. The Company
currently has three Australian projects offering a
diverse mix of commodities and excellent
opportunity to add value through exploration and
discovery.
• The Company has recently completed the
acquisition of the Bygoo Project in New South
Wales, an advanced, high-grade tin project
located in a prolific tin producing region.
Positioned within the Wagga Tin Granites, a
mineralised belt with many occurrences of tin
and associated metals, the project surrounds
the historic Ardlethan Tin Mine, one of
Australia’s largest producing tin mines on
mainland Australia.
• The Company’s Yarawindah Brook Project
located in the West Yilgarn region of WA, an
exciting new mineral province hosting the Gonneville PGE-Ni-Cu Deposit owned by Chalice Mining Limited only 40km to the
south. Initial drill campaigns at Yarawindah Brook have made discoveries of PGE, nickel and copper sulphide mineralisation.
Further exploration is focussed on prospective near-surface targets with potential for high-grade massive nickel and copper
sulphide.
• Mount Squires is a large scale, greenfield gold, rare earths and base metal project located in the West Musgrave region of
Western Australia. The project is located adjacent to the western border of BHP’s $1.7b West Musgrave mine development
which hosts the large Nebo-Babel Ni-Cu sulphide deposits. The Company has discovered rare earth elements (REE) and
currently has an exclusive option agreement with Australian Strategic Materials allowing them to earn up to 75% of REE
rights, whilst the Company continues its search for nickel and copper.
These projects are strategically positioned, providing excellent exposure to new critical and battery mineral markets.
