COMPETENT PERSONS STATEMENT
The information in this report that relates to Exploration Results is based on information compiled or reviewed by Mr Greg Miles, a Competent Person who is an employee of the company. Mr Miles is a Member of the
Australian Institute of Geoscientists and has sufficient experience of relevance to the styles of mineralisation and the types of deposits under consideration, and to the activities undertaken, to qualify as a Competent
Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Mr Miles consents to the inclusion in this
report of the matters based on information in the form and context in which it appears.
The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the Exploration Results information included in this report from previous Company announcements announced to the
ASX on 23 September 2024.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some statements in this report regarding estimates or future events are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements preceded by words such as “planned”,
“expected”, “projected”, “estimated”, “may”, “scheduled”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “potential”, “could”, “nominal”, “conceptual” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements, opinions and
estimates included in this announcement are based on assumptions and contingencies which are subject to change without notice, as are statements about market and industry trends, which are based on
interpretations of current market conditions. Forward-looking statements are provided as a general guide only and should not be relied on as a guarantee of future performance. Forward-looking statements may be
affected by a range of variables that could cause actual results to differ from estimated resultsexpressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to
liabilities inherent in exploration and development activities, geological, mining, processing and technical problems, the inability to obtain exploration and mine licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals
required in connection with operations, competition for among other things, capital, undeveloped lands and skilled personnel; incorrect assessments of prospectivity and the value of acquisitions; the inability to
identify further mineralisation at the Company’s tenements, changes in commodity prices and exchange rates; currency and interest rate fluctuations; various events which could disrupt exploration and development
activities, operations and/or the transportation of mineral products, including labour stoppages and severe weather conditions; the demand for and availability of transportation services; the ability to secure adequate
financing and management's ability to anticipate and manage the foregoing factors and risks and various other risks set out in the Prospectus and in this presentation. There can be no assurance that forward-looking
statements will prove to be correct.
Statements regarding plans with respect to the Company’s mineral properties may contain forward looking statements. Statements in relation to future matters can only be made where the Company has a reasonable
basis for making those statements.

Bygoo Tin Project – Leveraged to Escalating Demand
Strong commodity fundamentals
• Tin is a high-value metal, currently trading ~US$31,700/t
• Tin listed as a ‘Strategic Metal’ in Australia and importantly a
‘Critical Metal’ in the US, due to a lack of domestic supply
• Approximately 50% of the tin market is consumed as solder with
very little recycling
• Growing demand in semiconductors, plus new energy transition
technologies such as batteries, solar cells and connectors,
hydrogen generators and fuel cells

Bygoo Project Overview
In the heart of the Wagga Tin Granite Belt, NSW
• Three granted exploration licenses covering 1,180km2
• Surrounds the old Ardlethan tin mine (excised), which was the
largest tin mine on mainland Australia, producing 48kt Sn until 1986
 Recent drilling has intersected high-grade tin mineralisation (>1% Sn)
at shallow depths, unknown to historical miners
 Geology and drilling to date indicates a classic granite-roof hosted vein
greisen system – different to the Ardlethan breccia system
• Large legacy database and historical workings identifies numerous
prospects, with the most advanced at Bygoo North

Excellent Regional Potential
A full pipeline of greenfield to advanced prospects
• Over 20km of eastern Ardlethan Granite
contact to explore
 Historical workings indicate numerous tin
occurrences along the contact
• Example: Bald Hill Prospect
 Last drilled in 1979
 Significant Sn intersected in ‘alluvials’
 Appears to be derived from underlying
weathered greisen but limited testing
• Confirmed greisen at nearby Maratholi
historical workings
 9m @ 0.49% Sn from 26m (BHRC001)
• Large gaps in drill and soil geochemistry
coverage between prospects, most
exploration focused on historic workings
• Almost no exploration along the western
contact of Ardlethan Granite

Highly Encouraging Mineralogy
Key to Economic Processing
• Petrology performed on several thin
sections from BNRC011: 35m @ 2.10% Sn
(Main Zone)
• Tin occurs as Cassiterite (SnO ) amongst
2
dominantly quartz and lesser tourmaline
and topaz
Cassiterite is the only tin mineral that
can be economically processed, usually
through gravity separation
• Relatively coarse crystal sizes averaging
0.5mm, up to 3mm
• Very rare sulphide minerals, therefore good
potential for clean concentrates

What is a Greisen?
A common host of tin mineralisation and associated metals
• Greisen is a highly altered granitic rock,
usually composed predominantly of quartz
and micas, formed by hydrothermal fluids
from the host granite. Common accessory
minerals are topaz and tourmaline.
• They typically occur in the roof zone of
prospective granites as veins or large
irregular volumes.

Caspin’s Investment Proposition
• The Bygoo Project is an excellent opportunity to add value through exploration and discovery
 Recognition of high-grade tin mineralisation systems in a forgotten, but prolific tin region
 Limited exploration over the past four decades provides many pathways for success
• Rare exposure to the tin market at an inflection point between supply and demand
• Expands Caspin’s exposure to critical and strategic metals, complementing our other projects
• Exploration to continue at Mount Squires & Yarawindah Brook
