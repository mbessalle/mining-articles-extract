Caspin Resources Limited (Caspin or the Company) (ASX: CPN) is pleased to announce it has executed an Option
Agreement to acquire 100% of the Bygoo Tin Project in New South Wales. The agreement has been reached with
Syndicate Minerals Pty Ltd (Syndicate), a private company generating exploration project opportunities across Australia.
Caspin’s Managing Director, Mr Greg Miles, commented “The Bygoo Tin Project is a compelling advanced
exploration story that is relatively unique on the ASX. We’re excited by the high grades of tin intersected in previous
drilling, close to surface, and on the doorstep of the largest historic tin mine on mainland Australia. Combined with
an expanded exploration tenure, Caspin has an excellent opportunity to grow this into one of the most significant
modern tin projects in the country.
“This is a fantastic opportunity for Caspin to diversify its base metal exposure into a commodity that is undergoing
its most significant structural change in decades. Caspin has the exploration and development expertise to drive
this project forward and recognise its value in this escalating market.
“We thank our new and existing shareholders for their support of our placement and look forward to rewarding
them with further insights into the Bygoo Project over the coming months.”

The Bygoo Project – An
Emerging Tin Exploration
Story
The Bygoo Project comprises
three granted leases near
the township of Ardlethan in
the Riverina District of New
South Wales. The project
covers an area of 1,180km2
and surrounds the historic
Ardlethan Tin Mine (excised
from the package) which
produced approximately
48,000t of tin from 1912 to
19861. The mine was the
most prolific producer of tin
on the Australian mainland
until operator Aberfoyle
Limited was forced to close
the mine during the collapse
of the tin market during the
mid-80’s. There was
subsequently a complete
absence of exploration in the
Bygoo area for 30 years up
until 2015. This has created
an exciting modern
exploration opportunity.
Historical exploration during 1960s and 70s was predominantly focussed on shallow extensions of breccia-style
mineralisation from the Ardlethan Mine. However, more recent exploration since 2015 has recognised high-
grade greisen-style mineralisation, a hydrothermal alteration of granite. Most of the older exploration involved
shallow, vertical drill holes that failed to intersect the often steeply dipping greisen mineralisation.
Best results have been returned from the Bygoo North Prospect, approximately 7km north of Ardlethan, where
at least five separate greisens have been recognised over a strike of approximately 500m. There are numerous
historical workings and shallow pits indicating widespread tin mineralisation. Most of the early drilling in this
area has been ineffective.
Bygoo North is characterised by relatively high-grade mineralisation that compares favourably to other hard
rock tin projects in Australia. Examples of recent high-grade drill intersections include:
 35m @ 2.10% Sn from 43m, including 5m @6.00% Sn from 65m (BNRC011)
 35m @ 1.71% Sn from 94m, including 6m @ 5.04% Sn from 106m (BNRC085)
 26m @ 1.27% Sn from 140m, including 7m @ 2.88% Sn from 146m (BNRC073)
 12m @ 1.92% Sn from 77m, including 3m @ 5.20% Sn from 84m (BNRC020)
 18m @ 1.35% Sn from 58m, including 6m @ 2.27% Sn from 65m (BNRC063)
 15m @ 1.42% Sn from 120m, including 3m @ 3.44% Sn from 125m (BNRC013)
A full table of BNRC series (2015 to present day) results can be found in Appendix A.
The tin greisens are open in multiple directions, with many obvious target areas to extend mineralisation.

Importantly, petrographic studies have shown that tin mineralisation occurs as cassiterite, a tin oxide (SnO ),
2
and often the only primary tin mineral that can be economically processed. No other sulphide minerals are
recognised as accessory to cassiterite, indicating good potential for clean concentrates. No metallurgy studies
have been undertaken to date but would form an important milestone of Caspin’s future work programs.
Regional Potential
Beyond Bygoo North, the entire Ardlethan Granite contact is prospective for greisen-style mineralisation,
striking over 20km on its eastern margin. This eastern contact has been the focus of most historic exploration
and prospecting with hundreds of small workings and diggings, indicating extensive tin occurrences.
Some recent exploration has demonstrated the potential for further significant discoveries of tin mineralisation
across the project area. For example, drilling at the Bald Hill Prospect, at the southern end of the Ardlethan
Granite and 17km south of Bygoo North, returned significant tin results from only three holes drilled:
 9m @ 0.49% Sn from 26m, including 1m @ 1.42% Sn from 28m (BHRC001)
 20m @ 0.30% Sn from 26m, including 1m @ 1.61% Sn from 20m (BHRC002)
 17m @ 0.16% Sn from 23m (BHRC003)
No further work has been conducted at Bald Hill since these holes were completed in 2018.
3

The western contact of the Ardlethan Granite has had very little exploration of any kind, in part because of
separate tenement ownership, which has only been consolidated in recent times. Drilling along the western
margin has been very sparse and represents an almost entirely new search space for Caspin to explore.
The Bygoo Project is within a large, mineralised belt, known as the Wagga Tin Granites, with many occurrences
of tin and associated metals. The Company has additional tenure covering the belt south of Ardlethan with
recognised tin occurrences and again, limited exploration, which will form part of the Company’s longer-term
plans.
4

Next Steps
The Company will use a 3-month option period to compile all available datasets to prioritise drill targets. There
is additional historical drilling in the order of 100 to 150 holes currently not reported (typically from the 1970’s),
to be consolidated into the drill database. An assessment of geophysical datasets will also be undertaken, given
the apparent strong structural control on greisen mineralisation, which may potentially be recognised through
high resolution magnetics.
Field reconnaissance will commence in the coming weeks.
$1.6m Placement to Advance Exploration
The Company is pleased to announce that it has received firm commitments from existing and new strategic,
institutional and sophisticated investors for a capital raising of $1,600,000 (before costs), to be completed via
the issue of 32,000,000 new fully paid ordinary shares in Caspin (“New Shares”) at $0.05 per New Share
(“Placement”).
Combined with the Company’s current cash, the funds raised under the Placement will be used to fund
exploration at the Bygoo Tin Project, along with working capital and the costs of the Bygoo acquisition.
5

The capital raise will be completed via the issue of
32,000,000 new fully paid ordinary shares via a two-
tranche placement. The Company will utilise its
existing placement capacity under ASX Listing Rules
7.1 (14,139,848 shares) and 7.1A (9,426,566 shares) for
the issue of a total of 23,566,414 shares in Tranche 1,
with the balance of 8,433,586 shares to be issued under
a second Tranche subject to shareholder approval at
the Company’s Annual General Meeting, anticipated to
be held in mid to late November.
Directors of the Company have committed to invest
$100,000 (2,000,000 shares) as part of Tranche 2 of the
Placement, subject to shareholder approval.
The Placement issue price of A$0.05 per share
represents a 13.8% discount to the Company’s last
traded price on 18 September 2024 (A$0.058) and a
6.5% discount to the Company’s 30-day VWAP of
$0.0535.
The Company expects the Tranche 1 Placement Shares
to be issued on Monday, 30 September 2024. The
Placement Shares will rank equally with the existing
fully paid ordinary shares on issue.
Discovery Capital Partners Pty Ltd (“Discovery Capital”) acted as Lead Manager and Broker to the Placement.
Discovery Capital will receive 1,000,000 unlisted options (exercisable at $0.10 and expiring 3 years from date of
issue) (subject to shareholder approval).
Key Agreement Terms
The Company has secured an exclusive 3-month option to acquire 100% of the shares of Riverston Tin Pty Ltd,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Syndicate Minerals Pty Ltd.
The consideration payable by the Company to Syndicate is as follows:
1. An option fee of $100,000 on signing, providing Caspin with 3 months exclusivity;

The Tin Market
Tin is a high value metal, currently trading around US$31,700/t (cf. copper trading around US$9,200/t). It is a
common metal used in everyday applications. Just over 50% of global tin production is used in solder, the
connection material used in circuit boards and other electric components. For this reason, tin is often
considered a ‘technology metal’, increasingly important to support growing demand for electrification and
computing, from solar panels to AI data centres. Understandably, tin is on the US critical minerals list and the
strategic mineral list in Australia.
Tin supply is dominated by China, Indonesia and until recently, Myanmar. Smaller amounts of production come
from other southeast Asian countries as well as central Africa and South America. Due to a glut of supply over
the past 40 years the tin price has stagnated, leading to a severe under-investment in tin exploration in Australia
and across the world.
A large portion of global production has environmental (subsea dredging) and social (artisanal mining, conflict
regions) concerns. Australia contrasts as an attractive destination for tin investment, being a safe first-world
jurisdiction with high environmental and social standards.
Decline in tin
output over the
past 20 years

The price of tin has rallied over 30% in 2024, potentially signalling the recognition of strong demand
fundamentals for tin and the lack of quality new supply options to meet the emerging energy transition
thematic. Caspin is excited to be well positioned to benefit from this promising development.
