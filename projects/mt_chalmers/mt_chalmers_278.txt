Overview 
QMines Limited (ASX:QML) (QMines or Company) is pleased to announce the acquisition of a new strategic tenement 
(EPM 29043) over the Striker prospect. Striker is a sought-after target that now forms part of the Company’s ﬂagship 
Mt Chalmers copper and gold project, located 17km north-east of Rockhampton, Queensland (Figure 1).  
Previously unavailable, the tenement hosts robust multi-element soil geochemical anomalies detected during a 
regional survey conducted by Geopeko Limited (Geopeko) in the 1970’s1. To test these anomalies, Geopeko drilled 
four holes, two ending in mineralisation and two ending above the mineralised horizon. The mineralised horizon is an 
intensely pyritic rhyolite tuff below a strong alteration zone. 
The QMines 2023 VTEM geophysical survey identiﬁed an excellent chargeability anomaly coincident with this 
target2. The Company believes this Striker target contains all of the inputs required for a Mt Chalmers style deposit.

16 SEPTEMBER 2024 
New Striker tenement acquisition consolidates district scale package; 
Tenement covers highly ranked VTEM anomaly with robust Cu-Pb-Zn soil anomaly; 
Limited historical drilling ended in mineralisation including: 
• 18m @ 0.88% Zn including 6m @ 1.63% Zn, 0.56% Pb & 11 g/t Ag; 
• 45m @ 0.48% Zn: and 
• 45m @ 0.43% Zn; 
Striker geological setting similar to the Mt Chalmers deposit.

“We have been waiting for this strategic tenement to become available for some time as it hosts intense sulphide 
mineralisation, with favourable geology and strong geochemical and geophysical support. There is a clear case for 
drilling this target now that the tenement has been granted.”

Tenement Acquisition 
QMines applied for 33 sub blocks to close a notable window within its Mt Chalmers tenement holdings. EPM 29043 
was granted to Rocky Copper Pty Ltd (100% owned subsidiary) on 9 September 2024 for a minimum period of 5 years. 
 
This area was previously covered by an existing tenement held by a local landowner, who undertook limited work. 
There is also evidence of small scale alluvial mining in the area. 
 
Local Geology 
The area of interest comprises NW-SE striking and west dipping felsic volcanics and interbedded marine 
sedimentary rocks including pyritic black shales of the Chalmers Formation. These units have been intruded by 
andesitic and dolerite sills and dykes. The geology is the same at Mt Chalmers and is considered a prime Volcanic 
Hosted Massive Sulphide (VHMS) exploration setting. Figure 2 shows the geology of the southern part of the 
tenement area. The northern part is covered by recent alluvium. 
Near the top of the sequence a major alteration zone appears to have partly replaced a rhyolite tuff unit. The zone 
comprises an intensely altered, variably pyritic and gossanous muscovite-sericite-chlorite zone. This zone is 
 
 
3 
recessive except where siliciﬁed, and one siliceous part of this zone forms a high central hill. Local small rich gossans 
within the alteration zone comprises Fe-Mn rich cellular boxworks and appear to be stringer zones rather than 
massive gossan.  
Along strike, abandoned workings were identiﬁed by Geopeko (Figure 2) but no additional data is available.

Figure 3: Section A-A’ historical drilling. 
Historic Drilling 
Geopeko drilled four percussion holes in 1981 to test soil Cu-Zn geochemical anomalies. A cross section is shown in 
Figure 3. Signiﬁcant intercepts were: 
• 
18m @ 0.88% Zn from 115m including 6m @ 1.63% Zn, 0.56% Pb and 11g/t Ag in hole H18 PDH2; 
• 
45m @ 0.43% Zn from 102m in hole H18 PD3; and 
• 
45m @ 0.48% Zn from 6m in hole H18 PDH4. 
Drillholes PDH2 and 3 intersected and terminated in highly altered rhyolitic tuff containing several percent sulphides. 
This appears to be a separate alteration zone to the main alteration zone described above. All four holes were 
terminated before either closing the mineralisation or before reaching mineralisation due to excessive groundwater 
inﬂows. 
Geophysics 
The initial QMines VTEM airborne survey did not detect any notable anomaly within the new tenement area. 
Subsequent modelling to remove IP effects from the data has located a highly ranked anomaly, marked by the oval 
boundary on the various ﬁgures. This anomaly is a single peak, narrow to moderate width, strike extensive early to 
late time response. It correlates with strong chargeability, resistivity and magnetic anomalies, as well as the 
mineralisation zone and its geochemical response. Figure 4 reveals these features.

Figure 4: Geophysical summary.  
Geochemistry 
Regional soil geochemical testing by Geopeko in the late 1970’s identiﬁed strong Cu, Pb and Zn anomalies coincident 
with the mapped alteration zones, as well as along strike to the northwest. Figure 5 shows signiﬁcant Cu and Zn 
values above 250ppm (pink symbols) which deﬁne these anomalies.

Next Steps 
Following the granting of the tenement, the Company now plans to complete reconnaissance work with a ﬁrst pass 
drilling program to follow. Deeper and additional drilling is required to properly test the robust northwest-trending 
alteration and mineralisation zones in the search for Mt Chalmers VHMS-style deposits there.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 Mt Warminster Mineral Resources 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, 
random chips, or specific specialised industry 
standard measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as down hole 
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken as limiting the 
broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure 
sample 
representivity 
and 
the 
appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems 
used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that 
are Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been 
done this would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse 
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples 
from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases, more 
explanation may be required, such as where there is 
coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. 
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information. 
• 
QMINES has not yet drilled at EPM 29043. The limited 
information in this table refers to historical drilling by 
Geopeko in 1980. Geopeko drilled 4 percussion holes for a 
total 615 metres. 
• 
The 1980 samples were collected at 3m intervals. No 
information on sample collection was found but it is likely 
that Geopeko, a reputable company, maintained best 
practice for that time.  
• 
No QAQC data is available. 
  
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole 
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) 
and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard 
tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or 
other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what 
method, etc). 
• 
Percussion drilling was likely completed by the Mount 
Morgan Ingersoll-Rand Crawlair rig with an auxiliary 
compressor. 
 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Drill 
sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip 
sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and 
ensure representative nature of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade and whether sample bias may 
have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of 
fine/coarse material. 
• 
No information has been located however Geopeko was 
a leading mineral explorer so drilling methods were likely 
consistent with or better than industry practices at the 
time. 
• 
Water inflows caused some holes to be stopped short of 
their planned depth. It is likely that at least some samples 
were damp and/or wet. It is unknown how much this 
affected sample quality. 
• 
The samples should not be relied upon for resource 
estimation, however they are still usable for the purposes 
of early-stage exploration. 
Logging 
• 
Whether core 
and 
chip samples have 
been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of 
detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation, 
mining 
studies 
and 
metallurgical 
studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in 
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged. 
• 
All drilling was logged by Company geologists onto paper 
logs and then typed. Drill logs are unavailable on open file 
and drilling results have been retrieved from submitted 
cross sections. 
• 
Geological information consists of lithology descriptions, 
alteration, mineralisation, veining, weathering etc. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and 
sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, 
half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, 
etc and whether sampled wet or dry. 
• 
For all sample types, the nature, quality and 
appropriateness 
of 
the

technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples.

Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is 
representative of the in-situ material collected, 
including 
for 
instance 
results 
for 
field 
• 
Details on the sub-sampling techniques are not available. 
• 
Sample quality is unknown. These results should be 
viewed with caution and treated as being indicative of 
mineralisation.

checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy 
(i.e. lack of bias) and precision have been established. 
• 
Geopeko samples were typically dispatched to the Mt 
Morgan site laboratory for analysis. 
• 
All samples were analysed for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, S and Ba. 
• 
The assaying technique was not recorded but is deemed 
to be acceptable for the purposes of early-stage 
exploration. 
• 
No QAQC procedures were in place at the time. For the 
purposes of early-stage exploration, this is unlikely to be 
an issue. 
Verification of

• 
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves 
unbiased sampling of possible structures and the 
extent to which this is known, considering the deposit 
type. 
• 
If the relationship between the drilling orientation 
and the orientation of key mineralised structures is 
considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if material. 
• 
The target dips on average at 60 degrees towards the 
southwest. All drillholes were inclined at 60 degrees 
towards 098 degrees AGM which is oblique to dip 
azimuth 
by 
approximately 
45 
degrees.

Historic data taken from Geopeko reports is fit for 
exploration purposes. 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of 
mineralisation. 
• 
The Striker prospect, like the nearby Mt Chalmers deposit, is 
situated in the early Permian Berserker Beds, which occur 
in the fault-bounded Berserker Graben, a structure 120 km 
long and up to 15 km wide. The graben is juxtaposed along 
its eastern margin with the Tungamull Fault and in the 
west, with the Parkhurst Fault.  
• 
The Berserker Beds consist mainly of acid to intermediate 
volcanics, tuffaceous sandstone and mudstone (Kirkegaard 
and Murray 1970). The strata are generally flat lying, but

locally folded. Most common are rhyolitic and andesitic 
lavas, ignimbrites or ash flow tuffs with numerous breccia 
zones. 
Rocks 
of 
the 
Berserker 
Beds 
are 
weakly 
metamorphosed and, for the most part, have not been 
subjected to major tectonic disturbance, except for normal 
faults that are interpreted to have developed during and 
after basin formation.  
• 
Late Permian to early Triassic gabbroic and dioritic 
intrusions occur parallel to the Parkhurst Fault. Smaller 
dolerite sills and dykes are common throughout the region 
and the Berserker Beds.  
• 
Researchers 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
Mt 
Chalmers 
mineralization is a well-preserved, volcanic-hosted massive-
sulphide (“VHMS – Kuroko style”) mineralized system 
containing zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver. Mineral 
deposits 
of 
this 
type 
are 
syngenetic 
and 
formed 
contemporaneously on, or in close proximity to, the sea floor 
during the deposition of the host-rock units deposited from 
hydrothermal fumaroles, direct chemical sediments or 
replacements 
(massive 
sulphides), 
together 
with 
disseminated and stringer zones within these host rocks.  
• 
At Striker, mineralised tuffs and alteration zones host 
disseminated base metal sulphides and pyrite.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In 
reporting 
Exploration 
Results, 
weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum 
grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and 
cut-off grades are usually Material and should be 
stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short 
lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of 
low grade results, the procedure used for such 
aggregation should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should be shown in 
detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal 
equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
• 
In reported exploration results, no weighted averaging has 
been applied as all sample intervals are equally 3m. 
• 
No top cuts have been considered in reporting of grade 
results, nor was it deemed necessary for the reporting of 
significant intersections.  
• 
No metal equivalents ae used in this release. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisatio
n widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to 
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be 
reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are 
reported, there should be a clear statement to this 
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
Geopeko drillholes were oriented at 60/098 degrees GDA, 
toward an existing mine grid east. The average dip and 
strike of the bedded volcanics and target mineralisation is 
60/235 degrees GDA. This creates an apparent downhole 
width of 110% of true thickness.  
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and 
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any 
significant discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole 
collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Maps, sections, mineralized intersections, plans and drill 
collar locations are included in the body of the relevant 
announcement. 
 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration 
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of 
both low and high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced 
to 
avoid 
misleading 
reporting 
of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
In the body of the announcement  
 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, 
should be reported including (but not limited to): 
geological observations; geophysical survey results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, 
groundwater, 
geotechnical 
and 
rock 
characteristics; 
potential 
deleterious 
or 
contaminating substances. 
• 
Geopeko completed soil geochemical sampling in the late 
1970’s and Striker was a site of anomalous Cu and Zn values.  
• 
The same area as EPM 29043 was covered by EPM 25045 
until recently. No data is currently available. 
• 
Data from QMines’ 2023 VTEMTM survey has been 
reprocessed 
by 
Emergo/Mire 
Geophysics 
and 
has 
highlighted the Striker prospect as anomalous and which 
may be explained by massive sulphides. 
• 
No other exploration data is considered meaningful at this 
stage. 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. 
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or 
large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible 
extensions, 
including 
the 
main 
geological 
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided 
this information is not commercially sensitive. 
• 
The current level of work is considered early stage. 
• 
The scale of anomalism has yet to be defined. 
• 
Initial drill programs are likely to be wide spaced to define 
the mineralised footprint and search for massive sulphides 
and potential sulfide stringer zones.
