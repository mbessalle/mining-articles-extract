# North Bay Resources Inc. Acquires a 70% Interest in the Bishop Gold Mill, Inyo County, California

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **CMC Metals Ltd. (TSX-V: CMB) (Frankfurt: ZM5P) (“CMC” or the “Company”)** is pleased to announce it has entered into a share purchase agreement with North Bay Resources Inc. (OTC-US: NBRI, “NBRI”) to acquire an additional 14.5% of the Bishop Gold Mill (the “**Mill** ”). This brings NBRI’s total ownership to 70%. The remaining 30 % of the mill will be owned by 1436132 B.C. Ltd, a privately held corporation.

The 96 ton per day mill is located north of Bishop, California. NBRI has recently acquired and installed additional gold extraction equipment including a centrifuge in the gravity circuit (_see NBRI press release dated January 10, 2025_). Based on a December 2024 metallurgical study (_see NBRI press release dated December 16, 2024_) NBRI has estimated a 97% recovery of gold from their Fran Gold Project at the Bishop mill. NBRI has estimated material from the Fran Gold Project to have a head grade of 0.9 ounces of gold per ton. Material from the Fran Project has been recently transported to the Bishop mill for test processing.

The Company has entered into an agreement with NBRI and the current minority owner 1436132 BC Ltd., a private Canadian company, for NBRI to acquire an additional 14.5% of 0877887 BC Ltd. (“087”), a former subsidiary of the Company. The primary asset of 087 is the Bishop Gold Mill. Within this transaction, North Bay acquires a total interest of 70% of 087, in addition to prior payments and issuances to date, by assuming the amended cash payments and common share transfers to CMC as follows:

**Cash Payments*** :

  * $12,500 payable on signing
  * $12,500 payable on February 15, 2025
  * $12,500 payable on April 1, 2025
  * $50,000 payable on July 7, 2025
  * $25,000 payable August 15, 2025
  * $50,000 payable September 25, 2025  




(*all cash payments are in USD)

**Share Payment** :

  * $200,000 CAD in common shares of North Bay to be delivered on signing at a foreign exchange rate CAD/USD of $0.70 and share price of $0.0009 totaling 155,555,556 Restricted Common Shares of NBRI subject to a minimum hold period of 1 year and representing approximately 2% of NBRI common shares outstanding.  




Kevin Brewer, President and CEO of CMC notes “We are very pleased to have completed this transaction. This is generating further value from the divesting of the Bishop Mill that we expect will provide us with a significant return in the foreseeable future. We look forward to NBRI’s continued success with this project.”

As a result of this final arrangement between the parties, upon completion of the cash and share payments CMC will no longer hold a security interest in the Mill. After this acquisition, CMC will hold a total of 1,275,555,556 common shares of NBRI. NBRI remains the Operator of the Mill.
