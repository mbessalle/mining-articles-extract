The 96 ton per day mill is located north of Bishop, California.

(TSXV: CMB) (“CMC”), and the current minority owner 1436132 BC Ltd., a private Canadian company, to acquire an additional 14.5% of 0877887 BC Ltd. (“087”) for a total interest of 70%. The primary asset of 087 is the Bishop Gold Mill. Within this transaction, North Bay acquires a total interest of 70% of 087, in addition to prior payments and issuances to date, by assuming the amended cash payments and common share transfers to CMC as follows:
