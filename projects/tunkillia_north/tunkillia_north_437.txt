Cautionary Statement - Reporting of Historical Drilling 
The historical results included in this release include exploration results collected between 
approximately 1995 - 2019. Whilst not all referenced in this release, exploration activity on ground 
covered by the current tenements was undertaken by: 
Equinox Minerals NL, 1994 – 2004, MIM Exploration 1995 – 2003, Minotaur Exploration 1997 – 
2008, Range River Gold 2003 – 2005, Southern Gold, 2004 – 2009 and Doray Minerals, 2009 – 
2019. 
As per ASX requirements, Sipa notes that all of the drill results were reported under the 1989 
version of the JORC code, and are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; a 
competent person has not done sufficient work to disclose the corresponding exploration results 
in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; it is possible that following further evaluation and/or 
exploration work that the confidence in the prior reported exploration results may be reduced 
when reported under the JORC Code 2012; that nothing has come to the attention of Sipa that 
questions the accuracy or reliability of the former owner’s exploration results, but Sipa is in the 
process of independently validating the previous owner’s exploration results and therefore is not 
to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results.  
Sipa will continue to review and validate the data to enable the results to be reported in accordance 
with the JORC Code 2012. This work is to be undertaken in 2025 and will be funded out of existing 
cash reserves. 
The levels of gold reported, from past activities, are a key factor in guiding Sipa’s exploration 
strategy. The previous activity, which produced these results, involved multiple rounds of calcrete 
sampling, aircore drilling and RC drilling.  
The results are considered to have been generated from work programs representing usual 
industry practice for the time they were collected and analysed at commercial laboratories which 
services the mineral exploration industry. In the professional opinion of the Competent Person, 
Sipa has, however, done sufficient verification of the data, to provide sufficient confidence that 
drilling, sampling and assays were performed to adequate industry standards and is fit for the 
purpose of planning exploration programs and generating targets for further investigation.  
The Competent Person has confirmed that the information in the market announcement is an 
accurate representation of the available data. 
The announcement is not otherwise misleading.

The highly prospective and advanced gold exploration projects held by these entities are located 
in the central Gawler Craton in South Australia and in the eastern goldfields of the Yilgarn Craton, 
close to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia (Figure 1).  
The Tunkillia North Gold Project (“Tunkillia North”), the Nuckulla Hill Gold Project (“Nuckulla Hill”), 
and the Skye Gold Project (“Skye”) and the Crown Gold Project (“Crown Gold”) in WA are all 
considered prospective for gold.  
Tunkillia North and Nuckulla Hill host multiple advanced and large-scale gold prospects adjacent 
to, and immediately along strike from, Barton Gold’s 1.5Moz Tunkillia gold project, for which a 
positive scoping study was completed earlier this year (see ASX: BGD, 16/7/24 and 4/3/24). 
Tunkillia North contains a 5km x 5km gold-in-calcrete anomaly generated by MIM during the 
1990’s (see Appendix 1 & see Open File Envelope no. 9862 EL 2518 / 3107 / 4197 Lake Harris West 
Annual Reports and Second Partial relinquishment for the period 25/05/1998 to 02/11/2013 – 
submitted by MIM Exploration) located 10km north along strike from the Tunkillia deposit. To the 
south of Tunkillia, historical drilling by Equinox Minerals Limited at Nuckulla Hill returned gold 
intersections at Sheoak (best 7m @ 4.4g/t Au g/t) and Bimba (best 24m @ 1.1g/t Au) and in drilling 
directly south of the Tunkillia deposit (see Appendix 1 & Open File Envelope no. 9020 – EL 2035 
and EL 2761 Nuckulla Hill – Equinox Annual Reports for the period 6/12/94 to 18/10/2002). 
Skye is along strike from Barton Gold’s Golf Bore gold resource and less than 5km from high grade 
intersections generated by Marmota Limited (see ASX:MEU 26/11/24) at Aurora Tank, and HMS 
discoveries in the region made by Petratherm Ltd (ASX:PTR). 
In WA, Crown Gold is 40km east of Kalgoorlie and 2km from Blackcat’s (ASX:BC8’s) planned East 
Kalgoorlie gold processing plant. 
The South Australian tenements are 100% owned by Gawler Craton (SA) Pty Ltd and the West 
Australian tenements are 100% owned by Crown Gold (WA) Pty Ltd. Both of these entities are to 
be acquired 100% by Sipa. Tenement details are listed in the table below:

Nuckulla Hill Project – South Australia 
The Nuckulla Hill Gold Project is located 10km southwest of Lake Everard and approximately 
500km northwest of Adelaide in South Australia. The Project comprises one granted exploration 
licence (EL 6288) and covers an area of 465km2 located west of the Gawler Ranges in the central 
Gawler Craton.  
The Project lies 40km to the south of Barton Gold’s Tunkillia gold project, which hosts a number of 
gold deposits with a global JORC Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 1.5Moz Au (51.3Mt @ 0.91 
19 December 2024

ASX: SRI 
g/t Au) (see ASX:BGD 4/3/24). The Tunkillia 
deposits are related to the Yarlbrinda Shear, 
a crustal-scale deformation zone within the 
Gawler Craton.  
Nuckulla Hill is also located along the 
Yarlbrinda Shear Zone.  
The Project contains a number of advanced 
gold prospects requiring follow up work, 
including Sheoak, Bimba and Myall. 
All prospects have had only limited drilling. 
Sheoak Prospect 
The Sheoak Prospect is over 800m in strike 
length and remains open to the north and 
south, as well as below 120m depth. 
The Prospect was originally identified using 
calcrete sampling in the 1990’s by Equinox 
Minerals (see Appendix 1 & see Open File 
Envelope no. 9020 – EL 2035 and EL 2761 
Nuckulla Hill – Equinox Annual Reports for the period 6/12/94 to 18/10/2002 for details of this 
anomalism and drilling results) which identified gold anomalism.  
Equinox tested the gold anomaly with first-pass aircore drilling which returned +1g/t intercepts 
including 7m @ 4.4g/t Au (See Table 3). 
The Company believes that there is good potential for extensions along the strike of the shear zone 
and at depth, which will be the initial focus of exploration.  
Bimba Prospect 
Bimba is over 300m long and remains open along strike and is unexplored below 120m. The 
prospect was also identified by Equinox with shallow aircore drilling, and then follow up RC drilling 
identifying mineralisation down to at least 120m depth. Better RC results included 24m at 1.1g/t 
Au, and 10m at 1.1g/t Au (see Table 3).

Tunkillia North Project – South Australia 
The Tunkillia North Gold Project is situated 20km west of Lake Everard, approximately 560km 
northwest of Adelaide in South Australia. 
The Project comprises one granted exploration licence (EL 6493) and covers an area of 119km2 
located west of the Gawler Ranges in the central Gawler Craton of South Australia. The Project lies 
to the north of Barton Gold’s Tunkillia Gold Project. 
The Tunkillia North project has a similar 5km x 5km gold-in-calcrete geochemical anomaly, to 
Bartons Tunkillia project, generated by MIM during the 1990’s (see Appendix 1 & Open File 
Envelope no. 9862 EL 2518 / 3107 / 4197 Lake Harris West Annual Reports and Second Partial 
relinquishment for the period 25/05/1998 to 02/11/2013 – submitted by MIM Exploration).  
 
Figure 4: Tunkillia North Historical Gold in Calcrete Geochemistry 
(See appendix 1, and Open File Envelope no. 9862 EL 2518 / 3107 / 4197 Lake Harris West Annual Reports and Second Partial relinquishment for the 
period 25/05/1998 to 02/11/2013 – submitted by MIM Exploration) 
The Tunkillia North gold in calcrete anomaly has not been effectively drill tested, with only one 
ineffective line of aircore drilling by MIM and represents a highly prospective gold target, given its 
location within the Yarlbrinda Shear Zone and along strike from Tunkillia. 
19 December 2024 
 
Page 12 of 25 
sipa.com.au 
ASX: SRI 
Given the size and magnitude of the gold in calcrete anomalism, lack of drilling to date, similar 
geology to nearby deposits, and a possible analogue to the immediate south, exploration at 
Tunkillia North will be prioritised within Sipa’s portfolio. 
Skye Project – South Australia 
The Skye Gold Project comprises one granted exploration licence (EL 6492) and covers an area of 
155km2 located in the central Gawler Craton of South Australia, approximately 700km northwest 
of Adelaide.  
The project is 40km from Barton Gold’s Challenger gold mine which has produced approximately 
1.2 Moz of gold between 2002 and 2018 and is currently under care and maintenance (see 
https://bartongold.com.au/projects/challenger/). 
Skye sits within a proven gold-
bearing terrain. In addition to 
being close to the Challenger 
deposit, it is also adjacent to 
Marmota Limited’s Aurora Tank 
deposit and is only 1.5 km along 
strike from Barton Gold’s Golf 
Bore deposit which has a current 
JORC 
Compliant 
resource 
of 
119koz Au (3.8Mt @ 1.0g/t Au) (see 
ASX: TYX 30/5/2018). 
This structural and geochemical 
corridor narrows or pinches where 
northeast trending, but widens or 
swells 
where 
east-northeast 
trending.  
Work will focus on the laterally 
continuous structural corridor that extends from the Challenger discovery past Golf Bore and Golf 
North into the Skye Gold Project area. 
The Skye Project has a 1% royalty to Meeka Metals Limited.

Crown Gold Project – Western Australia 
The Crown Gold Project is located 50 km to the southeast of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia within 
the Eastern Gold Fields. The project comprises one granted exploration licence (E25/535), three 
granted prospecting licences (P25/2420, P25/2419 and P25/2418), and one pending prospecting 
licence application (P25/2417).  
The project sits between Black Cat Syndicate Limited’s Majestic, Fingals and Trojan gold projects 
and 2km from Black Cat’s proposed gold mill and mines adjacent to the Majestic deposit.  
The Project contains a portion of the Norseman-Wiluna Archean Greenstone belt and is located in 
the Mount Monger part of the greenstone belt covering a proportion of the Mount Monger felsic

dome, and the western contact 
between this felsic dome and the 
overlying bimodal volcanic sequence 
of greenstones.  
The geological setting is similar to the 
Majestic 
deposit 
discovered 
by 
Integra Mining Limited in the 2000’s 
situated around 2km along strike. 
The project is considered to have the 
potential to host a range of different 
styles given the proximity to multiple 
different gold deposit styles in the 
surrounding 
area 
with 
similar 
geology. 
Historical soil sampling by number of 
different explorers delineated multiple gold anomalies, which has received very little follow up 
work.  
The Company aims to test a number of targets, with likely work to involve aircore drilling following 
up the previously identified gold anomalism, with a view to delineating targets for deeper RC 
drilling. 
 
Forward Plans for the New Projects 
Sipa plans to undertake significant on-ground and desktop work across the new projects. The initial 
priority will be given to Nuckulla Hill and Tunkillia North.  
Initial work plans will involve, but not be limited to: 
Nuckulla Hill 
• 
Data review and targeting 
• 
Additional calcrete geochemical sampling 
• 
Heritage surveys 
• 
Extensional aircore drilling along strike of existing prospects

About Sipa 
Sipa Resources Limited (ASX: SRI) is an Australian-based exploration company focused on the 
discovery of precious, base and specialty metal deposits, primarily in Western Australia.  
• 
The Paterson Project is targeting intrusion-related copper-gold mineralisation 
concealed by more recent cover sediments and is located to the northeast of Rio Tinto’s 
Winu copper-gold discovery. 
• 
The Skeleton Rocks Project covers outcropping and buried greenstone units, 
prospective for gold, lithium and nickel-copper-platinum group element (Ni-Cu-PGE) 
deposits, with limited previous drilling completed.  
• 
The Barbwire Terrace base metal (lead-zinc) project, where exploration to date has 
achieved ‘proof of concept’ status, which involved an innovative joint venture with 
energy company, Buru Energy Limited. 
• 
At Wolfe Basin, extensive sedex-style base metal (copper-lead-zinc) anomalism and 
gossans provide targets for drill testing along a >80km long prospective horizon. 
• 
The Warralong Project is prospective for intrusion-related gold and lithium-tin-
tantalum mineralisation in the north Pilbara region, in an analogous, parallel structural 
setting to recent discoveries such as Hemi.

APPENDIX 1 
JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 
Disclaimer 
Sipa Resources has completed a compilation of past exploration work conducted on the tenement 
portfolio. Past reports on work completed have been collated and (where available) digital data 
has been consolidated into a project database. 
The primary objective in compiling the data was to collect evidence that supported the underlying 
exploration rationale for the tenement acquisitions.  
The results are considered to have been generated from work programs representing usual 
industry practice for the time they were collected and analysed at commercial laboratories which 
services the mineral exploration industry. However, for much of the work in the historical reports 
there is only limited information that address specific Table 1 criteria. 
In the professional opinion of the Competent Person, Sipa has, however, done sufficient 
verification of the data, to provide sufficient confidence that drilling, sampling and assays were 
performed to adequate industry standards and is fit for the purpose of planning exploration 
programs and generating targets for further investigation. The Competent Person has completed 
checks of the original reports and found Sipa’s compilation to be a comprehensive and accurate 
capture of the available data. 
Given the individual reports (referenced in the following pages), the following Table 1 sections 
provide overview comments and readers are encouraged to check the freely available source 
documents for any specific details they may require.

widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole 
length, true width not known’). 
• Intercept lengths are downhole 
lengths 
• Not known 
• Downhole lengths, true width not

Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• Refer to maps included in this 
report 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results.
