DISCLAIMER
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT - REPORTING OF HISTORICAL DRILLING
The historical results included in this release include exploration results collected between approximately 1995 - 2019. Whilst not all referenced in this release, 
exploration activity on ground covered by the current tenements was undertaken by:
Equinox Minerals NL, 1994 – 2004, MIM Exploration 1995 – 2003, Minotaur Exploration 1997 – 2008, Range River Gold 2003 – 2005, Southern Gold, 2004 – 2009 
and Doray Minerals, 2009 – 2019.
As per ASX requirements, Sipa notes that all of the drill results were reported under the 1989 version of the JORC code, and are not reported in accordance with 
the JORC Code 2012; a competent person has not done sufficient work to disclose the corresponding exploration results in accordance with the JORC Code 
2012; it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior reported exploration results may be reduced when 
reported under the JORC Code 2012; that nothing has come to the attention of Sipa that questions the accuracy or reliability of the former owner’s exploration 
results, but Sipa is in the process of independently validating the previous owner’s exploration results and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting 
or endorsing those results. 
Sipa will continue to review and validate the data to enable the results to be reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012. This work is to be undertaken in 
2025 and will be funded out of existing cash reserves.
The levels of gold reported, from past activities, are a key factor in guiding Sipa’s exploration strategy. The previous activity, which produced these results, 
involved multiple rounds of calcrete sampling, aircore drilling and RC drilling. 
The results are considered to have been generated from work programs representing usual industry practice for the time they were collected and analysed at 
commercial laboratories which services the mineral exploration industry. In the professional opinion of the Competent Person, Sipa has, however, done sufficient 
verification of the data, to provide sufficient confidence that drilling, sampling and assays were performed to adequate industry standards and is fit for the 
purpose of planning exploration programs and generating targets for further investigation. 
The Competent Person has confirmed that the information in the market announcement is an accurate representation of the available data.
The announcement is not otherwise misleading.
Highly prospective areas
Multiple gold targets to drill
Binding Heads of Agreements to acquire a 100% interest in four advanced gold 
exploration projects in South Australia and Western Australia:
⚬Tunkillia North, Nuckulla Hill & Skye Projects (SA) covering c.729km2, and 
⚬Crown Project (WA), covering c.30km2
• All projects are proximal to million-ounce gold deposits and mining infrastructure 
• South Australian tenements adjacent to 1.5Moz Tunkillia gold deposit and close to 
Challenger gold mill
• Following transaction completion, Stephen Biggins, former Core Lithium Limited 
(ASX:CXO) MD, who oversaw CXO from discovery to a $2B mining company, will 
become Sipa’s largest shareholder and join the Sipa Board
SUMMARY
The new projects are highly prospective, in 
proven geological terrains and proximal to 
nearby infrastructure. 
Their acquisition enables Sipa to 
significantly ramp up our exploration efforts 
and diversify Sipa’s existing portfolio and 
enable year-round on-ground activity. 
Furthermore, the South Australian tenements 
are situated close to the large Tunkillia gold 
deposit (1.5Moz resource) and the 
Challenger gold operation which may 
provide future synergies.
The WA tenements are proximal to 
significant historical mining infrastructure as 
well as new developing projects
Tunkillia North and Nuckulla Hill in South Australia are proximal to Barton Gold’s 
1.5Moz gold Tunkillia project, which has a positive scoping study1
Nuckulla Hill, multiple +1g/t intercepts including:
• 7m @ 4.4g/t Au – Sheoak2 
• 24m at 1.1g/t Au, & 10m at 1.1g/t Au – Bimba2
• Key prospects open along strike and at depth
Tunkillia North
• 5km by 5km gold in calcrete anomaly2
• Requires drilling
Skye Gold & REE Project, situated within a proven gold-bearing terrain:
• 40km from Barton’s Challenger gold mine which produced 1.2Moz gold from 
2002 to 20183
• Adjacent to Marmota Limited’s high-grade Aurora Tank project
• 1.5km along strike from Barton’s 119koz Golf Bore deposit4
Crown Gold Project – WA
• 40km southeast of Kalgoorlie and between Black Cat Syndicate Limited’s Majestic, 
Fingals and Trojan projects and 2km from Black Cat’s proposed gold mill and 
mines at the Majestic Centre
Building shareholder value 
through exploration of 
large-scale gold targets, 
balanced with developing 
advanced, lower-risk gold 
projects adjacent to mining 
infrastructure

Nuckulla Hill Project - SA
HIGH PRIORITY FOCUS – REGIONAL AND EXTENSIONAL TARGETS 
• 40km to the south of Barton Gold’s Tunkillia Gold Project 
• Nuckulla Hill contains ~30km strike of the Yarlbrinda Shear Zone
The Yarlbrinda Shear has a strong association with Tunkillia and is a 
major fluid pathway for gold mineralisation
• In the 1990’s Equinox undertook calcrete sampling with follow up 
aircore and limited rounds of RC drilling discovering gold 
mineralisation at multiple prospects including:
Sheoak, Bimba and Myall. 
Large alteration halo’s identified at each prospect  
• More work required to test along strike on the Yarlbrinda Shear Zone

(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Sipa Resources has completed a compilation of past exploration work conducted on the tenement portfolio. Past reports on work completed have been collated 
and (where available) digital data has been consolidated into a project database.
The primary objective in compiling the data was to collect evidence that supported the underlying exploration rationale for the tenement acquisitions. 
The results are considered to have been generated from work programs representing usual industry practice for the time they were collected and analysed at 
commercial laboratories which services the mineral exploration industry. However, for much of the work in the historical reports there is only limited information 
that address specific Table 1 criteria.
In the professional opinion of the Competent Person, Sipa has, however, done sufficient verification of the data, to provide sufficient confidence that drilling, 
sampling and assays were performed to adequate industry standards and is fit for the purpose of planning exploration programs and generating targets for further 
investigation. The Competent Person has completed checks of the original reports and found Sipa’s compilation to be a comprehensive and accurate capture of 
the available data.
Given the individual reports (referenced below), the following Table 1 sections provide overview comments and readers are encouraged to check the freely 
available source documents for any specific details they may require.

•
Equinox Minerals NL, 1994 - 2004 completed surface sampling, and several rounds of RAB, Aircore 
and diamond drilling over the project.
•
Southern Gold, 2004 – 2009 undertook a PACE funded aircore program, 
•
Doray Minerals, 2009 -2019 completed calcrete sampling and shallow regolith drilling
Geology
•
Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.
•
The company is targeting Shear-hosted lode-style mineralisation within Mesoproterozoic Gawler 
Range volcanics and associated with the Yarlbrinda shear zone
Drillhole Information
•
A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drill holes:
o
easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o
elevation or RL of the drill hole collar
o
dip and azimuth of the hole
o
down hole length and interception depth
o
hole length.
•
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from 
the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
•
Refer to list of drillhole intercepts, Table 1: Material Historical Results
Data aggregation methods
•
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g., cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
•
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
•
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values.
•
Assays have been length weighted for calculation of intercepts, no top cut has been applied
•
Lower cut is 0.2g/t
Relationship between 
mineralisation widths and 
intercept lengths
•
These relationships are important in the reporting of Exploration Results.
•
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
•
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, 
true width not known’).
•
Intercept lengths are downhole lengths
•
Not known
•
Downhole lengths, true width not known
Diagrams
•
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
•
Refer to maps included in this report
Balanced reporting
•
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades 
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
•
See main body text and tables.
Other substantive 
exploration data
•
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.
•
More detailed geological review will follow in subsequent report
Further work
•
The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g., tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
•
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, 
provided this information is not commercially sensitive.
