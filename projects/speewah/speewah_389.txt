Speewah Nth Gold Copper and Antimony 
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• Tambourah obtains shareholder approval to acquire interest in Speewah Nth 
Project1. 
• Tambourah has identified critical minerals (As-Sb-F) and precious metal (Ag-
Au-Cu) potential for follow up drill testing during the upcoming field season. 
• Historic surface sampling including up to 5% Sb in rock chips2 and up to 39% 
Cu, 335g/t Ag has been identified in rock chips at the Chapman prospect. 
 
Tambourah Metals Ltd (ASX:TMB) is conducting a desktop review of historic exploration data for the 
Speewah Nth project (E80/5889), located 110km southwest of Kununurra, Western Australia (see 
Figure 2). The Speewah Dome is recognised as a critical minerals province, host to the Speewah 
Fluorite Project. Tambourah believes that the potential for critical mineral occurrences within the 
Speewah Nth project (E80/5889) has not been adequately assessed due to changes in commodity 
demand and exploration priorities over  time.   
The objective of Tambourah’s review is to identify drill targets with potential to deliver significant 
intersections of critical minerals, particularly antimony (Sb), as part of the hydrothermal polymetallic 
suite recognised within the Speewah Nth Project.   
Background 
The Speewah Dome was explored and mapped intermittently between the early 1900’s and 1949. 
Systematic exploration for base metals, uranium and heavy minerals was carried out between 1968 
and 1971, followed by early identification and definition of the Speewah fluorite deposit. Drilling and 
evaluation of this deposit has continued in several phases, up to recent times.  
A comprehensive exploration programs completed in the Speewah Dome identified numerous 
structures hosting polymetallic mineralisation in quartz veining and breccias. Rock sampling of vein 
sets with textures characteristic of epithermal style mineralisation have reported elevated assays of 
Ag-As-Au-Cu-Sb and this style of mineralisation was targeted extensively for Cu-Au mineralisation 
between 2009 and 2019. There was no exploration for antimony (Sb) at Speewah Nth. 
Exploration History 
The main phase of regional exploration between 2009 and 2019 included airborne 
electromagnetic (VTEM) surveying, surface sampling, subaudio magnetic (SAM), ground 
magnetic and gravity surveys, induced polarisation (IP) surveys and RC and diamond drilling. 
This work identified structurally controlled, hydrothermal vein and breccia-related base metal

and gold mineralisation at the Catto, Chapman, Calomondah East, Eiffler, Grey’s Vein, and 
Hayden’s prospects within E80/5889 (see Figures 1, 3 and 4). 
 
Figure 1: Prospect Location Map and interpreted major structures in purple (from King River Copper 
ASX announcement dated 4th October 2013). 
 
 These prospects cover an area of 6.1km by 4.7km and consist of two main styles of 
mineralised structures 
• Sub-horizontal quartz veining at the granophyre-sediment contact and haematite-
quartz breccia within the granophyre at Catto, Chapman, Grey’s Vein, Hayden’s and 
Martin’s prospects. 
• The Eiffler prospect appears to be related to steeply-dipping regional faults of the 
Central Zone, near the intersection with the northeast striking Pentacost Fault. 
Eiffler’s prospect reports fluorite in association with Au, Cu and Pb.  
High grade antimony results have been reported from surface sampling at the Calomondah 
East, Catto West and Chapman’s prospects (see Tambourah’s ASX announcement dated 13th 
January 2025). Antimony is frequently associated with mesothermal – epithermal vein-hosted 
base metal and gold mineralisation but has hitherto been regarded as an accessory to priority 
Cu-Au exploration targets. For example, initial rock sample assays reported from Hayden’s 
and Chapman’s prospects reported strongly elevated copper, gold and silver results with 
accompanying locally high antimony (see Table 1 Historic surface rock chip sample assay 
results): 
• 5g/t Au, 8.1% Cu and 24oz/t (737ppm) Ag at Hayden’s Prospect3 
• 3.96g/t Au, 39% Cu and 335ppm Ag at the Chapman Prospect4

These and other significant assay results from surface sampling provided evidence of a large-
scale hydrothermal system, prompting follow up RC drilling targeting Cu-Au in flat-lying 
brecciated quartz veins at the upper contact of the granophyre with Speewah Group 
sediments and further work to identify potential structural controls on the zones of 
enrichment.

Speewah Dome Geology 
The Speewah Dome forms a north northeast trending doubly plunging anticline, 
approximately 32km long and 13km wide. The dome comprises sediments of the 
Palaeoproterozoic Speewah Group intruded by the Hart Dolerite, a sill-like layered mafic 
intrusion. The core of the dome contains mafic units of the Hart Dolerite, while the margin 
includes feldspar-rich granophyres, interpreted as a late stage magmatic differentiate of the 
layered sill. The Speewah Nth Project tenement E80/5889 covers an area of 181 sq. km over 
the northern half and eastern margin of the Speewah Dome.  Polymetallic mineralisation 
associated with quartz veining, shale and felsic granophyre has been reported from multiple

sites within E80/5889, including the Chapman, Catto, Haydens, Grey’s Vein, Martin’s, Eiffler 
and Calamondah East prospects. 
The Speewah Dome is constrained by major northeast trending faults (the King River and 
Pentecost Faults) and numerous secondary faults having a north-south or north northeast 
south southwest orientation traverse the interior of the dome. Several styles of mineralisation 
have been recognised within these structures. 
• Massive and disseminated fluorite veins with accessory base metals. 
• Laminated quartz-feldspar veins (epithermal textures). 
• Carbonate veins and carbonate-cemented lithostatic breccias. 
• Sandy breccia rocks of carbonatitic origin5. Carbonatite-related veins with fluorite 
have been recognised at several sites within the Speewah Dome.  
• Quartz veining related to the granophyre-syenogranite on the eastern margin of the 
dome. 
Based on the known geological relationships and exploration history Tambourah believes that 
potential exists for the following styles of mineralisation representing primary critical mineral 
and precious metal targets: 
• Epithermal – porphyry (mesothermal - epithermal Cu-Au, Ag-Au-Sb-barite-fluorite) 
• Orthomagmatic (Ti-V-PGE+Au) 
• Alkaline magma - carbonatite (fluorite, REE)

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data: Historic RC Drilling and Surface 
Sampling 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down hole gamma 
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge 
for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg 
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure 
of detailed information. 
• 
Rock Chips -  (Niplats & King River Copper) 
Rock chips were collected from outcrops or 
as float, sample size not provided. Details of 
the sample processing were retrieved from 
annual technical reports submitted to 
DEMIRS and stored in the WAMEX open file 
reporting system. 
 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, 
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of 
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc). 
• 
No drilling to report.  
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature 
of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse 
material. 
• 
No drill hole sampling to report. 
 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
level of detail to support appropriate 
Mineral Resource estimation, mining 
studies and metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography. 
• 
Rock chip - samples were described in the 
field 
by 
the 
geologist 
with 
some 
petrographic work to identify mineral 
composition and relationships.

Commentary 
Mineral 
tenement and 
land tenure 
status 
• Type, reference name/number, location 
and ownership including agreements or 
material issues with third parties such as 
joint ventures, partnerships, overriding 
royalties, native title interests, historical 
sites, wilderness or national park and 
environmental settings. 
• The security of the tenure held at the 
time of reporting along with any known 
impediments to obtaining a licence to 
operate in the area. 
• 
The historic rock chip sampling was 
conducted on E80/5889 held in the name 
of Baracus Pty Ltd. The tenement covers 
an area of 55 blocks, is in good standing 
and expires on 29th August 2028. There 
are no known third-party agreements or 
proposed wilderness areas or national 
parks in the tenement, which has a long 
history of previous mineral exploration. 
Tambourah is undertaking a review of 
historic exploration data to identify 
potential to critical mineral targets. The 
tenement is in good standing with no 
known impediments to obtaining a 
licence to operate in the area. 
Exploration 
done by other 
parties 
• Acknowledgment and appraisal of 
exploration by other parties. 
• 
Prior work carried out by Planet 
Management Group in the late 1960’s 
included 
soil 
sampling, 
geological 
mapping and limited percussion drilling 
for 
copper 
mineralisation. 
NiPlats 
Australia Ltd (Speewah Metals Limited) 
completed 
reconnaissance 
and 
stratigraphic RC and DD drilling, soil and 
rock chip sampling, a VTEM survey and 
aeromagnetic and radiometric surveys 
over the Speewah Dome. More recently, 
King River Copper carried out extensive 
work including surface sampling, RC 
drilling, aeromagnetic, SAM, IP and VTEM 
geophysical 
surveying. 
This 
work 
identified numerous areas of polymetallic 
mineralisation associated with extensive 
epithermal 
veining. 
The 
exploration 
focussed on precious metal and copper 
mineralisation 
that 
was 
commonly 
accompanied by elevated As and Sb. 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style 
of mineralisation. 
• 
Exploration targeted hydrothermal Au-
Ag-Cu mineralisation within the Speewah 
Dome where the target horizon (felsic 
granophyre-siltstone contact) interacts 
with structural complexities. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all information material to 
the understanding of the exploration 
results including a tabulation of the 
following information for all Material 
drill holes: 
• easting and northing of the drill hole 
collar 
• elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in metres) 
of the drill hole collar 
• dip and azimuth of the hole 
• down hole length and interception 
• 
A location plan and summary table of rock 
chip 
assays, 
including 
information 
provided in historic announcements, is 
included 
in 
the 
body 
of 
this 
announcement.

Commentary 
depth 
• hole length. 
• If the exclusion of this information is 
justified on the basis that the 
information is not Material and this 
exclusion does not detract from the 
understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain 
why this is the case. 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (eg cutting of high grades) 
and cut-off grades are usually Material 
and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should 
be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting 
of metal equivalent values should be 
clearly stated. 
• 
Spot surface sampling, no top-cuts were 
applied. 
• 
Surface sampling - No aggregation of high 
and low grades was reported. 
• 
No metal equivalent values were used for 
reporting exploration results. 
• 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation 
with respect to the drill hole angle is 
known, its nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down 
hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
Surface sampling only.  
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view 
of drill hole collar locations and 
appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Location plan and tabulated historic rock 
chip data included in the body of the 
announcement. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting 
of Exploration Results. 
• 
Review of historic surface sampling data 
to identify critical mineral targets.

Commentary 
Other 
substantive 
exploration data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful 
and material, should be reported 
including (but not limited to): geological 
observations; geophysical survey results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk samples 
– size and method of treatment; 
metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• 
There 
are 
no 
other 
substantive 
exploration results to report besides what 
is reported in this announcement. 
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further 
work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or 
depth extensions or large-scale step-out 
drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas 
of possible extensions, including the 
main geological interpretations and 
future drilling areas, provided this 
information is not commercially 
sensitive. 
• 
Further work will consist of follow up 
sampling within E80/5889 to verify 
historic 
rock 
chip 
samples. 
Data 
compilation and review of exploration 
data is on-going to identify priority targets 
for drilling.
