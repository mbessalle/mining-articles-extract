Proposed Acquisition of Critical Minerals at Speewah  
HIGHLIGHTS 
• Opportunity to acquire 80% of Speewah exploration licence E80/5889, 110km 
southwest of Kununurra in WA, subject to shareholder approval. 
• Represents an extension of the Company’s critical minerals portfolio into an area of 
significant endowment. 
• Speewah Dome is associated with a range of in-demand commodities, including 
critical minerals F (fluorine) and Sb (antimony).   
• Major deposits of F and V-Ti include Tivan Limited’s Speewah Fluorite deposit, that 
was recently awarded major project status1. 
• Multiple exploration targets within E80/5889 include historic vein-hosted Cu-Au-Ag-
Pb-Sb prospects.    
Tambourah Metals Limited (ASX:TMB) advises that the Board has reviewed the Speewah 
project and determined to enter into an agreement to acquire an 80% interest in tenement 
E80/5889 from Baracus Pty Ltd (ACN 009 132 334, Baracus Pty Ltd will retain a 20% interest), 
within the Speewah Dome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia (subject to 
shareholder approval at a general meeting of shareholders).  
Tambourah believes the project has potential to host critical minerals essential for the AI and 
energy transition, including Antimony (Sb) and Fluorine (F) associated with structurally 
controlled epithermal vein sets.  The nearby Speewah Fluorite Project was purchased by Tivan 
Limited for $20M and is currently progressing towards development under an alliance with 
Sumitomo Corporation. The fluorite project has recently been awarded major project status 
and a grant of $7.4M under the Australian government’s International Partnerships in Critical 
Minerals programme. 
Exploration licence E80/5889 is located 110km southwest of the town of Kununurra and is 
accessed via the Victoria and Great Northern Highways (see Figure 1). The tenement covers 
an area of 181 sq.km and is located over the northern half of the Speewah Dome, a domal 
structure comprised of sediments of the Speewah Group intruded by a composite sill of the 
Hart Dolerite. Major faults cutting Speewah Group sediments host the important Speewah 
Fluorite deposit whilst the layered gabbroic sill of the Hart Dolerite hosts a large V-Ti ± PGE 
deposit (see Figure 1). 
Large scale structures traverse the Speewah Dome into E80/5889. These structures and 
associated shears and splays are the setting for epithermal veining that hosts Cu-Ag-
Pb±Sb±Au mineralisation in a number of historic prospects located within the tenement2 (see 
Figure 2). There has been limited exploration focussing on critical minerals within the 
tenement.

Tambourah will conduct due diligence on the proposed acquisition over the next couple of 
months, including data compilation and review, follow up sampling and target generation 
whilst continuing to define priority drill targets at the Tambourah and Bryah Gold Projects in 
preparation for the 2025 field season. 
Terms of the Acquisition 
The Company has agreed to acquire an 80% legal and beneficial interest in exploration licence 
E80/5889  under a binding Heads of Agreement currently being finalised. E80/5889 is held in 
the name of Baracus Pty Ltd (ACN 009 132 334) (Baracus), a company controlled by Director, 
Rita Brooks (Proposed Acquisition).   
In consideration for the Proposed Acquisition, the Company has agreed to issue Baracus (or 
its nominee) 7,000,000 Shares* to the value of $196,000, at a deemed issue price of $0.028 
per share, subject to shareholder approval at a general meeting, which is expected to be held 
around mid February 2025.
