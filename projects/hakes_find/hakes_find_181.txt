Commenting on the acquisitions, Golden Horse MD & CEO Nicholas Anderson said:
"Golden Horse continues to execute its strategy of consolidating tenure across the Southern Cross
Greenstone Belt, which is one of Australia's top producing gold provinces. For decades this tenure
has been locked-up through fractured ownership, but with a concerted effort the Company is now
emerging as the dominant player in the region. The Hopes Hill acquisition is particularly significant as
it provides Golden Horse with another sizable land package within the Belt. The Hopes Hill mine
itself is also a fantastic asset with excellent past production plus some exciting but early-stage
exploration results which suggest a continuation of the gold-bearing structure."

Board also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000 Shares to the CEO as an inducement for the CEO
recently joining the Company's management team (the "Inducement Shares").
In accordance with the policies of the TSXV, since the number of awards outstanding under the Plan
issued to Insiders (as such term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) exceeds 10% of the
Company's issued and outstanding Shares as of the date of grant of the stock options and
performance rights, the foregoing grants of options and performance rights and the increase of the
number of Shares on reserve on settlement of performance rights under the Plan are subject to
receipt of disinterested shareholder approval at Company's upcoming annual general meeting
scheduled for November 12, 2024 (the "AGM"). In addition, since the amount of Inducement Shares
exceeds 1% of the Company's issued and outstanding Shares, the issuance of the Inducement
Shares is also subject to disinterested shareholder approval at the AGM in accordance with the
policies of the TSXV. The notice of meeting, management information circular (the "Circular") and
form of proxy for the AGM will be mailed to registered shareholders or beneficial shareholders'
intermediaries and will also be posted under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at
www.sedarplus.ca.
Each of the stock options issued to the CEO is exercisable for one Share at an exercise price of
C$0.39 per Share for a period of five years and will vest if and when the Company completes its
listing on the ASX. None of the stock options issued to the CEO may be exercised prior to receipt of
the disinterested shareholder approval approving the grant of the CEO Awards being sought at the
Meeting. Each of the performance rights granted to the CEO is subject to certain time and
performance vesting provisions with 30% of the performance rights vesting after one year from their
date of grant providing certain performance hurdles are met, an additional 30% vesting two years
from their date of grant providing certain other performance hurdles are met and the remaining 40%
of the performance rights will vest three years from the date of grant providing certain other
performance hurdles are met. If disinterested shareholder approval of the grants is not received at
the Meeting, the CEO Awards granted to the CEO will be cancelled.
Please refer to the Circular for additional information on the foregoing matters and for further details
on the necessary shareholder approvals being sought by the Company at the AGM. The grant of the
CEO Awards and the Inducement Shares each remain subject to the approval of the TSXV.
Deed of Release
Golden Horse also wishes to advise that the Company has entered into a deed of release dated
October 1, 2024, with applicants who had previously lodged Applications of Forfeiture with the
Wardens Court against the Emerald tenements.
The Company will provide the applicants with A$600,000 in Shares for the settlement of the
withdrawal of plaints over the Emerald tenements. The Shares will be issued to the applicants at the
same price that Golden Horse will issue in connection with its public offering as part of its admission
to the official list of the ASX.
Settlement is conditional on Golden Horse obtaining all regulatory approvals (including TSXV
approval) to the proposed issue of the settlement Shares and receiving ASX Listing Approval.
