"The option agreement for Hakes Find is an exciting acquisition for Altan Rio and could be a
potential near-term producing asset. Drilling by previous explorers has intersected high grade gold Exchange
mineralisation beneath historical mining operations at Hakes Find prospect and will be the target of
follow up work. Project Name
Results from a preliminary grab sampling program recently undertaken by the Company have been Hakes Find Project
very promising and validates the potential of this project. Western Australia, Australia
Our next step is to undertake further desktop studies with the aim to define the mineralised
envelope along strike and at depth and I look forward to updating the market as we progress this
work."

Historical exploration1
Numerous old workings and prospecting pits are scattered throughout the tenement area, accruing
since gold was first discovered within the Southern Cross district in the 1880's.
A small historical mining operation – Hakes Find – lies within the tenement area and was subject to
underground workings down to the water table at ~30 metres depth. Subsequently a small open cut
excavation was completed over the old underground mine.
Since the 1960's, several drill programs have been conducted across the tenement area by previous
owners. The most recent drilling campaigns were conducted in the 1990's by then-owner Finders
Gold NL mainly at Hakes Find, which they called their Devlin's Reward prospect.
Based on results from their drilling programs, Finders Gold NL estimated a non-JORC compliant
mineral resource for Hakes Find in 1995.
According to Finders Gold NL, a more coherent central zone was interpreted to hold better potential
for eventual economic exploitation with preliminary scoping work suggesting a lower waste to ore
stripping ratio compared to the entire gold deposit.
Results of metallurgical test work undertaken by Finders Gold NL on drill samples from the Hakes
Find deposit indicated sulphide mineralisation may be amenable to processing through a
conventional CIP/CIL treatment plant.
Recent work
Altan Rio has recently undertaken preliminary grab sampling from the face of the pit wall and along
strike at Hakes Find (see Figure 2) which has returned significant assay results including:
SX029 2.2 g/t
SX030 1.8 g/t
SX032 10.0 g/t
SX033 4.0 g/t
