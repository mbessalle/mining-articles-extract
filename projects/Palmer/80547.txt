# American Pacific Closes Transaction to Gain USD$10M and 100% Interest in the Palmer VMS Project in Alaska

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 2, 2024) - **American Pacific Mining Corp. (CSE: USGD) (OTCQX: USGDF) (FSE: 1QC1)**("**American Pacific** " or the "**Company** ") announced today that it has closed its previously announced transaction with Dowa Metals & Mining Alaska Ltd. ("**Dowa** ") to acquire Dowa's interest in Constantine Mining LLC, the holder of the Palmer VMS Project ("**Palmer** " or the "**Project** "). American Pacific would once again like to thank Dowa for its collaborative approach to work at Palmer over the years. 

**Transaction Terms**

Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement executed November 15th, 2024, Constantine North Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Pacific, has acquired Dowa's interest in Constantine Mining LLC (the "**Dowa Interest** ") and Dowa has paid American Pacific USD$10,000,000 in exchange for providing an affiliate of Dowa with an option to acquire up to 50% of the zinc concentrate produced for the initial year of production and each subsequent year of production at the Project and the provision of certain indemnities in the Purchase Agreement. With the close of the acquisition of the Dowa Interest, American Pacific has a consolidated 100%-interest in the Project. 

"This transaction marks a pivotal moment for American Pacific," commented American Pacific's Chief Executive Officer, Warwick Smith. "We've now obtained full ownership of a project with proven mineral resources and vast untapped regional discovery potential, while also securing substantial funding to ramp up exploration of key assets across our portfolio, paving the way for significant resource growth." 

**Palmer VMS Project**

The Palmer VMS Project is an advanced stage copper-zinc-gold-silver exploration project in Southeast Alaska with road access and located only 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the deep sea port at Haines, Alaska. More than USD$116M has been spent to-date at Palmer, with NI-43-101 mineral resources defined at the Palmer and AG deposits. Recent drilling (2023-2024) has highlighted the potential to define extremely rich copper zones and the Palmer Project includes numerous drill-ready, high-grade prospects that define more than 15 kilometres of favourable mineral trends, all hallmarks of a significant massive sulphide system.

The technical information in this news release regarding the Palmer Project has been reviewed and approved by Michael Vande Guchte, P.Geo., Vice President of Exploration for the Palmer Project and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.
