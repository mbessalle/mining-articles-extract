London, Ontario - TheNewswire - September 26, 2023 - Peloton Minerals Corporation (“PMC” or the “Company”) (CSE:PMC) (OTC:PMCCF) has staked and filed for recording 98 new mineral claims in northeastern Nevada after identifying significant outcrops of potential lithium bearing hectorite and illitic clays using hyperspectral minerology mapping technology. 

The newly staked claims are between and slightly south of two other claim blocks the Company holds in the area, Texas Canyon and Golden Trail, which are about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) apart, and also host hectorite and illitic clays similarly identified using hyperspectral minerology mapping technology. The total ground position now held by the Company in the area is 186 mineral claims or about 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres). 

A map accompanies this release showing the outline of the three claim blocks now held by Peloton, the hectorite and illitic occurrences identified on each claim block, and the proximity to Surge Battery Metals Inc. (“Surge”) to the west, who have tied onto the Company’s western most claim block (Texas Canyon), to the west and south. Surge has reported to have made a new lithium discovery in clays immediately west of the Company’s Texas Canyon claim block and is reported to be actively drilling at this time. 

Hectorite and illitic clays are the predominant lithium bearing minerals at Thacker Pass within the McDermitt Caldera in western Nevada which is the largest known measured and indicated lithium resource in the United States. 

The Company is planning a number of ground exploration programs and drilling of the hectorite and illitic outcrops. The Company has retained IBK Capital Corporation of Toronto to source lithium exploration capital.
