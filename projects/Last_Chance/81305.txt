The Last Chance property hosts a number of historical antimony-gold occurrences and a solitary shaft where limited historical production is recorded. They occur within a sequence of Paleozoic carbonates and Lower Mesozoic metamorphosed shales and carbonates; a series of ultramafic dykes as well as younger felsic intrusives and extrusives cut this sequence at several locations. Mineralization is structurally controlled, with folding, faulting and quartz veining seen throughout the metamorphosed sedimentary sequence at several locations across the property. Pursuant to signing a Letter of Intent to acquire this property, last month, Management had five additional mining claims staked to ensure that additional ground considered potentially prospective remains available to the Company when it begins its first field campaign scheduled for Q2/2025, as soon as the winter snows have melted.
