# Military Metals Completes Claim Staking Around the Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property in Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - November 28, 2024) - **Military Metals Corp.  (CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the "Company" or "MILI") **is pleased to report that it has completed additional staking of claims surrounding the Last Chance antimony-gold property, located in Nye County, Nevada, just over 70km north of the town of Tonapah and 12km due west of Kinross' Round Mountain gold mine. The Company recently entered into a letter of intent to acquire the Last Chance antimony-gold property. Please refer to the Company's news release dated November 14, 2024, for additional details about the Last Chance property.

Scott Eldridge, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, "Antimony prices have now risen to $38,000 USD per tonne, making antimony the top performing commodity thus far for 2024. China's export restriction that came into play September 15, 2024, has created a supply crunch that has magnified the need for domestic development of defense sector metals. This additional staking solidifies complete coverage of what we believe is the entire mineralized system surrounding the Last Chance antimony-gold property."

Historical antimony-gold occurrences and a solitary shaft where limited historical production is recorded occur within a sequence of Paleozoic carbonates and Lower Mesozoic metamorphosed shales and carbonates; A series of ultramafic dykes as well as younger felsic intrusives and extrusives cut this sequence at several locations. Mineralization is structurally controlled, with folding, faulting and quartz veining seen throughout the metamorphosed sedimentary sequence at several locations across the property.

A fence of claims was staked surrounding the Last Chance property to ensure that additional ground considered potentially prospective remains available to the Company when it begins its first field campaign scheduled for Q2/2025.
