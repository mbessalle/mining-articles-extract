# Military Metals Completes Acquisition of Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property in Nevada, Antimony Price Achieves New All-Time High over US$50,000 per Tonne(1)

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 19, 2025) - **Military Metals Corp. (CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the "Company" or "Military")** reports that as of February 14, 2025, it has completed the final cash payment owing to the vendor of the Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property, and as such has fulfilled all obligations required in order to acquire 100% interest in the subject property. The Vendor is currently in the process of transferring registration of the subject property to Military. The Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property is located 70 kilometers North of the town of Tonopah, Nevada, and 18 kilometers due west of Kinross's Round Mountain gold mine, on the eastern side of the Toiyabe Range.

Further, the Company's senior management team completed an initial field visit to the Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property. Originally discovered in 1880, the Last Chance antimony-gold deposit saw limited production during a few intervals until the early 1960s to support US defense efforts. Historical infrastructure, including a shaft and concrete foundations, remain on the property. Aside from limited gold-focused exploration during the 1980s, the property has not received further exploration activity. The Company looks forward to advancing modern geological programs focused on antimony mineralization to unlock value.

Military's CEO, Scott Eldridge, comments: "Last week we completed our initial site visit to the past producing Last Chance property and were very impressed by its past and future. Nevada is a top global mining jurisdiction that in addition to its notable precious metal mines hosts numerous historical antimony mines and prospects. The antimony spot price has yet again achieved a new all-time high, now trading at $51,500 USD per tonne(1). Antimony investment opportunities are limited to mining equities with no ETF or futures contracts available to investors, furthermore the mining equities are limited to a few high caliber companies."

Hosted within a series of deformed, metamorphosed Paleozoic clastic and carbonate sedimentary units, antimony-gold mineralization is found within a series of structurally and stratigraphically-controlled quartz veins. Historical workers have documented that gold-dominant veins crosscut antimony-dominant veins, indicating more than one phase of mineralization. Several samples of mineralized quartz vein material were found within the historical dumps featuring fine-grained, subhedral metallic grey minerals varying from sub-millimeter stringers to semi-massive flooding within a quartz vein host.

Green copper oxide staining on weathered specimens seen in the dumps and elsewhere indicate that tetrahedrite and/or other copper-bearing minerals may occur in the assemblage.

A polished section will be prepared so that minerals comprising this assemblage can be identified. Likewise, a sample comprising selected grabs of mineralized material from the dumps has been sent for multi-element analysis. Management will digest the results of this field visit and incorporate them into its plans for a comprehensive field program planned for Q2-3 that will focus on the potential for additional clusters of mineralized veins, key to the property's potential.
