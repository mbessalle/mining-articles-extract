# Stuhini Announces Option of Jersey Valley Gold Property

VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 27, 2024 /CNW/ - Stuhini Exploration Ltd. ("**Stuhini** " or the "**Company** ") (TSXV: STU) (OTCQB: STXPF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement (the "**Agreement** ") with Goodsprings Exploration LLC and others with an effective date of November 15, 2024 (the "**Effective Date** ") whereby Stuhini can acquire a 100% interest in the Jersey Valley Property ("**Jersey Valley** ", "**Project** ", or the "**Property** "), located in Pershing County, Nevada (the "**Option** ").

The Jersey Valley Property is a gold exploration project located in the well-known Battle Mountain area of Nevada. The Property comprises 143 unpatented lode claims, covering 2954.5 acres (1195.7 hectares) and is located in a favourable structural and lithostratigraphic setting. Access to the Property from Battle Mountain is approximately 70 kilometres ("km") by paved and gravel roads.

The lithostratigraphic units of the Project area include calcareous siltstones and sandstones of the Havallah Formation, which have been strongly silicified. The Havallah is the primary host rock at the nearby Buffalo Valley and Lone Tree gold mines. Outcrops of the Havallah on the Jersey Valley Property include jasperoids, iron-oxide-stained fractured calcareous siltstones, and acid-leached siltstone breccias - see photos in Figure 1. Rock samples have returned anomalous values of pathfinder elements, such as arsenic – 2100 ppm, antimony – 266 ppm, mercury – 21 ppm, silver – 4 ppm and gold values up to 75 ppb. This anomalous geochemistry combined with the acid-leaching of the calcareous units within the Havallah exposed on the Property are interpreted to be the result of strong vapour-phase alteration associated with a lithocap.

There is evidence of very limited work by two companies on the Property in the 1990s. This work included a small trenching program conducted by Barrick Gold. Sampling results from both work programs are unknown. Uranerz Exploration and Mining Limited also drilled two west-directed drill holes in the southern area of the Property and three holes in the northern area. Efforts have been made to track down this historical data but were unsuccessful. At the time of the drilling, 300-foot-deep holes were typical for exploration programs and may not have tested the potential for deeper mineralization.

Stuhini President and CEO Dave O'Brien commented: "We are excited to obtain an option on the Jersey Valley Property on reasonable and non-dilutive terms. The Property represents an opportunity for us to explore in a jurisdiction known for being well endowed with precious metals and hosting several large mines over the years."

During the 30-year term of the Agreement, Stuhini must make the following minimum payments (until the commencement of commercial production on the Property) (the "**Minimum Payments** ") to keep the Option in good standing:

**Minimum Payments** | **Payment Dates**  
---|---  
On signing the Agreement | U.S.$7,500 plus reimbursement of Owner's   
  
payment of the BLM mining claim maintenance   
  
fees and Nevada mining claim fees for the Property   
  
in the amount of U.S.$2,000.00  
1st anniversary of Effective Date | U.S.$7,500  
2nd anniversary of Effective Date | U.S.$10,000  
3rd anniversary | U.S.$15,000  
4th and each succeeding   
  
anniversary of the Effective Date   
  
until the Commencement of   
  
Commercial Production of   
  
Minerals from the Property, as   
  
adjusted for inflation   
  
commencing on the sixth   
  
anniversary of the Effective Date | U.S.$25,000  
  
There are no work commitments associated with the Option and the only committed obligation is the US$7,500 cash payment on signing.  The balance of the Minimum Payments are all at the Company's election should it wish to maintain the Option after year 1.

Stuhini may exercise the Option at any time by making a cash payment of US$300,000 (in addition to any Minimum Payments already made).  Upon exercise of the Option, Stuhini will grant a 2.0% gross returns royalty (the "**Royalty** ") on the Property, subject to Stuhini's right to purchase 50% of the Royalty (representing 1.0% of the gross returns) for US$2,000,000 within 30 days of commencement of commercial production.  Minimum Payments made after the exercise of the Option shall be credited against the Royalty payments.
