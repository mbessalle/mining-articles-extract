ASX: LGM 
Helix Resources to Farm-in to Legacy’s Central Cobar Project, NSW 
Central Cobar Project  
• 
The Central Cobar Project (Project, EL9511) covers approximately 308km2 in the world-class 
exploration and mining jurisdiction of Cobar, NSW.  
• 
Located 10km from the Peak Gold Mine and 10km from the CSA Mine, the Project is considered 
to have the right ingredients for Cobar-type deposits and contains numerous undrilled targets.  
Discovery-Focused Joint Venture 
• 
The Farm-in Joint Venture is a ‘discovery-focused’ farm-in will see generative work and drilling 
conducted with the goal of unearthing a Cobar-type discovery.  
About Helix Resources 
 
Helix Resources (ASX: HLX) is a Cobar-focused and well-funded, ASX-listed company with a sizeable 
ground position exploring the prolific copper-producing region of Cobar. 
Key Farm-in Terms  
• 
Helix Resources can spend $2.8 million to earn an 80% interest in EL9511 in three stages: 
o Stage 1 – $0.8 million over 2 years to earn a 51% interest; 
o Stage 2 – $0.8 million over 2 years to earn a further 14% interest; and 
o Stage 3 – $1.2 million over 2 years to earn a further 15% interest (up to 80%).  
• 
Minimum commitments include geophysics and 700m of drilling within 12 months.   
• 
At each stage, LGM has the option to contribute or dilute, and if LGM’s interest dilutes below 10%, 
it will convert to a 2% gold Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) or a 1.2% NSR if base metal dominant.

Legacy Minerals Holdings Limited (ASX: LGM, “the Company” or “Legacy Minerals”) is pleased to 
advise that it has entered into an Earn-In and Farm-In Agreement with Helix Resources (ASX: HLX) at 
its 100%-owned Central Cobar Project, EL9511, located in NSW, Australia.  
Management comment – Legacy Minerals CEO & Managing Director, Christopher Byrne said:  
“We are pleased to announce this discovery-focused partnership with Helix Resources covering our 
Central Cobar Project. The Project is strategically located and has a largely untested ground package 
with excellent geological prospectivity. Situated in a blue-chip position in central Cobar, it encompasses 
ground directly along the strike from Metals Acquisition Corp’s CSA Mine and also sits adjacent to and 
along strike from Aurelia Metals’ Peak Gold Mine.  
“The Helix Resources Team has extensive knowledge and experience in the Cobar region. Their long-
term commitment to the district gives them an edge in the search for Cobar-type deposits and 
operational efficiencies, and we believe they are the right partner to take the Project forward. 
“The Project area presents an exceptional opportunity to discover Cobar-type deposits within a stone’s 
throw of an operating mill at Aurelia’s Peak Gold Mine. This agreement will focus on unlocking the 
Cobar Project's potential while allowing Legacy to remain focused on the discovery opportunities at 
our 100%-owned projects – Drake, Black Range and Thomson.”

The Strauss and Kylo Mineral Resources have been estimated using a gold cut-off of 0.3g/t Au and 
25g/t Ag, 0.1% Cu, 0.1% Pb, and 0.1% Zn. The Guy Bell Mineral Resource has been estimated using a 
cut-off of 0.5g/t Au and Red Rock has been estimated using a 0.7g/t Au cut-off. Silver dominant 
Mineral Resources (Lady Hampden, White Rock, White Rock North, and Silver King) have been 
estimated using a cut-off of 25g/t Ag. The Red Rock, Guy Bell, Lady Hampden, White Rock, White Rock 
North, and Silver King Mineral Resources was prepared and reported in accordance with the JORC 
Code (2004). The Resources figures have not been updated since to comply with the JORC Code 2012 
on the basis that the information has not materially changed since it was last reported.
