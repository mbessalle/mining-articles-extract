19 August 2024
HELIX EXPANDS COBAR COPPER-GOLD FOOTHOLD
Highlights
• Earn-in rights agreed on Legacy Minerals Ltd’s Cobar Project covering ~308 km2 in the highly prospective
copper and gold region near Cobar, NSW.
• Located only 10km from the Peak Gold Mine (Aurelia Ltd) and 10km from the CSA Copper Mine (Metals
Acquisition Ltd), this agreement provides Helix with further exposure to high-grade Cobar-style copper-gold
base-metal prospectivity including a suite of drill-ready targets.
• Helix’s exploration portfolio now boasts an exceptional set of drillable targets prospective for copper, gold
and base metals in a well-established mining region close to infrastructure.
• Helix intends to move directly into ground geophysics surveys to refine existing geophysical targets ahead
of drill testing.

ASX: HLX

Helix Resources Ltd (ASX:HLX, Helix or the Company) is pleased to announce it has agreed terms for an Earn-in
Joint Venture Agreement with Legacy Minerals Ltd (ASX:LGM; “Legacy”) to undertake exploration for gold,
copper, silver and base metals on its Central Cobar project. The two parties have signed a binding Letter
Agreement setting out the staged earn-in and joint venture terms. The Central Cobar Project on Exploration
Licence 9511 covers approximately 308km2 in the established Cobar mining region, NSW. It is located
approximately 10 km west of Cobar township in NSW in an area which hosts several operating gold, copper and
base metal mines (Figure 1).
Helix’s Managing Director, Kylie Prendergast commented:
“This agreement provides Helix with an exciting exploration opportunity located close to operating gold and
copper mines and having the potential to discover Cobar-type mineralisation with several, well regarded, undrilled
targets. We are pleased that Legacy has agreed this opportunity and recognised the local expertise that Helix can
contribute here. We look forward to working with Legacy to hopefully make a new discovery on this underexplored
piece of ground.”
Farm-in on the Central Cobar Project
Legacy’s Central Cobar Project (EL9511) covers approximately 308km2 in the well-endowed mining jurisdiction of
Cobar NSW. It is located only 10km from Aurleia’s Peak Gold Mine and 10km from Metals Acquisition Ltd’s CSA
Copper Mine. The portfolio of targets in Legacy’s Central Cobar Project, complements Helix’s existing exploration
portfolio (Figure 2) and provides exposure to additional Cobar-style copper gold base-metal prospectivity in
addition to bringing in numerous undrilled targets that can be quickly moved through to drilling.
Legacy has delineated a series of defined Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) geophysical anomalies which are
described in the recent Legacy ASX Announcement1 and shown in Figure 3:
“Woggle - characterised by a coincident magnetic high and AEM conductor. The Woggle magnetic anomaly is a
discrete magnetic high favourably positioned on a rheological contact between the Biddabirra Formation and
the CSA Siltstone. The anomaly potentially reflects disseminated magnetic pyrrhotite which is characteristic of
alteration halos to Cobar-type deposits. AEM has identified a subtle late time peak anomaly that is coincident
with the peak of the magnetic response. Ground truthing has confirmed the response does not appear to be
related to a cultural feature and sits in an area of thin colluvial cover.
Furthermore, a series of AEM anomalies have been identified which are spatially associated with the regional
Myrt Fault. It is a major NNW-SSE trending structure which can be delineated undercover from airborne
magnetic data. These anomalies are beneath thin colluvial cover sediments that can mask geochemical
responses of buried deposits. The high priority AEM anomalies identified by the Company, are characterised by
discrete and moderate-to-late time conductive responses that may be along strike of, or adjacent, to nearby
anomalous geochemistry and sit in structural locations interpreted to be interpreted to be favourable for
Cobar-type ore deposits.
Legacy Minerals considers the AEM anomalies to present compelling targets and references Metals Acquisition
Corp’s (ASX MAC), SEC S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary - CSA Copper Mine, Australia – MAC2. Metals
Acquisition Corp had a total of 9-lines of the same Xcite AEM survey covering and area which had previously
been flowed with another airborne electromagnetic survey in 2001. The comparison between the systems
showed the 2001 AEM and high quality 2019 Xcite AEM data agree well in the early EM channels (0.4-1.2ms).

This data has been reliably used to identify and interpret geophysical signatures that might be associated with
prospective structures and enhanced weathering due to sulphides at depth or lithological variations.”
Key Earn-In Terms
Helix and Legacy have executed a binding Letter Agreement which sets out the staged earn-in and potential joint
venture terms as summarised below:
• Helix Resources can spend A$2.8 million to earn an 80% interest in EL9511 in three stages:
o Stage 1 – $0.8 million over 2 years to earn a 51% interest;
o Stage 2 – $0.8 million over 2 years to earn a further 14% interest; and
o Stage 3 - $1.2 million over 2 years to earn a further 15% interest (up to 80%).
• Minimum commitments include geophysics and 700m of drilling within 12 months.
• At each stage, LGM has the option to contribute or dilute, and if LGM’s dilute interest drops below 10%, it will
convert to a 2% gold Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) or a 1.2% NSR if base metal dominant.
Next Steps
• Refine and test drill targets: Helix is in the process of planning ground geophysical surveys over up to
three of the highest priority AEM targets (Woggle, Xcite 6, 40060A in Figure 3). Drill planning will be
undertaken in parallel and commence as soon as possible subject to weather and contractor availability.
• Follow-up AEM and geochemical targets: multiple other targets have been generated by Legacy (Figure
3) which will be systematically evaluated by Helix with field work, auger geochemical sampling and
geophysics.

About Helix Resources
Helix Resources is an ASX-listed resources company which is exploring in the prolific copper producing region of Cobar,
NSW. The Company possesses a sizable ground position (~3,300km2) which is largely untested despite being located
proximal to significant copper and gold producing operations. The strategy is to generate new copper and gold targets
and test them through drilling to make new discoveries.
1. Helix is the operator of the Helix-Legacy earn-in which is
located 10 km west of the Cobar township. The area, which
hosts several operating gold, copper and base metal mines, is
prospective for Cobar-style copper-gold base metal deposits.
2. The Western Tenement has 30km of prospective strike
and a pipeline of wholly owned copper opportunities, as well
as the Canbelego JV Project (70% Helix as operator and 30%
Aeris Resources) where a Mineral Resource of 32.8kt of
contained copper has been estimated (refer Appendix A).
3. A 4 km by 1 km historical gold field is being evaluated
on the Muriel Tank tenement.
4. The Eastern Tenement Group encompasses more than
100km of prospective strike. The company has defined an
extensive zone of new anomalies considered and is
prospective for Tritton-style copper-gold deposits.
