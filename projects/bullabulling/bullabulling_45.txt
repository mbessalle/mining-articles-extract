Transaction and Project Summary Bullabulling Gold Project Location
➢ Minerals 260 Limited (ASX:MI6) to acquire 100% of the Bullabulling Gold Project (Project) and
surrounding exploration ground from Norton Gold Fields Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd.
(Proposed Transaction), for total consideration of $166.5 million comprising:
▪ $156.5 million cash consideration1 and $10.0 million scrip consideration (with the number of fully
paid ordinary shares being issued based on the issue price used for the proposed equity raise).
➢ With a JORC 2012 RPEEE2 reportable Mineral Resource estimate of 60Mt @ 1.2g/t Au for 2.3Moz3,
Bullabulling is one of Australia’s largest open pittable near-term production gold resources.
➢ Previous metallurgical test work undertaken showed that the resource is amenable to conventional
carbon-in-leach processing and the average gold recovery utilised for the resource was 87%.
➢ Strong foundations support a near-term production goal, including approximately 12,000 drill holes for
530,000 metres across the Project.
➢ Resource is on granted mining leases, located in the world class mining location of Western Australia in
the infrastructure rich Coolgardie / Goldfields Region and has a Native Title Land Use Agreement.
Conditions, Funding and Timing
➢ Transaction completion is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, an equity raise to fund the
purchase, ASX re-compliance and other additional standard conditions for a transaction of this nature.
➢ MI6 propose to fund the Proposed Transaction and working capital to progress the Project to final investment
decision via an equity raise. Further details on the equity raise will be provided in due course.
➢ Bell Potter Securities Limited and Argonaut Securities Pty Limited have been appointed as Joint Lead
Managers to execute the equity raise.

Snowden- Optiro Updated Bullabulling Mineral Resource of
60.3Mt @ 1.2g/t Au for 2.3Moz
Bullabulling Mineral Resource Estimate as of December 2024 (RPEEE)
Geology
The Bullabulling project is located in the Archaean
Yilgarn Craton approximately 65 km southwest of
Kalgoorlie, and 25km west of Coolgardie in Western
Australia.
The Coolgardie domain is bounded by the Zuleika
Shear to the east and the Ida Fault to the west and
contains greenstone sequences. The Burra Granite
makes up the southern part of the Coolgardie
Domain. A major structure, the Kunanalling Shear
Zone passes through the middle of the domain as
well as many folds and thrusts which repeat the
greenstone stratigraphy.
Deposit Type
Gold mineralisation is predominately shear-hosted in
a continuous sequence of amphibolite which strikes
approximately 8.5km. The amphibolites range from
hornblende-rich to quartz-rich and sit on an
ultramafic basement.
