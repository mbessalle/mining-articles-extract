Bullabulling Gold Project Overview 
Bullabulling presents a potential open pit mining operation located 25km south-west of Coolgardie in the 
Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia. The Project hosts a JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate of 
60Mt @ 1.2g/t Au for 2.3Moz of gold (Indicated and Inferred, refer to Table 1 below), on granted mining leases 
(M15/503, M15/1414, M15/282, M15/554 and M15/552) and is located within a largely contiguous 293sq km 
tenement package.  
Bullabulling offers significant exploration upside, with multiple highly prospective targets at depth and along 
strike, which could support the plan to grow the mineral resource further and will be a focus of exploration 
drilling by the Company.
