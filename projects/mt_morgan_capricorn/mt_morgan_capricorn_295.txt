ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
 
14 March 2025 
 
Tenement Consolidation Creates Significant New District-
Scale Gold-Copper Belt Project in Central Queensland 
 
SUMMARY 
➢ 
Lithium Energy has entered into binding agreements to consolidate a number of contiguous exploration 
tenements in Central Queensland that are prospective for gold, porphyry copper and VMS 
mineralisation.  The tenements are adjacent to and surround the historic Mt Morgan Gold Mine. 
➢ 
The tenements with an area of 1,795 km2 have been consolidated to create a significant new district-
scale project named the “Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project”. 
➢ 
Consideration for the acquisition of a 100% interest in the consolidated tenement package comprises: 
• 
$3 Million in cash payable over 2 years; 
• 
Contingent Payments (up to $2.5 Million in total) on achievement of exploration success and 
feasibility study milestones; and 
• 
A 2% NSR royalty (with partial buy-back option). 
➢ 
Terms of acquisition include a $4 Million expenditure commitment by Lithium Energy over 2 years. 
➢ 
An extensive exploration program over high priority targets is to commence immediately following 
completion of the acquisition. 
➢ 
The Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project tenement consolidation forms part of the Company’s strategy 
towards seeking the reinstatement of its shares to quotation, subject to further consultation with ASX.  
 
Lithium Energy Limited (ASX:LEL) (Lithium Energy or Company) is pleased to confirm that it has entered into 
binding acquisition agreements with private and public company vendors to consolidate approximately 1,795 
km2 of contiguous granted and application stage exploration permits in Central Queensland, forming a 
significant new consolidated district-scale exploration project called the Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project 
(Project or Capricorn Project) (Figure 1). 
 
These granted tenements and tenement applications cover a large area and are considered by Lithium Energy 
to be prospective for gold, porphyry copper and volcanic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralisation.  The 
Company has, in determining to enter into these transactions, reviewed and taken into account a substantial 
amount of historical exploration data relating to the Project area.  This historical data has not however yet 
been fully validated by the Company to the extent that it can be reported to JORC Code (2012) standards.  As 
the Company advances with its own exploration work on the Project tenements it will continue with its review 
of the historical data.  The Company does not believe that the form and nature of the historic exploration data 
over the Project area is sufficiently material for its disclosure in this announcement.

The terms of the acquisition include cash consideration from Lithium Energy of $3 Million payable over two 
years (split between the tenement vendors), a series of contingent payments (up to $2.5 Million in total) upon 
achievement of certain milestones and a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty (with a partial buy-back option 
in favour of the Company).  Lithium Energy has also committed to a minimum exploration and evaluation 
expenditure of $4 Million on the Project tenements within the next two years. 
 
Lithium Energy Executive Chairman, William Johnson:  
The acquisition of the Capricorn Project is the first new project acquisition since the Company sold its 
flagship Solaroz Lithium Brine Project in Argentina and sets an exciting new direction for Lithium Energy. 
This is the first time that this extensive group of tenements has been consolidated under a single 
ownership.  The Capricorn Project acquisition presents the Company with an exciting series of 
prospective targets in an area surrounding and adjacent to the historically highly productive Mt Morgan 
gold mine. 
Following completion of the acquisition, Lithium Energy will undertake an extensive program of 
exploration activities including data compilation, geophysics and drilling to test the highest priority 
target zones in the Capricorn Project – including seeking repeats of multiple Mt Morgan style gold-
copper and porphyry copper-molybdenum prospects. 
With regard to the current suspension of the Company’s shares from trading on the ASX following the 
sale of the Solaroz Project, the ASX has confirmed that one of the conditions for reinstatement to 
quotation is for the Company to demonstrate a sufficient level of activities. The commencement of 
activities on the Capricorn Project will be an important step towards the lifting of the suspension.

ABOUT LITHIUM ENERGY LIMITED (ASX:LEL) 
Lithium Energy Limited is an ASX listed battery minerals company which is developing its flagship Solaroz Lithium Brine Project in 
Argentina and the Burke and Corella Graphite Projects in Queensland.  The Solaroz Lithium Project (LEL:90%) comprises 12,000 hectares 
of highly prospective lithium mineral concessions (where a JORC Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource of lithium has been delineated) 
located strategically within the Salar de Olaroz Basin in South America’s “Lithium Triangle” in north-west Argentina. The Burke and 
Corella Graphite Projects (LEL:100%) in Queensland, Australia, contains high grade JORC Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources of 
graphite.   
On 3 April 2024, Lithium Energy and NOVONIX Limited (ASX:NVX) announced the merger of their adjoining Burke and Mt Dromedary 
Queensland Natural Graphite Deposits into Lithium Energy subsidiary, Axon Graphite Limited (Proposed ASX Code: AXG) (Axon 
Graphite), which will undertake a $15M to $25M initial public offering (IPO) and seek admission to ASX as a dedicated vertically-
integrated mine to Battery Anode Material (BAM) product manufacturing company.  Lithium Energy shareholders approved the 
proposed spin-out of Axon Graphite at a general meeting held on 7 February 2025. 
On 30 April 2024, Lithium Energy announced the sale of its interest in the Solaroz Project to a subsidiary of CNGR Advanced Materials 
Co Ltd (CNGR) for US$63 Million (~A$97 Million) cash.  On 6 December 2024, Lithium Energy announced amended Soloraz sale terms 
(with completion in two tranches (April 2025 and January 2026) and with no change to the total cash consideration).  Lithium Energy 
shareholders approved the proposed sale of Solaroz at a general meeting held on 8 August 2024 (in respect of the original sale 
agreement) and on 15 January 2025 (in respect of the Amended Sale Agreement). 
The Company announced on 25 October 2024 that ASX had determined the Company did not have a sufficient level of operations to 
warrant the continued quotation of its securities in the context of Lithium Energy having entered into a sale agreement to dispose of its 
main undertaking (being the Solaroz Lithium Project). The Company’s securities were accordingly suspended from trading on ASX.  The 
Company has subsequently engaged with the ASX to address the conditions required for the lifting of the suspension.  Efforts are 
currently focused on meeting ASX's criteria for the Company’s reinstatement to quotation, including resuming exploration drilling at the 
Solaroz Lithium Project.  Additionally, the Company is pursuing the acquisition of new resource projects, such as the Capricorn Gold-
Copper Belt Project, as part of its strategy to achieve reinstatement of its securities. 
Pending completion of the sale of Solaroz, Lithium Energy will continue to advance operations at Solaroz, with funding to be provided 
by CNGR (under the terms of the amended sale agreement), advance the Axon Graphite IPO and investigate and potentially undertake 
(where appropriate) investment opportunities principally in the battery mineral projects sector in Australia and overseas, subject to 
compliance with the Listing Rules of the ASX.

ANNEXURE A 
 
CAPRICORN GOLD-COPPER BELT PROJECT 
 
The Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project tenements surround the historically prolific Mt Morgan gold mine in 
Queensland (Mt Morgan Mine) which operated from 1883 until 1981, producing ~50 Mt of ore at 4.99 g/t Au 
and 0.72% Cu, containing 7.65 million ounces of Au, 1.2 million ounces of Ag and 360kt of Cu.1, 2, 3   
 
 
Figure 1: Location Map of Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project showing geological setting 
 
The Capricorn Project contains multiple targets for gold, copper, molybdenum and zinc mineralisation, 
including over 30 km of strike length of the Middle Devonian age Mt Morgan Intrusive Complex which is 
interpreted to be the source of the Mt Morgan Mine gold and copper mineralisation1,4.  The Mt Morgan Mine 
itself is not included in the Capricorn Project, though one focus of exploration activity for gold will be to test 
for repeats of Mt Morgan style gold mineralisation along strike within the Project area. 
 
Upon completion of the acquisition of the first (51%) tranche of the Capricorn Project, which is expected to 
occur during March/April 2025, the Company plans to undertake an extensive program of exploration using 
modern geophysical techniques. (including the use of advanced 3D analytics which will be applied to historical 
and new data) to guide an extensive drilling program over identified priority areas, targeting multiple large-
scale Au, Cu, Mo, and Zn mineralised systems.
