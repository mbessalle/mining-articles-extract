MinRex Resources Limited (ASX: MRR) (“MinRex” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the execution of a binding
farm-in option agreement with West Cobar Metals Limited (ASX:WC1) for MinRex to acquire a 50% interest in the Fraser
Range Copper-Gold Project (WA). The key terms of the agreement are summarised below. The project comprises
granted exploration licences E63/2078 and E63/2083 together with mineral rights to all minerals in the basement
of E63/2056.
Technical Director, Ian Shackleton commented:
“We are delighted to be partnering with Matt and his team at West Cobar Metals to test quality IOCG and Broken Hill
Type (BHT) targets in the highly prospective Fraser Range region. We share their enthusiasm for the copper-gold targets
which are considered to be located in prime IOCG and BHT terrane in a major crustal shear zone.”
“Exploration activities at the Fraser Range Copper-Gold Project will commence immediately, with heritage survey
clearance of proposed drilling locations to be completed in the first week of April followed by RC drill testing of five high
priority IOCG and BHT targets planned for completion within 4 months.”
“We look forward to the program commencing and updating the market on progress in what will be an exciting few
months for both MinRex and West Cobar Metals as the targets are tested.”
About the Fraser Range Copper-Gold Project
The Fraser Range Project is located approximately 120 km north-east of the township of Esperance in southern Western
Australia. Exploration Licences E63/2056, E63/2078 and E63/2083 cover an area of approximately 360km2 on
undeveloped state land and are 100% owned by West Cobar Metals Limited (WC1).
The project area lies in the Biranup Zone, a structural extension from the Fraser Zone, that hosts the Nova-Bollinger Ni-
Cu deposit and is of similar age (ca 1.65 Ga) to the Iron Oxide Copper-Gold (IOCG) mineralisation in the Gawler Craton
(ca. 1.59 Ga Olympic Province)1. Iron Oxide Copper-Gold deposits are strongly associated with intense alkaline
magmatism events associated with melting of previously metasomatised lithospheric mantle. Major deposits are all
located close to the margins of Archean cratons such as the mafic dominated Fraser Zone in the Albany-Fraser Orogen2.

ASX Code: MRR
Broken Hill Type (BHT) deposits consist of high-grade metamorphosed silver-zinc-lead mineralisation (e.g. Broken Hill,
and Cannington deposits) hosted by Proterozoic aged gneiss and schist. They can be detectable by gravity (high density
massive sulphides), magnetics (if they contain pyrrhotite) and EM Surveys (conductive sulphides).
Project generation studies undertaken by WC1 utilising geophysical and geological data sets have defined several high
priority IOCG and Broken Hill Type (BHT) targets.
Introduction
The project area occurs within a structurally complex region of the Fraser Range Terrane and is centred above a deep
regional gravity anomaly (~50 milligals) thought to reflect buried mafic-ultramafic rocks similar to those that host the
Nova-Bollinger Ni-Cu deposit, and potential BHT host stratigraphy found in north-west Queensland (Mt Isa Belt) and at
Broken Hill (NSW)2.
Figure 1: Geology (Geological Survey, WA), showing prospects and the high priority copper BHT & IOCG style targets.

ASX Code: MRR
The Fraser Range Project remains under explored for IOCG, BHT and Magmatic Ni-Cu styles of mineralisation
due to the area being covered by generally thin (0-40m) surficial transported cover that renders conventional
geochemistry ineffective and has constrained the geological understanding of the area2.
An extensive review by WC1 of the existing detailed airborne magnetic data and in areas of interest supported
by either closely spaced company acquired airborne Electro-Magnetic (AEM), and ground gravity data to
generate multiple IOCG and BHT style targets. The targets have been refined with three IOCG (Glenmorangie,
Oban and Talisker) and two BHT (Benriach and Glendronach) targets prioritised for drill testing to depths of
200m to 300m.

ASX Code: MRR
Talisker target
The Talisker target is situated on E63/2078 (Figures 1 & 2) in complex zone of magnetic highs and lows typical of
magnetite alteration on a major East-West shear zone with northwest-southeast trending cross-cutting structures and
dykes. The magnetic anomalies lie on a broad gravity high ridge with a circular gravity low of 400m x 400m diameter
(Figure 3). The gravity low correlates strongly with a deeper Electro- Magnetic (EM) conductor from the historical
SkyTEM survey(2, 3).

with EM conductors (RHS).
Figure 4: Talisker target EM conductors from historical SkyTEM (AEM) survey Channel 6, modelled at >30m depth3.
Glenmorangie target
The Glenmorangie target is situated on E63/2056 (Figures 1 & 2) and comprises a bulls-eye magnetic high that is about
600m x 800m and that lies on the margins of a larger circular feature, cut by a demagnetised NW-SE structure (Figure
5). The gravity is wide spaced but shows an elevated regional background. No previous Electro-Magnetic (EM) survey
has been flown.

Oban target
The Oban target lies in E63/2056 (Figures 1 & 2) and comprises a complex zone of magnetic highs and lows typical of
magnetite alteration associated with regional cross-cutting structures. The magnetic anomalies lie on a broad gravity
anomaly (Figure 6).

ASX Code: MRR
Benriach and Glendronach targets
The Benriach target lies in E63/2056 (Figures 1 & 2) and comprises an area of magnetic bullseyes over an area of around
900m x 600m in a broad area of magnetic lows (Figures 7 & 8), that is also coincident with a gravity high. The geophysical
anomalies and the interpreted geology of depleted granite-gneiss are suggestive of BHT style target. The Glendronach
target also lies in E63/2056 (Figures 1 & 2) and corresponds with a gravity feature along an interpreted garnet quartzite
horizon that is considered prospective BHT style of mineralisation (Figures 7 & 8).

Farm-in Option Agreement
The key terms of the farm-in and option agreement between MinRex and WC1 are summarised below:
1. MinRex is granted an exclusive option to acquire a 50% interest in exploration licences E63/2078 and E63/2083 and
50% of the rights to all minerals in the basement of E63/2056 by providing $500,000 towards funding of exploration
activities on the project as follows:
a. $50,000 deposit already paid to provide funding for the aboriginal heritage survey to be completed in April
2025.
b. $150,000 upon WC1 receiving PoW approvals under the Mining Act for at least 2,000m of drilling to test
the five priority targets on the project as agreed between MinRex and WC1.
c. $150,000 upon mobilisation of a drilling rig to the project which is capable of performing the planned
drilling activities.
d. $150,000 upon completion of drilling.
2. The parties have agreed a budget and program for the proposed exploration activities, which WC1 will use best
endeavours to complete as soon as reasonably practicable and within 4 months. Where the parties jointly agree to
expand the exploration activities at the project or continue exploration activities in the event of cost overruns due
to events outside WC1’s control, the parties will equally share the costs to complete such activities.
3. During the option period, MinRex and WC1 must deal exclusively with each other in relation o the sale of any right,
title or interest in the project.
4. MinRex may terminate the agreement if the Aboriginal heritage survey is not completed by 31 May 2025 or the
survey does not provide the approvals required to carry out the planned drilling. WC1 may terminate the
agreement if MinRex fails to make the above payments when due and such non-payment is not remedied within
10 business days of a written demand from WC1 to do so.
5. MinRex may elect to withdraw from the option at any time during the option period, however (except where Minrex
has terminated the agreement because the Aboriginal heritage survey has not been completed by 31 May 2025 or
the survey does not provide the approvals required to carry out the planned drilling as contemplated above) such
withdrawal does not limit MinRex’s funding obligations above.
6. The Agreement will automatically terminate if MinRex does not exercise the option during the option period.
7. MinRex may exercise the option within 3 months of receiving assays from the last drilling completed on the project
as part of the agreed exploration activities.
8. Upon exercise of the option, the parties will form an unincorporated joint venture on customary terms, which will
include standard pro-rata funding and dilution mechanisms, reciprocal pre-emptive rights, customary conditions,
warranties, covenants and indemnities and automatic conversion of a party’s interest in the joint venture into a
0.5% NSR royalty where a party’s interest dilutes below 5%.
9. The agreement otherwise contains representations, warranties and undertakings which are customary for an
agreement is its nature.

• The AFMB is an arcuate belt of Paleao-
Mesoproterozoic aged, high metamorphic grade mafic
to felsic gneisses and granulites, granitic rocks.
• The project area lies within the Biranup Complex (1650-
1800 Ma) dominated by strongly deformed migmatitic
gneiss, with lesser granite, amphibolite and gabbro.
Drill hole Information | • A summary of all information material to
the understanding of the exploration results
including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
• easting and northing of the drill hole collar
• elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation
above sea level in metres) of the drill hole
collar
• dip and azimuth of the hole
• down hole length and interception depth
• hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is
justified on the basis that the information is
not Material and this exclusion does not
detract from the understanding of the
report, the Competent Person should
clearly explain why this is the case. | • No drilling data reported.
• Drilling has not been carried out yet to test these
targets.
Data aggregation
ethods | • In reporting Exploration Results, weighting
averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate
short lengths of high grade results and
longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation
should be stated and some typical
examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of
metal equivalent values should be clearly
stated. | • No drilling data reported. No variation or aggregation
methods have been applied to any other data.
Relationship between
ineralisation widths
nd intercept lengths | • These relationships are particularly
important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole
lengths are reported, there should be a
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down
hole length, true width not known’). | • No drilling data reported.
• Exploration is at an early stage and the targets are
conceptual.
