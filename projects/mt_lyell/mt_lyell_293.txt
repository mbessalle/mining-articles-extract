ASX RELEASE 
Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner commented:  
“While we are focused on exploring and developing the Orient and Antimony Reward projects in 
Queensland, as part of Iltani’s ongoing business development activities we are seeking to target 
opportunities which will increase Iltani’s exposure to critical minerals and copper. In this case, we 
identified an opportunity to apply for vacant ground in Tasmania containing known secondary copper 
(the Copper Clays) mineralisation which is contiguous with Mt Lyell, a major copper deposit.  
With receipt of the licence, we will commence evaluating the historical exploration data to better 
understand the Copper Clays’ secondary copper mineralisation and the potential to generate new 
targets on the licence area.” 
 
1. EL6/2024 
Iltani has been granted EL6/2024, a 20km2 exploration licence in Tasmania, which is contiguous with 
the Mount Lyell Copper Project (9M/2013) (refer to Figure 1). 
The Mount Lyell Copper Project (Mining Lease 9M/2013) is held by Copper Mines of Tasmania (CMT) 
Pty Ltd, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Sibanye-Stillwater (a multinational mining company listed on the 
JSE & NYSE). Sibanye-Stillwater acquired an option over CMT through its acquisition of New Century 
Resources Limited (ASX:NCZ) in 2021. Sibanye-Stillwater subsequently exercised this option in 
November 2023. 
The Mount Lyell project has the following key parameters1: 
 Underground Mineral Resource of 71.3Mt @ 1.03% Cu & 0.26 g/t Au (1.14 % Cu Eq.) 
 Open Pit Mineral Resource of 69.0Mt @ 0.64% Cu & 0.17 g/t Au (0.71% Cu Eq.) 
 Proposed Mine Life of 25 years with annual production of 27ktpa Cu & 16koz Au. 
 
Iltani applied for the ground as part of its strategy to target copper opportunities, after reviewing the 
historical exploration data for the area, in particular the data relating to the secondary copper deposits 
(the Copper Clays). 
With the licence granted for a five-year period to 14 August 2029, this gives Iltani an opportunity to 
undertake a detailed review of the Copper Clays project plus the multiple other historical mineral 
occurrences and exploration targets on the EL to decide the best route to maximise value from this 
project. 
 
2. Copper Clays 
The exploration licence covers three known secondary copper deposits: Lyell Consols, Lyell Blocks and 
King Lyell. These native copper and copper oxide deposits are hosted in highly deformed and intensely 
weathered limonitic and carbonaceous clays and concretionary iron hydroxides, derived from Gordon 
Group limestone and shale altered by copper bearing acid waters draining from primary Mt Lyell 
copper sulphide mineralisation up slope.   
Total production (from 1892 to 1910) was estimated to be 243,000 tonnes of ore grading 1.6% Cu for 
2,750 tonnes of copper. The copper was predominately present as native copper, and gravity recovery 
methods were used to recover the copper to a high-grade concentrate (estimated to be approximately 
70% Cu). 
Copper Mines of Tasmania (CMT) undertook a detailed review of the open cut potential of the Copper 
Clay deposits in 1995 (Open Cut Potential of the Copper Clays Area, Mt Lyell Tasmania) based on the 
previous 112 years of mining and exploration history.

The review used data from 46 diamond drill holes (~4,000m drilled) completed between 1902 and 
1970 to produce sectional resource estimates and basic open pit designs. 
CMT subsequently engaged AMC Consultants Pty Ltd (AMC) to prepare a scoping study (Copper Clays 
Scoping Study) during 2007 of the copper clays deposits. The study evaluated the deposits and 
determined at that time, the King Lyell deposit was the only deposit that justified further attention. 
The scoping study was completed in February 2008 and covered a geological review, geotechnical and 
metallurgical assessments, mining options and costs, optimization, conceptual designs for open pit, 
waste dumps and scheduling plus financial and risk analysis. The main conclusions of the scoping study 
underlined that the King Lyell deposit had sufficient potential to provide a significant minable resource 
for CMT. More drilling was recommended prior to a pre-feasibility study (AMC, 2008). 
CMT completed a resource drilling program consisting of 11 HQ vertical diamond drill holes (rotary-
mud pre collared) during 2011 (Figure 3), with material assay results from the drilling program detailed 
in Table 1.

Assuming a 0.5% cut-off grade, nine of the 11 holes intersected intervals of significant mineralisation 
ranging from 2-10m thick (see table below). The best intersections, expressed as metres x %Cu 
occurred in DD11CMT012 (10m @ 0.81% Cu) and DD11CMT014 (7m @ 1.2% Cu) and overall the zone 
of mineralisation is encouragingly consistent in terms of average grade, thickness and RL. The mean 
thickness of mineralisation in the nine holes is 6m and the mean weighted (to thickness) grade is 0.91% 
Cu.

3. Next Steps 
With the grant of EL6/2024, Iltani has commenced a review of all historical data with an immediate 
focus on understanding the potential of the secondary copper deposits (Copper Clays). 
While exploration and development of its Orient and Antimony Reward projects in Queensland 
remains its focus, Iltani believes that the Copper Clays could offer the opportunity to build a low-cost 
mining operation (open pittable with recovery by gravity processing to produce a high-grade native 
copper concentrate) and as such could create material value.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. 
cut channels, random chips, or 
specific specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to 
the minerals under investigation, such 
as down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken 
as limiting the broad meaning of 
sampling. 
 
Include reference to measures taken 
to ensure sample representivity and 
the appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to 
the Public Report. 
 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ 
work has been done this would be 
relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse 
circulation drilling was used to obtain 
1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge 
for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types 
(e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
 Sampling reported is historic drilling completed by 
Copper Mines of Tasmania Pty Ltd in 2011. 
 The core was cut and half core was submitted for 
assay 
Drilling 
techniques 
 
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse 
circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary 
air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) 
and details (e.g. core diameter, triple 
or standard tube, depth of diamond 
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, 
whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc). 
 A resource drilling program consisting of 11 HQ 
vertical diamond drillholes was completed. Drilling 
totalled 857m, all holes were pre collared using a mud 
rotary drill technique. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
 
Method of recording and assessing 
core and chip sample recoveries and 
results assessed. 
 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative 
nature of the samples. 
 
Whether a relationship exists 
between sample recovery and grade 
and whether sample bias may have 
occurred due to preferential loss/gain 
of fine/coarse material. 
 Detailed measurements of core recovery were 
undertaken. 
 Drilling practices focused on ensuring the best 
possible core recovery was achieved. Before drilling 
commenced Gerald Spaulding Drillers engaged AMC 
consultants to design a mud programme suitable for 
drilling through the types of clays expected. Drilling 
practices included using a slow rod rotation rate and 
minimising water entering the hole for bit lubrication. 
This process was successful as recoveries through the 
mineralised clay were considerably better than 
previous drilling attempts.

Data aggregation 
methods 
 
In reporting Exploration Results, 
weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (e.g. cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
 
Where aggregate intercepts 
incorporate short lengths of high 
grade results and longer lengths of 
low grade results, the procedure used 
for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such 
aggregations should be shown in 
detail. 
 
The assumptions used for any 
reporting of metal equivalent values 
should be clearly stated. 
 
No data aggregation methods have been used and  
no metal equivalents are used. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
 
These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
 
If the geometry of the mineralisation 
with respect to the drill hole angle is 
known, its nature should be reported. 
 
If it is not known and only the down 
hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this 
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
 No drilling was undertaken by Iltani 
Diagrams 
 
Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported. These 
should include, but not be limited to a 
plans and sections. 
 
Refer to plans and sections within report 
Balanced 
reporting 
 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low 
and high grades and/or widths should 
be practiced to avoid misleading 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
 
The accompanying document is considered to 
represent a balanced report 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
 
Other exploration data, if meaningful 
and material, should be reported. 

