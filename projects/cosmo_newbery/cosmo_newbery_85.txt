CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
Information in this news release that is not a statement of historical fact constitutes forward-looking
information. Such forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding
the prospectivity of the Cosmo Gold Project, information with respect to Sarama having or acquiring
mineral interests in areas which are considered highly prospective for gold and other commodities
and which remain underexplored, costs and timing of future exploration, the potential for exploration
discoveries, the intention to gain the best commercial outcome for shareholders of the Company,
timing and receipt of approvals, consents and permits under applicable legislation and the
completion of a transaction to acquire the Cosmo Gold Project. Actual results, performance or
achievements of the Company may vary from the results suggested by such forward-looking
statements due to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include,
among others, that the business of exploration for gold and other precious minerals involves a high
degree of risk and is highly speculative in nature; Mineral Resources are not mineral reserves, they
do not have demonstrated economic viability, and there is no certainty that they can be upgraded to
mineral reserves through continued exploration; few properties that are explored are ultimately
developed into producing mines; geological factors; the actual results of current and future
exploration; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be evaluated, as well as those
factors disclosed in the Company's publicly filed documents.
There can be no assurance that any mineralisation that is discovered will be proven to be economic,
or that future required regulatory licensing or approvals will be obtained. However, the Company
believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking information are
reasonable. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the Company's ability to
carry on its exploration activities, the sufficiency of funding, the timely receipt of required approvals,
the price of gold and other precious metals, that the Company will not be affected by adverse
political and security-related events, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and
effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain further financing as and when required
and on reasonable terms. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
Sarama does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except as required by
applicable laws.
