Cosmo Newbery Project
Project Name
The Project is comprised of 7 contiguous exploration tenements covering approximately 580km²
in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, approximately 85km north-east of Laverton and Cosmo Newbery Project
95km west of the world-class Gruyere Gold Mine. The Project is readily accessible via the Great
Central Road which services the Cosmo Newbery Community.
The Project captures one of the last unexplored greenstone belts in Western Australia and with a
strike length of +50km, the Cosmo Newbery Belt represents a large and prospective system
with gold first being discovered in the area in the 1890's. Multiple historical gold workings are
documented within the Project area and work undertaken to date has identified multiple exploration
targets for follow up.
Despite this significant prospectivity, the Project has seen virtually no modern explorationor
drilling of merit due to a lack of land access persisting over a significant period. As a result, the
Project has not benefited from the evolution of geochemical and geophysical techniques which now

Following the relatively recent securing of land access, the Project is now available for systematic
and modern-day exploration programs to be conducted on a broad-scale. It is anticipated that future
exploration programs will initially follow-up preliminary targets generated from regional soil
sampling and limited reconnaissance drilling programs, a majority of which extended to
approximately 5m below surface with a small percentage extending up to 30m below surface.

FOOTNOTES
1. Sarama, via its 100%-owned subsidiary, has acquired from Cosmo an 80% interest in all the
Project's Exploration Licences, with the exception of E38/2274 for which Sarama has acquired
an effective 60% interest (with Cosmo retaining a 15% interest and an existing joint tenement
holder retaining a 25% interest). The tenements in which Sarama has acquired an 80%
interest account for approximately 80% of the total area of the Project. For a period of 2-years
following completion of the Transaction, Sarama has the right to acquire Cosmo's remaining
20% interest, which would result in Sarama having an aggregate 100% interest, in all the
Project's Exploration Licences (with the exception of Exploration Licence E38/2274 which
would be held 75% by Sarama and 25% by an existing joint tenement holder in the event that
Sarama exercises the option to acquire Cosmo's remaining interest in the Project).
2. The Project is comprised of the following contiguous Exploration Licences: E38/2851,
E38/3456, E38/2627, E38/2274, E38/3525, E38/3249 and E38/2774 covering approximately
580km². Prior to completion of the Transaction, Cosmo had a 100% interest in all the Project's
Exploration Licences with the exception of E38/2274 for which Cosmo held a 75% interest.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Information in this news release that is not a statement of historical fact constitutes forward-looking
information. Such forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding
the prospectivity of the Cosmo Gold Project, information with respect to Sarama having or acquiring
mineral interests in areas which are considered highly prospective for gold and other commodities
and which remain underexplored, costs and timing of future exploration, the potential for exploration
discoveries and generation of targets, the intention to gain the best commercial outcome for
shareholders of the Company, timing and receipt of approvals, consents and permits under applicable
legislation and the completion of a transaction to acquire Cosmo's residual interest in the Cosmo
Gold Project. Actual results, performance or achievements of the Company may vary from the results
suggested by such forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors. Such factors include, among others, that the business of exploration for gold and other
precious minerals involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative in nature; Mineral
Resources are not mineral reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability, and there is
no certainty that they can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration; few
properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines; geological factors; the
actual results of current and future exploration; changes in project parameters as plans continue to
be evaluated, as well as those factors disclosed in the Company's publicly filed documents.
There can be no assurance that any mineralisation that is discovered will be proven to be economic,
or that future required regulatory licensing or approvals will be obtained. However, the Company
believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking information are
reasonable. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the Company's ability to
carry on its exploration activities, the sufficiency of funding, the timely receipt of required approvals,
the price of gold and other precious metals, that the Company will not be affected by adverse
political and security-related events, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and
effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain further financing as and when required
and on reasonable terms. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
