with gold first being discovered in the area in the 1890's. Multiple historical gold workings are
documented within the Project area and work undertaken to date, has identified multiple exploration
targets for follow up.
Despite this significant prospectivity, the Project has seen virtually no modern exploration or
drilling of merit due to a lack of land access persisting over a significant period. As a result, the
Project has not benefited from the evolution of geochemical and geophysical techniques which now
facilitate effective exploration in deeply weathered and complex regolith settings which is
particularly pertinent given approximately 75% of the Project area is under cover.
Following the relatively recent securing of land access, the Project is now available for systematic
and modern-day exploration programs to be conducted on a broad-scale. It is anticipated that future
exploration programs will initially follow-up preliminary targets generated from regional soil
sampling and limited reconnaissance drilling programs, a majority of which extended to
approximately 5m below surface with a small percentage extending up to 30m below surface.

Final TSX-V approval for completion of the transaction is anticipated once various compliance items
are filed. The Transaction has enjoyed support from the shareholders of both Sarama and Cosmo
shareholders.
Sarama and Cosmo have been jointly working on the maintenance of the mineral tenure for the 7
exploration licences comprising the Project. These efforts have culminated in the extension of
several licences for new terms and receipt of recent advice from the Western Australian Department
of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety has confirmed that all tenements are current and in
good standing.
Introductions to the Traditional Owners of lands within the Project area have been made and these
groups are supportive of Sarama's involvement in the Project, which will be confirmed with the
procedural assignment of access agreements closer to the time of completion of the Transaction.
Cosmo has generated valuable base level data that has identified a number of target areas including
kilometre-scale gold-in-soil anomalies and multiple structural and geophysical targets. Soil

FOOTNOTES
1. Upon completion of the Transaction, Sarama, via its 100%-owned subsidiary, will acquire from
Cosmo an 80% interest in all the Project's Exploration Licences, with the exception of
E38/2274 for which Sarama will acquire an effective 60% interest (with Cosmo retaining a
15% interest and an exisitng joint tenement holder retaining a 25% interest). The tenements
in which Sarama will acquire an 80% interest account for approximately 80% of the total area
of the Project. For a period of 2-years following completion of the Transaction, Sarama will
have the right to acquire Cosmo's remaining 20% interest, which would result in Sarama
having an aggregate 100% interest, in all the Project's Exploration Licences (with the
exception of Exploration Licence E38/2274 which would be held 75% by Sarama and 25% by
an exisitng joint tenement holder in the event that Sarama exercises the option to acquire
Cosmo's remaining interest in the Project).
2. The Project is comprised of the following contiguous Exploration Licences: E38/2851,
E38/3456, E38/2627, E38/2274, E38/3525, E38/3249 and E38/2774 covering approximately
580km². Cosmo currently has a 100% interest in all the Project's Exploration Licences with the
exception of E38/2274 for which Cosmo holds a 75% interest.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
Information in this news release that is not a statement of historical fact constitutes forward-looking
information. Such forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding
the prospectivity of the Cosmo Gold Project, information with respect to Sarama having or acquiring
mineral interests in areas which are considered highly prospective for gold and other commodities
and which remain underexplored, costs and timing of future exploration, the potential for exploration
discoveries and generation of targets, the intention to gain the best commercial outcome for
shareholders of the Company, timing and receipt of approvals, consents and permits under applicable
legislation and the completion of a transaction to acquire the Cosmo Gold Project. Actual results,
performance or achievements of the Company may vary from the results suggested by such forward-
looking statements due to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors
include, among others, that the business of exploration for gold and other precious minerals involves
a high degree of risk and is highly speculative in nature; Mineral Resources are not mineral reserves,
they do not have demonstrated economic viability, and there is no certainty that they can be
upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration; few properties that are explored are
ultimately developed into producing mines; geological factors; the actual results of current and future
exploration; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be evaluated, as well as those
factors disclosed in the Company's publicly filed documents.
There can be no assurance that any mineralisation that is discovered will be proven to be economic,
or that future required regulatory licensing or approvals will be obtained. However, the Company
believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking information are
reasonable. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the Company's ability to
carry on its exploration activities, the sufficiency of funding, the timely receipt of required approvals,
the price of gold and other precious metals, that the Company will not be affected by adverse
political and security-related events, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and
effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain further financing as and when required
and on reasonable terms. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
