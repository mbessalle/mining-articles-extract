    "description": "ASX Announcement RESOURCES LIMITED 28 March 2025 @ Helix Diversifies with Acquisition of White Hills Copper-Gold Project, Arizona. * Helix enters conditional binding agreements to acquire the White Hills copper-gold project in Arizona, USA comprising a total of 7 tenements over 23 km?2. * Located in the Arizona Arc, a belt prospective for copper-gold porphyry and 10CG deposits, which also lies within the southern part of the Nevada Walker Lane gold trend, host to several multi-million ounce gold deposits in Arizona. + Previous work undertaken included soil and rock chip sampling, airborne geophysics (magnetics and radiometrics), ground gravity, airborne hyperspectral, and 10 historical drillholes that were only analysed for gold. Rock chip and soil samples contain multiple areas of copper and gold anomalism. * The project is easily accessible year-round with a 1.5 hours road journey from Las Vegas and has excellent infrastructure, being ~50 km from the revitalised Mineral Park copper porphyry mining operation. * The acquisition is viewed as complimentary to Helix’s existing Cobar copper-gold assets. Helix continues to undertake a whole of project review of the Cobar assets to obtain the best outcomes for shareholders, which may include joint ventures. Helix’s Executive Chairman, Mike Povey commented: “The addition of the White Hills project in Northern Arizona provides the Company with an exciting opportunity in a part of the world renowned for producing world-class copper/gold deposits. The results of geochemical exploration to date has provided compelling evidence of a copper/gold system that is the best candidate that | have seen in many years for more intensive exploration efforts. Our intention is to move as quickly as possible in our evaluation of White Hills and the vendors, two highly experienced geologists with an intimate knowledge of working in the western USA, will be of great help in our exploration efforts. The board and management remain entirely focused on building long-term value for our shareholders, and we are confident this acquisition will play a key role in that growth. We look forward to progressing this outstanding opportunity” H E L b X Helix Resources Ltd ABN 27 009 138 738 | Level 4 225 St Georges Terrace, Perth WA 6000 | +61 8 93212644.
