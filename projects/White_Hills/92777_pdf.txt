### Highlights
*   Helix enters conditional binding agreements to acquire the White Hills copper-gold project in Arizona, USA comprising a total of 7 tenements over 23 km².
*   Located in the Arizona Arc, a belt prospective for copper-gold porphyry and IOCG deposits, which also lies within the southern part of the Nevada Walker Lane gold trend.
*   Previous work undertaken included soil and rock chip sampling, airborne geophysics, ground gravity, airborne hyperspectral, and 10 historical drillholes that were only analysed for gold.
*   The project is easily accessible year-round, a 1.5 hours road journey from Las Vegas, and is ~50 km from the revitalised Mineral Park copper porphyry mining operation.
*   The acquisition is viewed as complimentary to Helix's existing Cobar copper-gold assets.

**Helix's Executive Chairman, Mike Povey commented:**
> "The addition of the White Hills project in Northern Arizona provides the Company with an exciting opportunity in a part of the world renowned for producing world-class copper/gold deposits. The results of geochemical exploration to date has provided compelling evidence of a copper/gold system that is the best candidate that I have seen in many years for more intensive exploration efforts."

### SUMMARY

Helix Resources Limited (ASX: HLX) has entered into conditional Binding Agreements with Centric Minerals Management (USA) Inc (Centric) and White Hills Exploration LLC ("White Hills Exploration”), (the Vendors) to acquire the White Hills Project, a strategic portfolio of copper-gold tenements in Arizona, USA.

The project is located 50 km from the Mineral Park porphyry copper-molybdenum-silver mine operated by Waterton Copper and comprises 7 tenements totalling 23 km² entailing:
*   Five Private Mining Sublease claims (under farm-in agreement by Centric with Newmont).
*   Two State Leases held by White Hills Exploration.

### Key Commercial Terms

Helix entered non-binding exclusivity agreements with the Vendors in February and has now reached Binding Agreements. The completion of the Agreement (Settlement) is subject to several conditions including the Company entering into formal agreements with the Vendor.

**Acquisition Terms (to acquire 100% of the project):**
*   **Payment of A$100,000** (including A$40,000 paid to date) for claims fee and A$60,000 on signing a Binding Letter Agreement.

*   **Newmont Right to Back-in:** If the Company progresses to a pre-feasibility study (PFS), Newmont has the right to back in, pay the Company 1.5 times the exploration expenditure, and form a 51:49% JV to develop the project.
*   **Royalty:** Newmont retains a production royalty of 2.5% net smelter return from the Property.

### Project Description
The White Hills project is located in the Arizona Arc, a belt prospective for world-class copper-gold porphyry and IOCG deposits. Originally explored for gold, the project also contains copper anomalies that have not been adequately followed up.

### Forward Work Programs
Following completion of Formal Agreements, Helix intends to commence preparation for a drill program. It is anticipated 2000m of diamond core will be drilled in 4 x 250m holes. Helix has undertaken to the Vendors that it will fund the programs by a capital raising of not less than A$1.0 million, expected in the second quarter 2025.
