# Sienna Enters Into an Agreement for an Option to Acquire 100% of the "Elko Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada Bordering Surge Battery Metals

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - August 17, 2023) - Sienna Resources Inc. (TSXV: SIE) (OTC Pink: SNNAF) (FSE: A1XCQ0) ("Sienna" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an arm's length property option agreement whereby it has been granted an option to acquire a 100% interest in the "Elko Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. This project consists of approximately 1200 contiguous acres directly bordering Surge Battery Metals' "Nevada North Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. This agreement is subject to TSX Venture Exchange (the "Exchange") approval. The Nevada North Lithium Project has retuned some of the highest grades for lithium in Nevada. According to Surge's website, "Drill hole NN2207 intersected the thickest intervals of lithium-rich claystone encountered to date; a total of 120.4 metres (395 feet) averaging 3,943 parts per million lithium in four zones." Plans are being formulated immediately for the first phase of work on this project. Sienna management cautions that past results or discoveries on properties in proximity to Sienna may not necessarily be indicative of the presence of mineralization on the company's properties.

Jason Gigliotti, President of Sienna states, "This is one of the most exciting lithium regions in North America. The grades that were encountered by Surge are some of the highest grades attained in Nevada and having a project that is directly bordering this new lithium discovery holds tremendous promise for Sienna's shareholders. We plan to immediately commence plans for the first phase of work on this project. Not only do we have this new lithium project, but Sienna is one of the largest landholders in Clayton Valley, Nevada through its other property interests. Sienna has adequate cash resources for anticipated exploration plans and we expect to very active on multiple fronts in the remainder of 2023. Management is very optimistic about the future and looks forward to what will happen in the ground on these projects."
