Kali Expands Pilbara Joint Venture with SQM 
 
Highlights 
• 
Kali Metals (ASX:KM1) (“Kali Metals” or “the Company”) has reached an agreement with SQM, the 
existing joint venture (“JV”) partner in its exploration projects in the Pilbara, to expand the area of the 
JV and amend the terms of the existing Earn-In Agreement1. 
• 
As part of the expanded JV, Kali has entered into binding transaction documentation to acquire the 
following strategic additional Pilbara tenements: 
o 
DOM’s Hill: Exploration licence applications E45/6646 and E45/6647; and 
o 
Pear Creek: Exploration licence E45/6457. 
• 
The new tenements: 
o 
Are contiguous to the Company’s existing tenement portfolio in the Pilbara (Refer Figure 1), and so 
the Company is well placed to capitalise on cost synergies in its exploration of this new tenure; and 
o 
Increase the Company’s Pilbara landholding by ~129km2.  
• 
The Company has also renegotiated the terms of its Earn-In Agreement with SQM. Key amendments 
include: 
o 
Newly acquired tenements (refer above) to be incorporated into the JV; 
o 
SQM to spend a minimum of $500,000 on exploration by 15 December 2025 to retain its 30% 
interest in Kali’s DOM’s Hill and Pear Creek tenements (Refer Annexure A for tenements covered 
by the Earn-In Agreement); 
o 
SQM have committed to an additional $1,000,000 of expenditure, now $4,250,000 by 15 
December 2026, to earn a 50% interest in the expanded JV tenements; and 
o 
Kali to retain 100% ownership of Marble Bar Project (Refer Figure 1). 
 
Paul Adams, Managing Director of Kali Metals commented:  
“Kali is delighted to secure E45/6646, E45/6647 and E45/6457, all of which are strategically placed to 
allow Kali to expand its exploration plans in the highly prospective lithium region of the Pilbara. As 
flagged in its Prospectus, the Company has been assessing and reviewing a number of opportunities to 
expand its portfolio of assets and is pleased to be able to execute these agreements. This acquisition 
will increase our Pilbara lithium footprint and the potential of delivering value through the discovery of 
a lithium resource in the Pilbara. 
We are also pleased to have renegotiated the terms of our Earn-In Agreement with SQM to not only 
include these new tenements, but also increase the expenditure commitment for SQM’s 50% earn-in 
right, by $1 million. Kali has enjoyed a successful working relationship with SQM in the Pilbara, and we 
look forward to exploring with SQM on our new and existing tenements.”

The Pilbara 
The Pilbara region of WA is the “Land of the Lithium Giants”. Kali’s Pilbara Projects include DOM’s Hill and 
Marble Bar, located east of world-class lithium deposits Pilgangoora and Wodgina (Refer Figure 1).  
From completion, acquisition of the new tenements will increase Kali’s landholding in the Pilbara by ~129km2. 
Given the contiguousness of the new tenements to Kali’s existing Pilbara tenure, in particular its DOM’s Hill 
and Pear Creek Projects (Refer Figure 1), the Company is in a great position to capitalise on cost synergies and 
efficiencies to streamline its exploration in this highly prospective lithium region.

The New Tenements 
DOM’s Hill 
Exploration licence applications E45/6646 and E45/6647 are contiguous to the South-West and East of Kali’s 
DOM’s Hill Project (Refer Figure 1). 
As part of a preliminary due diligence, Kali completed a desktop review to evaluate the lithium prospectivity of 
the additional tenements. The new tenements host a large volume of Aplite rock, indicating potential as a 
favourable geological setting for pegmatite emplacement. 
Kali is acquiring the new DOM’s Hill tenements from major shareholder Kalamazoo Resources Limited (ASX: 
KZR “Kalamazoo”) for cash consideration of $100,000 + GST.  
Pear Creek 
Exploration licence E45/6457 is located contiguously to the South of Kali’s existing Pear Creek Project (Refer 
Figure 1). Kali’s preliminary due diligence on E45/64567 suggests further exploration to test lithium 
mineralisation at this tenement is warranted. 
Kali is acquiring E45/6457 from Kalamazoo for $20,000 + GST. 
The Australian Securities Exchange confirmed Listing Rules 10.1, 11.1.2 and 11.1.3 do not apply to the 
acquisition of the new tenements, and the Company confirms it will not reallocate any funds from existing 
projects to explore on the new tenements. 
SQM Earn-In Agreement 
Key Amendments 
The Company has renegotiated the terms of its Earn-In Agreement with SQM3. Key amendments include: 
o 
Newly acquired tenements (refer above) to be incorporated into the joint venture; 
o 
SQM to spend $500,000 on exploration by 15 December 2025 to retain its 30% interest in Kali’s 
DOM’s Hill and Pear Creek tenements (Refer Figure 1 for tenements covered by the Earn-In 
Agreement); 
o 
Increased $1,000,000 commitment, now $4,250,000 by 15 December 2026, to earn 50% interest 
in relevant tenements; and 
o 
Kali to retain 100% ownership of Marble Bar Project (Refer Figure 1). 
For a full list of the tenements covered by the Earn-In Agreement, refer Annexure A. 
Marble Bar  
The Marble Bar tenements (Refer Figure 1) are to be retained 100% by Kali under the new terms of the Earn-
In Agreement. The Company is excited about the lithium potential, with the tenements located due south of 
Archer lithium deposit. Previously, a 1.4km long LCT pegmatite outcrop was located by Kalamazoo Resources 
Limited prior the Company’s official admission to the ASX in January 2024, with the spodumene-lepidolite 
mineralogy confirmed in thin sections4. The main pegmatite hosts lithium mineralisation up to 2.81% Li2O5.
