Vancouver, British Columbia – TheNewswire - February 21, 2024 -- Emergent Metals Corp. ("Emergent" or the “Company”) (TSXV:EMR) announces that it has further expanded its New York Canyon Property (“New York Canyon” or the “Property” in Nevada by acquiring 6 unpatented lode claims (the “Yorkie Claims”) from Western Geoscience Inc. (“WGI”).  The Property now consists of 21 patented claims and 792 unpatented mining claims totaling about 16,000 acres (6,500 hectares).  Located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Hawthorne, New York Canyon hosts copper skarn and porphyry exploration targets including Longshot Ridge, Copper Queen, Champion, and Emma.  

Emergent has acquired the claims for US$66,000 ($US$12,000 paid to WGI with six additional monthly payments of US$9,000 due February 15, 2024 (paid) and continuing through July 15, 2024).  In addition, Emergent will grant WGI a 2% Net Smelter Royalty (“NSR”) on the claims capped at US$1,750,000.

David Watkinson, President and CEO of Emergent stated, “Addition of the Yorkie Claims finalizes the consolidation of a major land position at the New York Canyon Property, hosting multiple copper exploration targets with a very low acquisition cost.  The Yorkie Claims are just south of Lahontan Gold Corporation’s (TSXV: LG) Santa Fe Project, which hosts the past producing Santa Fe Gold Mine.  The Yorkie claims also have potential to host gold mineralization as well as base metals.”  

About Emergent

Emergent is a gold and base metal exploration company focused on Nevada and Quebec. The Company’s strategy is to look for quality acquisitions, add value to these assets through exploration, and monetize them through sale, joint ventures, option, royalty, and other transactions to create value for our shareholders (an acquisition and divestiture business model). 

In Nevada, Emergent’s Golden Arrow Property is an advanced stage property with a well-defined measured and indicated gold and silver resource.  The New York Canyon Property is a copper skarn, copper porphyry, and gold exploration property south of and abutting the past producing Santa Fe Gold Mine. The Mindora Property (aka West Santa Fe Property) is a gold, silver, and base metal property located twelve miles from the Santa Fe Gold Mine and optioned to Lahontan Gold Corporation (TSXV:LG). Buckskin Rawhide East is a gold and silver property leased to Rawhide Mining LLC, operators of the Rawhide Mine. Emergent also owns the Buckskin Rawhide West and Koegel Rawhide properties, two early-stage gold and silver projects located near Rawhide Mine.

In Quebec, the Casa South Property is a large gold exploration property adjacent to and south of Hecla Mining Corporation’s (NYSE:HL) operating Casa Berardi Mine with multiple exploration targets identified.  The Trecesson Property, located about 50 km north of the Val d’Or mining camp, has three gold exploration targets with multiple high-grade (>10 g/t) gold intercepts from historic and recent drilling.  Also in Quebec, Emergent has a 1% NSR in the Troilus North Property, part of the feasibility stage Troilus Mine Property being explored by Troilus Gold.  Emergent also has a 1% NSR in the East-West Property, owned by O3 Mining and part of their feasibility stage Marban Alliance Property.

Note that the location of Emergent’s properties adjacent to producing or past producing mines does not guarantee exploration success at Emergent’s properties or that mineral resources or reserves will be delineated.
