# Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. Purchases Land at South Mountain, and Announces Results of Annual Meeting

Boise, Idaho--(Newsfile Corp. - December 13, 2023) - Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (OTCQB: THMG) (TSXV: THM) (the "Company" or "THMG") announced today that it has purchased an additional 56 acres of strategic land at the Company`s South Mountain Project. 

The land is a combination of both patented and private land, with full mineral rights, and was previously leased by the Company. The parcel is contiguous with the South Mountain patented claims and is important to the future development of the Texas Zone. This land acquisition covers a gap in the main mine area and eliminates any outside ownership within the main mine area.
