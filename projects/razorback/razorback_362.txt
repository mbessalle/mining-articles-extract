Razorback Project
located immediately south and along trend of the 3 million tonne (contained copper) historic Mt Lyell
mine which has generated significant copper and gold since starting production in the late 1800's
and still has a reported 25-year mine life3. Previous exploration work completed at Razorback
indicates the presence of significant copper, gold and rare earth mineralization including in surface
sampling and drill intercepts. We look forward to initiating a work program to advance exploration at
Razorback including following up on the significant copper-gold and rare earth surface showings and

can be broadly compared with the Andean Coastal Cordillera IOCG belt which hosts numerous large
deposits such as Candelaria (470Mt @ 0.95% Cu, 0.22g/t Au).
The project area has been intermittently explored since the mid-1950 with previous exploration
activity including geological mapping, gridding, stream sediment and soil geochemistry, adit sampling,
plus magnetic, EM and IP geophysical surveys, and diamond drilling at various prospects. Most of the
previous exploration work is regional/greenfields in nature. Compilation and digitization of historical
exploration data is ongoing, and the Company is working up several REE and Cu-Au exploration
targets, with more detail to be provided in future news releases.

About Western Tasmania
Western Tasmania is an established mining region located within a low-risk, stable jurisdiction with
an ongoing, 150-year exploration and mining history. The region has a rich and diverse mineral
resource inventory with large-scale multi-generational mines, established infrastructure, local skilled
labour, and rail-to-port networks. The entire state of Tasmania is supplied by 100% renewable
energy.
About CopperCorp
CopperCorp is a well-financed mineral exploration company with approximately C$6.0M in working
capital as of March 31, 2023 and is exploring in locations that could host world class size copper-
gold deposits in western Tasmania, Australia.
National Instrument 43-101 Disclosure
The Company's disclosure of technical or scientific information related to EL8/2023, the Razorback
Project, in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Sean Westbrook, VP Exploration
for the Company. Mr. Westbrook is a Qualified Person (QP) as defined in National Instrument 43-
101.
The data disclosed in this news release in relation to the Razorback Project is related to historical
exploration results. CopperCorp has not undertaken any independent analysis of the results of the
historical exploration work carried out in order to verify the results. However, the historical results
are considered sufficiently consistent between generations of past explorers and/or past exploration
programs to provide confidence that the results are indicative of the tenor of the samples. In the
professional opinion of the QP, sufficient verification of the data has been undertaken to provide
sufficient confidence that past exploration programs were performed to adequate industry standards
and the data reported is fit for substantiating the prospectivity of the project in general, supporting
the geological model/s proposed, planning exploration programs, and identifying target areas for
further investigation. The Company's current and future exploration work includes verification of the
historical data through new sampling.
TREO (Total Rare Earth Elements) values were calculated by the formula: TREO = CeO2 + La2O3 +
Nd2O3 + Pr6O11 + Sm2O3 + Gd2O3 + Dy2O3 + Eu2O3 + Er2O3 + Tb4O7 + Ho2O3 + Tm2O3 +
Lu2O3 + Yb2O3 + Y2O3.
Standard element to oxide conversion factors have been used in the calculation of rare earth oxide
values from elemental assay values.
This news release also contains information about adjacent properties on which the Company does
not have an interest. Mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby properties is not necessarily
indicative of mineralization hosted on the Razorback Project.
