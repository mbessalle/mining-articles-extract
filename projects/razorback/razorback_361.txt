Preliminary review of EL11/2024 indicates a set of coincident to offset magnetic and residual gravity
anomalies located at the Linda South target, immediately south of the Company's Linda target zone
within EL16/2018 (now renamed Linda North). The magnetic and gravity features are under a thick
(>200m) sequence of barren cover and have never been drill tested although previous surface
exploration has confirmed the presence of zoned hydrothermal alteration in the cover rocks at Linda
South with similar mineralogy to alteration observed the upper and peripheral levels of the Mt Lyell
Cu-Au system. The Company is currently undertaking a technical review of the EL11/2024 and looks
forward to providing further updates upon the anticipated granting of the licence.
EL14/2023 (Granted)
Recently granted Exploration Licence EL14/2023 comprises 28km2 directly adjoining the southern
margin of EL8/2023 (Razorback). The area is considered prospective of IOCG style mineralization
extending southwards under cover from the South Darwin prospect. The licence was granted on
June 27th 2024, and is currently the subject of a historical exploration and technical review.

The construction of drilling access tracks at the Jukes prospect is now complete. Initial drilling is
anticipated to commence early- to mid-September following mobilization of the drill rig to site. An
