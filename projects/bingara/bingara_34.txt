Cosmo’s Chairman, Peter Bird commented: 
“This acquisition represents a transformational moment for Cosmo Metals, providing us with a platform to 
significantly expand our multi-commodity exploration efforts in one of Australia’s most prospective 
emerging regions. The Bingara and Nundle projects are exciting opportunities that align with our strategy 
to unlock value from underexplored, high-potential assets. By combining historical data with modern 
exploration techniques, we are well-positioned to deliver value for our shareholders and advance these 
assets toward their full potential.  The projects containing the highest prospectivity area for antimony in 
NSW, outside of Hillgrove is very exciting for Cosmo, as the global demand and security of supply for 
antimony comes into the spotlight.”   
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT - HISTORICAL EXPLORATION RESULTS  
The historical results presented in this release include exploration results collected between approximately 
1984 - 2008.  
While drilling, sampling protocols and assay QAQC procedures generally match industry standards at the 
time the work was done, they are not consistent with current industry practice required to meet the 2012 
JORC code for reporting of exploration results. As such these results are stated here to provide an 
indication of the exploration potential of the Bingara and Nundle tenements. 
The estimates of the quantity and grade of mineralisation for the Bingara and Nundle tenements referred 
to in this announcement are “historical estimates” within the meaning of the ASX listing rules and are not 
reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012. 
Cosmo notes that a competent person has not done sufficient work to disclose the corresponding 
exploration results in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; it is uncertain that following evaluation and 
further exploration work that the historical estimates will be able to be reported as mineral resources in 
accordance with the JORC Code 2012; it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration 
work that the confidence in the prior reported exploration results may be reduced when reported under 
the JORC Code 2012; that nothing has come to the attention of Cosmo that questions the accuracy or 
reliability of the former owner’s exploration results, but Cosmo is in the process of independently 
validating the previous owner’s exploration results and therefore is not to be regarded as reporting, 
adopting or endorsing those results.  
Cosmo will continue to review and validate the data to enable the results to be reported in accordance 
with the JORC Code 2012.  
The levels of gold and copper reported, from past activities, are a key factor in guiding Cosmo’s exploration 
strategy. The previous activity, which produced these results, involved multiple rounds and styles of 
surface sampling, and drilling.  
The results are considered to have been generated from work programs representing usual industry 
practice for the time they were collected and analysed at commercial laboratories which services the 
mineral exploration industry. In the professional opinion of the Competent Person, Cosmo has, however, 
done sufficient verification of the data, to provide sufficient confidence that drilling, sampling and assays 
were performed to adequate industry standards and is fit for the purpose of planning exploration 
programs and generating targets for further investigation.  
The Competent Person named in this announcement has confirmed that the information in this 
announcement is an accurate representation of the available data.

SUMMARY OF PROJECTS 
Under the Binding Heads of Agreement (HoA) Cosmo is acquiring, subject to shareholder approval, the 
highly prospective Bingara and Nundle projects (the Projects) totalling an area of ~743km2, in the New 
England Orogen of northern NSW.  The New England Orogen hosts the globally significant and nearby 
Hillgrove gold-antimony deposit (1.7Moz AuEq) and the Conrad silver polymetallic deposit (20.7Moz AgEq) 
amongst a range of historic gold, copper, silver and tin production centres (refer Figure 1). 
The Bingara and Nundle Projects represent large, camp scale exploration opportunities with evidence of 
high grade multi commodity mineralisation and contain an extensive pipeline of highly prospective targets 
that are either under explored or completely untested with modern, systematic exploration. 
The Bingara Project, covering a contiguous area of 484.1km2, contains two sub parallel broadly north south 
trending mineralised trends that follow the regional scale Peel Fault system (Figure 2).   
1) The 30 km long Epizonal Orogenic Au (Sb and W) trend – Bingara goldfields 
2) The 20 km long Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) Cu-Au-(Zn) trend 
Portions of the Bingara goldfields have had limited sporadic historic exploration since the late 1970’s, with 
no drilling since 1996, and several areas of historic production having never been drill tested. One area 
that has been subject to shallow exploration drilling, Spring Creek, has returned intersections such as 
(Table 1): 
• 
6.0m at 6.43 g/t Au from 8.0m incl 2.0 m at 17.59 g/t Au from 12.0m (SC17) 
• 
8.0m at 2.83 g/t Au from 1.0m (SC26) 
The 20km long Bingara VMS Cu-Au-(Zn) trend, located east of the Peel Fault, contains six historical Cyprus 
style VMS deposits (Figure 2), including the Mt Everest – Mona Trend, a 2.5km long belt of copper 
occurrences, pits, and mines. The Mt Everest mine, the most significant known VMS deposit in the Bingara 
VMS belt, was worked underground between 1894 and 1908, with two lenses of ore up to 7.0m wide 
(average 3.5 m) developed as discontinuous lenses over a 600 m strike length. Highlights from historic 
sampling include: 
• 
18.6% Cu & 0.6 g/t Au from the supergene zone with malachite and copper oxides 
• 
9.8% Cu from magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite layered rock  
• 
0.3% Cu & 1.05 g/t Au from a sample in banded manganiferous cherts  
This belt has seen no systematic surface exploration, modern geophysics or drill testing.  Elsewhere in the 
world, Cyprus style VMS deposits form modest tonnage, high-grade copper-zinc deposits, that can cluster 
in deposit “camps” and may contain significant gold. 
The Nundle Project, covering an area of 259.1km2 straddling the regional scale Peel Fault (Figure 1), 
contains two key prospective target areas (Figure 4).   
1) A +7.5 km long section of the historic Nundle Epizonal Orogenic gold (antimony) field 
2) The Barnard Hut – Back Barb Cu-Au cluster - Intrusion Related copper target area where historic 
sampling has demonstrated indications of copper mineralisation over a 3 km area 
The Nundle Project is largely underexplored, with most historic work focused on the previously identified 
reefs leaving district scale targets without drilling or modern systematic mapping, sampling, or geophysics.

The 1.7km long Folly Line of gold workings within the Nundle goldfield received limited surface sampling, 
mapping and drilling during 1996 -97 (Figure 5). This drilling returned a peak intersection from The Gap 
Prospect of 5.0m at 5.86 g/t Au from 51m including 1.0m at 17.30 g/t Au (Table 2) in the deepest hole 
drilled, with the hole ending in mineralisation and no follow up drilling completed.  The limited drilling at 
The Gap indicates increasing width and grade of gold mineralisation at depth (Figure 5). 
The Barnard Hut and Back Barb prospects were explored for copper mineralisation between 1970 and 1972 
with limited surface mapping and reconnaissance trenching at Barnard Hut and trenching and an exploration 
adit at Back Barb.  The initial phase of trenching work at Barnard Hut included 376 channel samples from a 
series of trenches that targeted exposed zones of copper mineralisation, returning “strong traces of copper 
mineralisation over a strike length of approximately 2 miles” (approximately 3.2 kms)5, with “multiple zones 
of strong copper mineralisation over a length of 2,000 feet” (approximately 610 m)5.        
Cosmo has committed to fund preliminary exploration activities across the Bingara and Nundle Projects 
during its 60-day exclusivity period. This work includes an innovative drone based geophysical survey at 
Bingara and geological mapping and sampling at Nundle. The completion of these activities during the 
exclusivity period will ensure an efficient and seamless progression of exploration activities upon 
completion of the acquisition. 
NEXT STEPS AND INITIAL EXPLORATION FOCUS 
A Cosmo technical team has completed a site visit as part of its technical due diligence process, further 
validating the exciting exploration targeting work completed by the vendors and ground truthing the 
historic exploration completed by previous explorers at a number of these highly prospective target areas. 
Exploration activities are commencing across the project areas during the 60-day exclusivity period to 
ensure an efficient and seamless progression of exploration activities upon completion of the acquisition. 
During the exclusivity period the Company will fund: 
• 
A Sub Audio Magnetotelluric (SAM) drone survey over the 2.5 km long Mt Everest -Mona VMS trend. 
The survey is aimed at mapping the distribution of conductive ± magnetic anomalies that may 
represent drill targets for concealed massive sulphide and sulphide-magnetite lenses underlying and 
along strike from the historic workings. 
• 
The commencement of drill hole planning and permitting for the initial drill testing of the shallow 
east dipping zone of gold mineralisation at Spring Creek. 
• 
At the Nundle project recent logging of the plantation pine forest that has obscured the goldfield for 
over 50 years has opened up new outcrop and unprecedented access to the Folly Line.  Cosmo will 
initiate the acquisition of new LIDAR coverage over the Folly Line that can be used as a high-
resolution mapping base so that a surface mapping and geochemical program can be completed to 
facilitate the generation of high impact drill targets.

BINGARA PROJECT 
The Bingara Project consists of two contiguous exploration licences, EL 8574 and EL 8800 totalling 
484.1km2. The project contains two sub parallel broadly north south trending mineralised trends that 
follow the regional scale Peel Fault system (Figure 2).

BINGARA EPIZONAL OROGENIC GOLD- ANTIMONY 
The Bingara goldfield is defined by a plus 30 km long belt of hard rock gold (antimony) lodes and alluvial 
workings that were first exploited between 1850 and the 1860’s. Recorded gold production is modest 
however, this is thought to be a small fraction of the overall production, as record keeping during this time 
was poor and alluvial deposits were reported to be rich and developed over large areas1. Small scale 
antimony production is also reported from the Evans and Corrigan mines in the northwest of the project 
and mines in the Hidden Treasure – Spring Creek area1. 
Principal gold trends and lines of lodes within the Bingara tenure include the: 
• 
10.0 km long Whitlow Group 
• 
4.5 km Hidden Treasure – Spring Creek Trend 
• 
3.3 km Specimen Gully – Lone Hand Trend 
• 
1.5 km All Nations Trend  
• 
1.5 km section of the 3.7 km Upper Bingara Trend 
Portions of the Bingara goldfield have had limited sporadic historic exploration by numerous companies 
since the late 1970’s. There has been no drilling of the Bingara goldfield since 1996 and areas like the 
Whitlow Group and Specimen Gully – Lone Hand Trend have never been drill tested.   
The Hidden Treasure – Spring Creek Trend is one area that has received several rounds of shallow 
exploration drilling between 1984 and 1996 (see JORC Table 1).  In total 34 of the 45 holes drilled at Spring 
Creek returned assays of between 0.51 g/t and 17.5 g/t Au. A small non-JORC compliant resource was 
calculated on the basis of this drilling in 19952.  
Mineralisation is related to a shallow east dipping zone of quartz-carbonate veinlets and disseminated 
sulphides localised at the contact between altered basaltic volcanics and carbonaceous shale. Gold 
mineralisation is currently defined by drilling over a 350m north south strike (out of the 4.5 km long Hidden 
Treasure – Spring Creek trend), up to 65m wide zone east west and at a 0.3 g/t Au cut off the mineralised 
zone is between 1.0 m and 14.0 m thick (Figure 3). The mineralisation outcrops on the western side of the 
gold zone and remains open along strike to the north and south and to the east where it has been drill 
tested to a maximum depth of 85 m below surface. 
A selection of better drill intersections from Spring Creek includes (see Table 1): 
• 
6.0m at 6.43 g/t Au from 8.0m incl 2.0 m at 17.59 g/t Au from 12.0m (SC17) 
• 
8.0m at 2.83 g/t Au from 1.0m (SC26) 
• 
6.0m at 2.97 g/t Au from 19.5m incl 3.0 m at 5.51 g/t Au from 19.5m (PDHSC10) 
• 
9.0m at 1.64 g/t Au from 14.0m incl 1.0 m at 5.96 g/t Au from 22m (SC24) 
• 
14.0m at 1.53 g/t Au from 19.0m incl 5.0 m at 2.45 g/t Au from 23m (SCDH3)

BINGARA VOLCANIC MASSIVE SULPHIDE BELT 
The Bingara VMS copper-zinc-gold trend extends over a 20 km north-south strike to the east of the Peel 
Fault and contains six historical Cyprus style VMS Cu-Zn±Au-Ag deposits (Figure 2). This belt of VMS 
deposits continues south of the Bingara Project where similar style VMS deposits are being explored by 
other ASX listed companies.   
At Bingara this belt has seen no systematic surface exploration, modern geophysics or drill testing.  
Elsewhere in the world, Cyprus style VMS deposits form modest tonnage, high-grade copper-zinc deposits, 
that can cluster in deposit “camps” and may contain significant gold, as is the case at Bingara.   
Mt Everest located in the south of the project area within a 2.5km long belt of copper occurrences, pits, 
and mines (that define the Mt Everest – Mona Trend) is the most significant known VMS deposit in the 
Bingara VMS belt. A prominent belt of banded manganiferous-haematitic chert horizons outcrop along the 
western edge of the trend, mapping the extent of the trend and marking the interpreted paleostratigraphic 
top to the VMS system in this area. 
The Mt Everest mine was worked underground between 1894 and 1908, with ore being processed on site 
at a small-scale smelter3.   Mine records show that there were two lenses of ore up to 7.0m wide (average 
3.5m wide) developed as discontinuous lenses over a 600m strike length. The mineralisation was exploited 
in the oxide zone down to the top of the supergene chalcocite zone to a depth of approximately 40m.  This 
suggests that some high-grade supergene and primary sulphide ore may be preserved at depth at the 
deposit. 
Select rock chip samples of the Mt Everest dump material collected by previous explorers hint at the high-
grade nature of the supergene and primary sulphide ore and encouragingly confirm the presence of 
appreciable gold grades. Highlights from historic sampling include: 
• 
18.6% Cu & 0.6 g/t Au from the supergene zone with malachite and copper oxides 
• 
1.4% Cu, 0.4% Zn and 0.2 g/t Au from slate with abundant malachite staining 
• 
9.8% Cu from magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite layered rock  
• 
0.3% Cu & 1.05 g/t Au from a sample in the banded manganiferous cherts indicating that the cherts 
may be mineralised.  
The Mt Everest – Mona trend will be an early focus of exploration for Cosmo at Bingara. During the 60 day 
exclusivity period the Company will fund a SubAudio Magnetotelluric (SAM) drone survey over the 2.5 km 
trend aimed at mapping the distribution of conductive ± magnetic anomalies that may represent drill 
targets for concealed massive sulphide and sulphide – magnetite lenses underlying and along strike from 
the historic workings.

NUNDLE PROJECT 
The Nundle Project consists of a single exploration licence, EL 8692, straddling the regional scale Peel Fault 
(Figure 1).   
The project contains two key prospective target areas (Figure 4).   
1) A plus 7.5 km long section of the historic Nundle Epizonal Orogenic gold (antimony) field  
2) The Barnard Hut – Back Barb Cu-Au cluster - Intrusion Related copper target area where historic 
sampling has demonstrated indications of copper mineralisation over a 3km area

THE NUNDLE GOLDFIELD  
The Nundle goldfield contains epizonal orogenic gold (antimony-tungsten) mineralisation characterised by 
steep dipping lodes and stockwork zones with geochemical signatures similar to the Hillgrove gold-antimony 
(tungsten) mine, located approximately 150km north east of Nundle. Alluvial gold is thought to have been 
first discovered at Nundle in 1849 with lode gold discovered in 18524. The goldfield was worked up to the 
1940’s and although total production from Nundle was not well documented, with over 80 individual lodes 
recorded in the field, production has been estimated to be in excess of 150,000oz of gold4. 
The Nundle Project is divided into two prospective areas, the 1.7km long Folly Line parallel to and within 
the Peel Fault and the Hanging Rock and Tamworth Reefs trend hosted by the Tamworth group sediments 
and diorite bodies (Figure 4). There is evidence of antimony mineralisation associated with these gold 
prospects with recorded production from the Zwer’s Scheelite Mine located 1.7km north of the Folly Line 
of >4.30 t of Sb4. 
The Nundle Project is largely underexplored, with most historic work focused on the previously identified 
reefs leaving district scale targets without drilling or modern systematic mapping, sampling, or geophysics.   
The 1.7km long Folly Line of gold workings received limited surface sampling, mapping and drilling during 
1996 -97 (Figure 5).  A further phase of mine dump sampling was carried out along the Folly Line in 2007 with 
encouraging gold results but no follow-up drilling carried out.

The historic Trevena mine, located at the northern end of the Folly Line, has a number of open cut pits and 
workings (Figure 5). Costean channel sampling completed in 1996 and subsequent rock chip and channel 
sampling in 2007 identified a 350m long section of the trend where 22 of the 48 samples collected range 
from 0.30g/t Au to 11.50 g/t Au averaging 2.16 g/t Au. This zone of mineralisation remains open to the 
south along trend and has not been drill tested. 
Further south along the Folly Line a 500 m long trend of shafts and pits outlines The Gap prospect. In 1996 
an E-W fence of 5 reverse circulation holes, totalling 293 m, was drilled to a maximum depth of 66m along a 
forestry track where it traverses the southern end of the line of workings. The deepest hole to intersect the 
lode assayed 5.0m at 5.86 g/t Au from 51m including 1.0m at 17.30 g/t Au with mineralisation open at end 
of hole (Table 2). This suggests that drilling has not tested the full width of the lode and that the gold zone 
remains open below the current depth of drilling. This limited drilling indicates increasing width and grade of 
gold mineralisation at depth (Figure 5).  There has been no subsequent drilling at The Gap or to the north or 
south of this fence of drill holes.  
Key intercepts from drilling completed along the Folly Line are presented in  
The Folly Line continues for another 600 m to the south of the Gap prospect where sporadic surface sampling 
in the area of the Duke of York mine shows the line is well mineralised, with limited historic drilling appearing 
to have been poorly targeted. 
The Folly Line with be an early focus of Cosmo’s exploration at Nundle.  Recent logging of the planation pine 
forest over the Folly Line area, which has opened up new outcrop, has presented an opportunity to access 
and systematically evaluate the potential of the mineralisation over this 1.7km trend for the first time in over 
50 years.  Cosmo will initiate the acquisition of new LIDAR coverage over the Folly Line that can be used as a 
high-resolution mapping base so that a surface mapping and geochemical program can be completed on 
securing access with the State Forest authority.  This work will facilitate the generation of high impact drill 
targets.   
BARNARD HUT AND BACK BARB COPPER PROSPECT 
Copper mineralisation at these prospects was explored between 1970 and 1972 with limited surface 
mapping and reconnaissance trenching at Barnard Hut and trenching and an exploration adit at Back Barb.  
Additional exploration was carried out in 2008 including project level airborne magnetics and a small soil grid 
over the Back Barb prospect. 
The initial phase of trenching work in 1971 included 376 channel samples from a series of trenches that 
targeted exposed zones of copper mineralisation in the Barnard Hut area. The report notes “strong traces of 
copper mineralisation over a strike length of approximately 2 miles” (approximately 3.2 kms)5. Assay results 
from the trenching indicates “multiple zones of strong copper mineralisation over a length of 2,000 feet” 
(approximately 610 m)5.        
Initial reconnaissance by Cosmo has confirmed the presence of copper mineralisation with supergene 
carbonate and oxide copper, and primary chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite sulphide veinlets in outcrop.  
A program of mapping and sampling will be planned at these prospects to locate the original trench sites and 
confirm the potential prospectivity of the mineralisation at these undertested copper targets.

JORC CODE, 2012 EDITION – TABLE 1 
This Table 1 refers to historic exploration including drilling, rock chip sampling and costean sampling on EL8574 (Bingara), EL8800(All Nations) and EL8692 
(Nundle). 
SECTION 1 SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND DATA 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)

Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and 
the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be 
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m 
samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire 
assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where 
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information.

EL 8692 Nundle 
• 
The Nundle goldfield is a historic mining area with initial discoveries made 
in 1849. Between 1849 and 1944, the goldfield produced some 8,000kg of 
Au from alluvial workings in the Bowling Alley Point, Peel River and Hanging 
Rock fields.  
• 
The exploration and mining techniques employed between 1849 and 1911 
were basic at best, and the application of modern exploration to this aged 
goldfield has a high potential of delineating further economic 
mineralisation along strike and at depth from these proven historic 
deposits. Modern exploration is limited to a shallow RC program 
completed by Caledonian Pacific Minerals N.L, in 1996. Historic Exploration

Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. 
• 
EL 8574, EL 8800 & EL 8692 are located within the New England Fold Belt 
(NEFB) of the Tasman Orogenic system. The NEFB is a complex tectonic 
collage of amalgamated, accreted and fault bound terranes which formed 
as part of the Tasman Orogenic system, a Cambrian to early Ordovician 
extensional accretionary orogen of Gondwana that can be divided into the 
following fault-bound terranes with differing tectonic environments:  
- 
Weraerai Terrane: dismembered ophiolite sequence;  
- 
Gamilaroi Terrane: early Devonian remnant intra-oceanic arc;  
- 
Djungati Terrane: middle–late Devonian subduction complex; and 
- 
Anaiwan Terrane: lower–middle Devonian arc derived 
volcaniclastic sediments.  
• 
Both projects are truncated by the roughly N-S trending Peel Manning Fault 
System (PMFS).  The PMFS is a major west-dipping fault zone, that extends 
over a length of 270 km and represents a major geological structure that 
juxtaposes geological terranes. 
• 
Along the PMFS mineralisation includes gold, mercury, antimony, copper-
gold, magnesite, and veins and podiform chromite.

host bulk tonnage, low-grade gold and fissure vein high grade gold deposits 
and volcanic hosted massive sulphide copper – gold – zinc deposits 
(Mother Lode Systems). 
• 
Mother Lode style mineralisation is an orogenic gold subtype that 
resembles typical Archean orogenic gold deposits that are spatially related 
to well-defined major fault zones, although usually with deposits locally 
situated along second or third order structures.  As a result, such targets 
are typically reasonably large tonnages of relatively low-grade gold but can 
also produce fissure vein hosted lower tonnage high grade deposits. 
• 
At Bingara potential also exists to identify Besshi-Cyprus style volcanic 
hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) deposits formed from the precipitation of 
high sulphur fluids in deep marine volcanic terranes, close to the seawater-
seafloor interface and are potentially economic concentrations of copper, 
zinc and silver mineralisation. 
• 
At Nundle potential also exists to identify subtle ‘Carlin-style’ disseminated, 
sediment-hosted gold within areas of decalcified, calcareous sediments 
identified to the west of the PMFS and epigenetic Cu-Au systems spatially 
associated with altered, Early Devonian intrusives. 
 
EL 8574 and EL 8800 Bingara & All Nations 
• 
At Bingara the PMFS juxtaposes the Gamilaroi Terraine to the west, 
composed of a broadly folded island arc derived sediments, against the 
Weraerai Terrane, of variably schistose and serpentinised ophiolite 
sequence from the strongly deformed and lower greenschist 
metamorphosed. 
• 
The fault-bound Weraerai Terrane is postulated as structurally emplaced 
via strike-slip faulting and serpentinite diapirism in the early Permian.  
Permo-Triassic calc-alkaline volcanics and granitoids postdate 
emplacement of the deformed assemblage and are associated with 
widespread carbonate-fuchsite (listwanite) alteration.  
• 
Listwanite alteration is commonly associated with vein gold deposits,

which, together with less common stockwork and disseminated gold 
deposits, are developed within and immediately to the east and west of 
the serpentinite (Bingara goldfields). 
• 
Gold mineralisation is predominantly hosted by Werarei Terrane 
serpentintes and Djungati Terrane Woolomin Group. However, some 
deposits including the All-Nations gold mine are hosted by sediments of 
the Tamworth group belonging to the Gamilaroi Terrane. 
 
The Hidden Treasure – Spring Creek Trend  
 
• 
The Spring Creek area includes many listed historical gold workings on a 
broad network of veins, or in silicified metasediments and altered 
serpentinite (presumably as disseminations). Mineralisation is related to a 
shallow east dipping zone of quartz-carbonate veinlets and disseminated 
sulphides localised at the contact between altered basaltic volcanics and 
carbonaceous shale. 
• 
Gold mineralisation has been described as coarse disseminations within 
metasediments, with higher grades present in the host metasediments 
rather than the quartz veins that are up to 30 cm thick. 
• 
The mineralisation has not been closed off along strike or down dip, with 
historic workings and soil anomalies continuously encountered along the 
sheared lower basalt contact to the north and south. 
 
Mt Everest 
 
• 
The historical Mount Everest Copper Mine was one of the largest copper 
deposits to be worked out of a number of Besshi-Cyprus Volcanic Hosted 
Massive Sulphide (VHMS) copper discoveries within the Woolomin Beds 
along the eastern edge of the serpentinite belt.

Exposure was generally poor however the reported mapped geology of the 
Prospect area outlined a sequence of predominantly steeply dipping fine-

EL 8692 Nundle 
• 
Within the Nundle project the PMFS separates Woolomin Group, 
comprising Silurian to Devonian siliciclastic and biochemical deep marine 
sediments of the Myra Beds. This unit comprises slate, phyllite, chert, 
jasper, extrusive and intrusive metabasalts and minor lithic wacke from the 
early to middle Devonian Tamworth Group. 
• 
To the west of the Tamworth Group, lying along the western margin of the 
tenement, lie rocks of the Parry Group, which includes rocks of the 
Mandowa Mudstone and Noumea beds, both representing shallow, 
siliciclastic marine environments. 
• 
Structurally emplaced within the Woolomin and Tamworth Groups are 
serpentinites of the Woodsreef Melange. These are Early Cambrian 
schistose, sheared and variously altered serpentinite, gabbro and dolerite. 
Silica- to carbonate-rich hypogene replacement of these serpentinites has 
occurred in the southern portion of the tenement.  
• 
Also structurally emplaced are marine rocks of the Manning Group which 
comprise Early Permian diamictite, conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, 
felsic and intermediate volcanics and limestone. 
• 
Intruded into these rocks are I-type granites of the Clarence River 
Supersuite, comprising calcic and sodic diorites, tonalites and granodiorites 
• 
All economically important gold reefs in the Nundle area occur either 
wholly or partly in doleritic intrusions within the Devonian Tamworth 
Group. These reefs appear to have formed after ultramafic intrusions were 
emplaced, possibly during the late stages of development of the PMFS in 
either the Late Carboniferous or Permian, at shallow depths possibly in a 
geothermal system beneath dry land

The Folly Line 
• 
The geology along the Folly Line is highly variable including massive 
unaltered diorite, mudstone, sandstone and cherts.  
• 
Gold mineralisation occurs as a shear and quartz vein reef system with a 
widespread alteration zone associated with very low-grade gold 
mineralisation.  
• 
Alteration consists of variable silicification, quartz veining, calcsilicate 
alteration, chlorite and sericite alteration (listvenite alteration).  
• 
Minor disseminated pyrite and very minor arsenopyrite are also present 
and associated with the alteration zone.

A summary of all information material to the understanding of the 
exploration results including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drill holes: 
- 
easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
- 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) 
of the drill hole collar 
- 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
- 
down hole length and interception depth 
- 
hole length.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, 
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade 
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used 
• 
Composites for drilling results at Spring Creek and The Folly Line use a 0.3 
g/t Au cut off grade with up to 2 m of internal dilution. Composites at a 
2.0g/t Au cut off grade are also reported for Spring Creek. 
• 
No metal equivalents are reported.

for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of 
such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values 
should be clearly stated. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole 
angle is known, its nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
• 
All drill intercepts are reported as downhole widths.  
• 
Spring Creek 4.5 km N-S mineralised trend. Drilling is orientated 
perpendicular or close to perpendicular the strike of the mineralised trend. 
Mineralisation dips shallowly (20-30 degrees) to the east. Holes have been 
drilled vertically or at -77 to -48 dips to minimise sample bias.  
• 
The Folly Line is a 1.7 km N-S mineralised trend. Drilling is orientated 
perpendicular the strike of the mineralised trend. Mineralisation dips 
steeply to the west at 80-90 degrees.  Drilling has been completed at -60 to 
-45 dips to minimize sample bias. 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of 
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being 
reported. These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of 
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Refer to maps included in this announcement. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not 
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades 
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
See “Cautionary Statement – Historic Data” in the main body of 
announcement 
 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be 
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples 
– size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating substances. 
Nundle 
• 
A magnetics survey was completed by Geoterrex for Caledonian Pacific 
Minerals N.L in 1997 over the Folly Line. The survey used a cesium split-
beam total magnetic sensor with a sampling interval of 0.1 seconds and an 
inflight sensitivity of 0.01 nT. A proton magnetometer with digital recording 
was operated continuously through acquisition with a sample interval of 5 
second and sensitivity of 0.5 nT. The survey was re-processed by RAMA 
geophysics in 2020. A 3D inversion was completed using mGinv3D from 
Scientific Computing and Applications. The inversions were unconstrained.

Barnard Hut & Black Barb  
• 
Copper mineralisation at these prospects was explored between 1970 and 
1972 with limited surface mapping and reconnaissance trenching at 
Barnard Hut and trenching and an exploration adit at Black Barb.  
Additional exploration was carried out in 2008 which included project level 
airborne magnetics and a small soil grid over the Back Barb prospect. 
• 
The initial phase of trenching work in 1971 included 376 channel samples 
from a series of trenches that targeted exposed zones of copper 
mineralisation in Barnard Hut. The report notes “strong traces of copper 
mineralisation over a strike length of approximately 2 miles” 
(approximately 3.2 kms). Assay results from the trenching indicate multiple 
zones of strong copper mineralisation over a length of 2,000 feet 
(approximately 610 m). 
 
• 
See “Exploration done by other parties” for a detailed summary of 
exploration completed by other parties.  
• 
A detailed summary of other substantive exploration data at Bingara and 
Nundle will be reporting following detailed data analysis post Acquisition. 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral 
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, 
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling 
areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. 
• 
Drone operated Sub-Audio Magnetotelluric (SAM) Fixed Loop 
Electromagnetics survey across key targets at Bingara. 
• 
Reconnaissance geological mapping and sampling focused on the Folly Line 
gold workings and Barnard Hut Intrusion Related copper target areas at 
Nundle. 
• 
The commencement of drill hole planning and permitting for the initial drill 
testing of the shallow east dipping zone of gold mineralisation at Spring 
Creek, Bingara. 
• 
Cosmo will initiate the acquisition of new LIDAR coverage over the Folly 
Line at Nundle that can be used as a high-resolution mapping base to 
facilitate the generation of high impact drill targets.
