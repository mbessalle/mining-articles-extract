ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 5th July 2024
$6.5M FARM-IN TO SEARCH FOR TIER 1 DEPOSITS ON PEEL’S
CURNAMONA PROJECT
Peel Mining Ltd (ASX:PEX) (Peel or the Company), is pleased to announce that it has entered into a
Heads of Agreement (Agreement), with Red Hill Minerals Limited (ASX: RHI) (Red Hill), for Red Hill to
farm into and earn a 75% interest in the Curnamona Project through spending $6.5 million on
exploration over a period of up to 5 years. The Curnamona Project, held by Peel’s wholly owned
subsidiary Peel Far West Pty Ltd, comprises the Curnamona tenements in New South Wales and the
Anabama tenement in South Australia. Following the completion of the farm-in period the companies
will form a joint venture.
Highlights
• The Curnamona tenements in New South Wales, host to the highly prospective Wilyama
Supergroup and occurrences of interpreted Broken Hill Type mineralisation1, are considered
prospective for Tier 1 zinc-lead-silver deposits.
• The Anabama tenement in South Australia is located within the under-explored Boucaut
Volcanics of the Adelaide Fold-thrust Belt and contains the namesake Anabama prospect,
which is an outcropping Cu (Au, Co) deposit.
• Red Hill Minerals may earn a 75% interest in the Curnamona Project by spending $6.5 million
on exploration over the farm-in period of up to five years.
• Red Hill Minerals has committed to spend a minimum $1.5 million of expenditure within the
first two years, prior to withdrawal, subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent.
• Upon earning a 75% interest in the Project, a 75% RHI:25% PEX JV will be formed.
• The Curnamona Project tenements cover over 1,460 km² in the Broken Hill provenance of New
South Wales and in South Australia.
Technical Director, Rob Tyson Commented:
“In recent years, Peel has assembled a major land position in the Curnamona with the view that the
prospective rocks have potential to host a Tier 1 deposit, akin to the giant Broken Hill lead-zinc-silver
orebody. Previous limited historic drilling at the Curnamona tenements has intercepted occurrences of
Broken Hill type mineralisation, an indication of the potential that could be lurking beneath the cover.
The Anabama tenement in South Australia contains the underexplored namesake Anabama copper
prospect and here Peel sees good potential for the discovery of a large scale, near surface copper
deposit.
We are very pleased to welcome Red Hill Minerals as our strategic partner to explore these highly
prospective Broken Hill tenements, along with advancing a proven copper target at Anabama. We
welcome Red Hill Mineral’s willingness to make a substantial investment in exploration on these
tenements with an aim of discovering a major mineral deposit.

Figure 1 Curnamona Project JV Tenure
The Curnamona Project
The Curnamona Project contains more than 1,400km2 of tenure straddling New South Wales and
South Australia. The tenement package is considered highly prospective for Copper, Gold, Cobalt, Zinc,
Lead, Silver and Uranium. Economic mineralisation is predominantly known to occur within the
Broken Hill and Thackaringa Groups with the bulk of historic exploration in the region focussed on
the outcropping areas east of the Mundi Mundi fault. Limited exploration beneath the Mundi Mundi
Plains (due to cover) has yielded numerous significant results. The Anabama Prospect (in South
Australia) is seen as prospective for large scale, open-pittable Cu (Au, Co) resources with an existing
non JORC compliant resource estimate of 4.2Mt at 0.52% Copper historically reported by Placer
Exploration Ltd2.
