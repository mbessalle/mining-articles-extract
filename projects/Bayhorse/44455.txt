# Bayhorse Adds Idaho Claims to The Bayhorse Property

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - November 20, 2023) - **Bayhorse Silver Inc, (TSXV:  BHS) (OTCQB: BHSIF) (FSE: 7KXN) (the "Company" or "Bayhorse")** has added additional claims in Idaho to its Bayhorse Silver Mine Property, Oregon, USA.

The new claims extend over 1.6 km (1 mile) east from the Bayhorse Mine across the Snake River into Idaho along a south-east trend that historic geological mapping (Figure 1) shows the presence of silver-hosting rhyolite. Historic mine workings and known silver-bearing mineralization are present in the new claims area.

Hercules Silver has recently discovered a copper porphyry deposit associated with a red schist conglomerate at one of its properties lying approximately 40 km (26 miles) north-northeast of the Bayhorse Mine (Figure 2 below). Hercules has acquired a second property 24 km (14 miles) NE of Bayhorse. A conglomerate, similar to that on the Hercules ground is present adjacent to the silver-bearing rhyolite on the Bayhorse Property, prompting the extension of the new claims into Idaho.

The Bayhorse and Hercules Silver properties have similar geological settings and silver mineralization, including significant copper, antimony, and zinc credits. This has spurred Bayhorse to extend further the known silver bearing zones.

An airborne deep penetrating VTEM survey is planned over the entire Bayhorse claims in both Idaho and Oregon to determine whether an anomaly is present that could indicate the presence of both high-grade silver and a porphyry copper deposit. 

Drs. Ray and Conway are currently assessing the Bayhorse Mine structure and geology to determine how best to test the extensive historic underground workings to depth for any underlying mineralization below the known mineral horizon.
