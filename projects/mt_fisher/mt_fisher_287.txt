12 months, representing ~17% of the tradeable shares pre-placement that are escrowed for a
further 12 months.

High-Tech Metals Limited (ASX: HTM) (“High-Tech”, “HTM” or the “Company”) is pleased to advise that
it has entered into a legally binding term sheet (“Term Sheet”) to acquire 100% of Rox Resources
Limited’s (ASX:RXL) (“RXL”) interest in the Mt Fisher Gold Project and acquire 51% of the Mt Eureka Gold
Project, (together, the “Project”) in the highly prospective Northern Goldfields region, Western Australia
(Figure 2). Completion under the Term Sheet is subject to certain conditions precedent outlined below,
including necessary shareholder approvals which the Company is proposing to seek at an upcoming
general meeting planned to be held in early April 2025 (“General Meeting”).
High-Tech’s CEO, Warren Thorne, commented:
“I am delighted to announce the proposed acquisition of the Mt Fisher and Mt Eureka Projects to HTM
shareholders. The opportunities for serious and sustained growth are exceptional and will position the
Company as a gold exploration and development business. It will allow us to conduct year-round,
high-impact exploration activities with the use of our exceptional technical team.
“The Projects are in a highly prospective and active mining district, the Northern Goldfields of Western
Australia, which has demonstrated time and again its prospectivity for high grade gold and base
metals discoveries. Our high-level geological review work by our technical team has already identified
several walk-up drill targets which have potential to substantially add to the gold resources already in
place. High-Tech will begin a significant drilling program, which will provide consistent and exciting
news flow for shareholders in 2025.”
Rox Resources CEO, Phillip Wilding, commented:
“We are pleased to have reached agreement with HTM to sell our non-core asset, Mt Fisher, in line with
our strategy to advance our flagship 2.3Moz Youanmi Gold Project through DFS.
“This agreement follows an extensive negotiation process with HTM to acquire the Mt Fisher tenements.
“Mt Fisher is a highly prospective tenement package, and we believe HTM is well-positioned to drive
value and take the project forward.
“The sale of Mt Fisher would realise significant value for Rox shareholders by strengthening our balance
sheet and retaining significant exposure to future upside through the HTM shares and 1% NSR royalty.”
Mt Fisher and Mt Eureka Gold Project
The Project is in the Northern Goldfields, approximately 500km northeast of Kalgoorlie and 120km east
of Wiluna within the Mt Fisher greenstone belt which is located 40km east of the prolific Yandal
greenstone belt, host of significant gold deposits including Jundee, Bronzewing and Milrose (Figure
2). The total consolidated land package is 1,150 km2. The Project is held by RXL 100% for certain tenure
(which includes the gold rights on tenure held by Cannon Resources Pty Ltd) with the remaining tenure
held by Rox and Cullen Resources Limited (“Cullen”) (ASX: CUL) in a joint venture, with RXL earning up
to 75% (currently 51%; Appendix 1; Figure 2).
The Project offers significant exploration upside, with multiple highly prospective targets at depth and
along strike from existing resources, which support the plan to grow the mineral resource further and
will be a focus of exploration drilling by the Company. All information provided has been taken from
historic reports written by independent consultants for the previous owners of the Project.

Figure 1- Image looking north-west showing historical pit, waste dumps and tailings storage facility.
Historic exploration has been largely fragmented, non-systematic and conducted by numerous
companies since the 1980’s. A large proportion of historic exploration has focussed on nickel along the
eastern margin of the Project area, which resulted in Cannon Resources’ JORC 2012 MRE of 7.5Mt @
1.8% Ni for 134.1Kt of contained nickel metal. The Project area is primarily prospective for gold,
however, potential also exists for Ni mineralisation (Figure 3). Notwithstanding the nature of the historic
exploration significant gold mineralisation was intersected by AC and RAB drilling deep within the
weathering profile and by RC and diamond drilling in fresh rock below 100m depth (Figures 4 to 7 and
Appendix 2).
Mineral Resources
The Project’s gold resource comprises five separate gold deposits: Damsel, Mt Fisher Mine and Wagtail
for 124koz on Rox 100% tenements, and Taipan and Southern for 63koz on Mt Eureka joint venture
tenements (Figure 3). The total Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource for the Mt Fisher – Mt Eureka
Gold Project now stands at 3.5Mt @ 1.65g/t Au for 187koz of contained gold (Table 1 and refer RXL ASX
Announcement 2nd November 2022 Mt Fisher-Mt Eureka Gold Resource Increased 110% to 187koz).
The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the
information included in this announcement and all material assumptions and technical parameters
underpinning the Mineral Resource Estimate included in this announcement continue to apply and
have not materially changed.
Previous mining at the Mount Fisher by Sundowner Minerals produced 30,000ozs of gold 218,000t @
4.43g/t Au between 1987 and 1989.

Figure 2 - Mt Fisher and Mt Eureka Gold Project Location Plan.

Geology and Mineralisation
The Mt Fisher – Mt Eureka Gold Project is located within the Mt Fisher greenstone belt, which is situated
in the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia (Figure 2).
The greenstone belt is about 70km long and 20km wide and straddles the Kurnalpi – Burtville Terrane
boundary, with the boundary transecting the greenstone belt. This major NNW trending structure
(Hootanui Shear) is potentially a deep-seated gold plumbing conduit. The Archaean geology in the
Project area comprises a north to northwest striking greenstone sequence. The greenstone sequence
comprises refolded tholeiitic to high magnesium basalts with numerous dolerite to gabbroic intrusives
and lesser felsic volcaniclastics, intrusives, interflow sediments and talc-chlorite ultramafics.
Gold mineralisation occurs at several sites, most notably at the Dam-Damsel Gold Trend, Mt Fisher Mine,
Wagtail, Taipan and Southern Prospects (Figure 3). The Dam-Damsel Gold Trend is defined by strong
gold and multi-element anomalism (Sb, As, Bi, Cu, and Zn) over 10km of strike within a well-defined
structural corridor on the western limb of the Wonganoo Anticline. Mineralisation trends in a north-south
orientation and is interpreted to be channelled along the bounding Dam and Dirks shear zones and
particularly through an anastomosing network of linking structures between these major shears.
The geology of the Damsel prospect comprises a package of north-south striking, strongly foliated
tholeiitic to chloritic basalts intruded by felsic porphyries and dolerite/gabbro. The regolith is well
developed over the area, increasing towards the north to depths of over 100m (Figures 4 and 5). Higher
gold grades within the regolith are located along the upper/lower saprolite interface which is likely
due to supergene enrichment. Primary gold mineralisation occurs in stacked parallel lenses that dip
west and plunge moderately north. Mineralisation is associated with highly sheared silica-sericite-
carbonate altered basalts with pyrite and chalcopyrite.
The historic Mt Fisher Mine is located on a neighbouring structural corridor approximately 8km NE of the
Dam-Damsel gold trend (Figure 6). The Mt Fisher gold deposit is hosted within a sulphide facies chert,
bounded by a strongly foliated chloritic ultramafic hanging wall and a basaltic footwall. The sequence
strikes north-northeast and dips to the east at approximately 50°. Gold mineralisation occurs in
association with massive and disseminated sulphides, mainly pyrrhotite, with lesser pyrite. Mineralisation
plunges moderately southwards beneath the southern end of the existing open pit and is open at
depth.
The Wagtail prospect (also known as Moray Reef) is a quartz vein hosted gold reef system. Historic
production from the deposit between 1949 and 1952 produced a reported 2,384 ounces at an
average grade of 66 g/t Au. The reef strikes north, with a sub-vertical to steep easterly dip. High-grade
mineralisation plunges moderately north (Figure 6).
The Mt Eureka gold prospects are situated along a 15km long zone of sheared and anomalous
greenstone rocks. Four deposits (Taipan, Eureka North-West, Southern-Galway and Graf’s Find) are the
main gold occurrences and have been the focus of drilling and exploration. The Taipan shear zone is
a large hydrothermal system in a complex structural setting. The mineralised system has a strike length
of 700m and a true thickness of up to 150m and consists of sheared chlorite-quartz-biotite-carbonate
schist containing moderately abundant fine disseminated pyrite (Figure 7). Mineralisation at the
Southern and Galway prospects occurs within silicified shear zones developed on a northeast striking,
northwest dipping contact between felsic volcaniclastic schist and ultramafic schist.

Drilling Techniques
Where recorded by previous explorers, RC drilling was carried out using a face-sampling hammer.
Various drilling contractors were used over the years. RC drilling by RXL was carried out with a 140mm
face sampling hammer. Most historical diamond drilling was undertaken using an NQ diameter bit.
Diamond drilling completed by RXL was undertaken using a combination of HQ and NQ2 diameter
bits. Pre-collars for diamond holes were drilled using 140mm face sampling RC hammer. RC and
diamond down-hole surveys were completed using north-seeking gyroscopes.
Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques
Historical RC samples were collected every metre via a cyclone into a plastic bag prior to splitting with
a Jones riffle splitter. A 1.5-3kg sample split was collected into a calico bag for laboratory submission.
Historical diamond drill core was cut using a diamond saw into half-core or, in the case of HQ diameter
core into ¼ core and sampled on either a 1m basis or over geological intervals to a maximum of 1m.
Historically, information relating to sample recovery and quality, while often noted on logs, was not
always well documented.
RC drillholes were sampled on 1m intervals collected via a cyclone, dust collection system and cone
splitter. Through target zones 1m samples were taken and dispatched to the lab. The remainder of the
hole was sampled using 4m composite samples. For 4m composite samples that returned gold grades
greater than 0.2 g/t Au the corresponding 1m calicos were sent for analysis.
RXL diamond core is dominantly NQ2 size, sampled on geological intervals, with a minimum of 0.2 m
up to a maximum of 1.2 m. HQ and NQ2 holes were cut in half, with one half sent to the laboratory and
one half retained.
Sample Preparation and Assaying
Assaying methodology and laboratories have varied over the years with several historical operators.
Standard industry practice sampling, preparation and assaying best practises were used at the time.
The typical analytical technique was fire assay fusion and detection by atomic absorption
spectrometry.
RXL RC and diamond core samples from 2021 were sent to Intertek Genalysis in Kalgoorlie, crushed to
10mm, dried and pulverised (total prep) in LM5 units (Some samples > 3kg were split) to produce a sub-
sample. Pulps were analysed by 50g Fire Assay with ICP-OES (Intertek code FA50/OE). RC and diamond
core samples from drilling in 2022 were sent to ALS Kalgoorlie, crushed to 10mm, dried and pulverised
(total prep) in LM5 units (Some samples > 3kg were split) to produce a sub-sample. RC and diamond
pulps were analysed by 50g Fire Assay with ICP-OES (ALS code AU/AA26), and diamond pulps were
selectively assayed by ME-MS61.
Estimation Methodology
The full Mt Fisher – Mt Eureka database as supplied contained 10,308 drill holes in total for a total of
579,642m; the complete assay file contained 158,677 sample intervals. The data set was split into five
subsets covering the five deposits (Damsel, Mt Fisher Mine, Wagtail, Taipan and Southern; Table 2)
which have been modelled. The subsets of data for each area were used to generate mineralised
domains, either by categorical indicator modelling of grades, the Implicit Modelling functions in
Micromine 2022.5 or a combination of both methods.

The Mineral Resources have been classified in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories in
accordance with the JORC Code, 2012 Edition. Classification is based on a combination of drill spacing
and kriging output parameters and preliminary pit optimisations have been carried out to determine
likely future ultimate pit limits. Material outside these limits has been excluded from the resource
classification.
Probability plots and histograms were used to confirm that domaining produced consistent data sets
and to generate top cuts. All assay data at each deposit was composited to 1m intervals prior to
statistical analysis and resource estimation. Analysis was undertaken for composite data inside the
mineralisation wireframes. High grade cuts (top cuts) were applied that ranged from 9 g/t Au to 70 g/t
Au (Table 3).

Table 3 - Block model interpolation, Top cuts.
The modelling technique uses an Ordinary Kriging methodology, which is considered appropriate for
the type of deposits being estimated. Block sizes vary deposit and are summarised in Table 4 below.
Table 4- Block model interpolation, deposit block sizes.
Block model validation was carried out in several ways, including visual inspection on sections, long
sections and plans, and in 3D, model vs composite statistics, swathe plot validation with all validation
methods producing reasonable results.
The Mineral Resource was classified as Indicated or Inferred based on the level of geological
understanding of the mineralisation and the drill hole spacing. Drill hole sample spacing was the
primary metric. In general, Measured material typically has a drill spacing of 20m or closer; Indicated
material is confined to areas where resource definition drilling is 20m to 40m or 50m spacing; Inferred
material is usually in the range of 50m to 75-80m.
Mining and Metallurgical Methods
Mining of all deposits as modelled is expected to be by conventional open pit mining methods and
this is reflected in the choice of block sizes. The prospects for eventual economic extraction have been
evaluated by carrying out pit optimisations using appropriate mining and processing costs and gold
prices. Parts of the resource models which are not included in open pit optimal shells or where drill
spacing is greater than 100m are excluded from the Mineral Resource Estimate. No assumptions have
been made about metallurgical factors.
Consideration for the Acquisition
High-Tech will acquire 100% of RXL’s Mt Fisher Gold Project and a 51% interest in the Mt Eureka Gold
Project for the following consideration payable to RXL:
• HTM to issue RXL 1,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares in HTM (“Consideration Shares”), which RXL
has agreed to enter into voluntary escrow for 12 months from issue.

Exploration done by
other parties | • Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other
parties. | A number of companies have completed exploration for base metals and gold within the regional
Mt Fisher area. These companies include Minops Pty Ltd (1968 to 1971), Tenneco Australia (1971
to 1973), Sundowner (1985 to 1989), ACM Gold Ltd (1988 to 1992), Aztec Mining Company Ltd
(1993 to 1994) and Pegasus Gold Australia Pty Ltd (1994 to 1996).
Work conducted included aeromagnetic surveys, ground magnetic surveys, regional mapping, rock
chip sampling, soil geochemistry (including BLEG and stream sediment sampling) and rotary air blast
(RAB) drilling.
The Mt Fisher deposit was first discovered in 1936 and mining between 1937 and 1949 produced

approximately 4,500 tonnes of ore at 28 g/t gold (Powell, 1990). In 1980, a small deposit was
defined by percussion drilling around the historical workings. Further drilling from 1984 to 1986
defined a larger deposit to the south of the old workings with Sundowner acquiring a 100% interest
in the project in January 1986.
Sundowner completed a historic estimate of 252,000 tonnes at 5.4 g/t gold to a pit depth of 100 m.
Following a period of study, a 250,000 tpa carbon-in-pulp treatment plant was built with completion
in September 1987. Open pit mining commenced in April 1987 and continued through to September
1988, and processing finished in late November 1988. Total production from the Mt Fisher open pit
was reportedly 218,000 tonnes at 4.3 g/t gold.
Following completion of treatment, the plant was dismantled and moved to Sundowner’s Darlot
mine 140 km to the south (Leandri P.S., 1989. Mt Fisher Mt Fisher Mine Eod of Operations Report.

Norgold Ltd and BHP Ltd (BHP) conducted gold exploration in the same area in the 1980s and
exploration included rock chip sampling and mapping. BHP followed up with RAB and RC drilling
reporting several gold anomalies in what was later named the Dam prospect.
From 1993 to 1997, CRAE completed extensive exploration with work largely focusing on the Dam
prospect where gold anomalism was identified over a 7 km by 1 km area. Work completed included
RAB and aircore (AC) drilling with a small amount of RC and diamond drilling follow-up. Delta
acquired the Project in 1998 and explored it until 2001. They completed additional RAB, AC, RC and
diamond drilling. CRAE and Delta defined extensive regolith gold anomalies but were unable to
identify any substantial bedrock sources to gold mineralisation.
From 1996, Cullen Resources NL (Cullen) in joint venture with Newmont Mining Corporation
(Newmont) conducted exploration in the Mt Eureka area for gold and were also involved in a
nickel joint venture with BHP.
Avoca Resources Ltd (Avoca) acquired the Mt Fisher Gold Project in 2004 and completed geological
mapping and soil and rock chip sampling over much of the tenement area. Drilling was focused on
defining further mineralisation along the Dam- Damsel-Dirk gold corridor and extending known
mineralisation at Moray Reef, with the internal reporting of Mineral Resources for both the Dam and
Moray Reef prospects. From 2004 to 2011, Avoca completed a total of 158 RAB/AC drill holes for
9,111 m and 64 shallow RC drill holes for 5,188 m.

defined by percussion drilling around the historical workings. Further drilling from 1984 to 1986
defined a larger deposit to the south of the old workings with Sundowner acquiring a 100% interest
in the project in January 1986.
Sundowner completed a historic estimate of 252,000 tonnes at 5.4 g/t gold to a pit depth of 100 m.
Following a period of study, a 250,000 tpa carbon-in-pulp treatment plant was built with completion
in September 1987. Open pit mining commenced in April 1987 and continued through to September
1988, and processing finished in late November 1988. Total production from the Mt Fisher open pit
was reportedly 218,000 tonnes at 4.3 g/t gold.

Person. For example, the application of statistical or
geostatistical procedures to quantify the relative accuracy of
the resource within stated confidence limits, or, if such an
approach is not deemed appropriate, a qualitative discussion
of the factors that could affect the relative accuracy and
confidence of the estimate.
• The statement should specify whether it relates to global or
local estimates, and, if local, state the relevant tonnages,
which should be relevant to technical and economic
evaluation. Documentation should include assumptions made
and the procedures used.
• These statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the
estimate should be compared with production data, where
available. | The relative accuracy of the various resource estimates is reflected in the JORC resource categories.
At the Measured and Indicated resource classification levels, the resources represent local
estimates that can be used in further mining studies.
Inferred resources are considered global in nature.
