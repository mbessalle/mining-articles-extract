Mt Fisher Wagtail
Deposit (Mining Lease)
• Active Mining Lease M53/0009 over existing resource of
63,700 @ 7.11g/t Au for 14,600 oz
• Quartz vein hosted gold reef system with historic 1949 -
1952 produced a reported 2,384oz @ average 66 g/t
Au.
• High-grade mineralisation plunges moderately north
and geological continuity of the mineralised structure
continues along strike and down dip.
• Historical drill results include:
• 5m @ 41.13g/t Au from 44m,
incl 3m @ 67.94g/t Au from 45m
• 3m @ 55.14g/t Au from 47m,

• Priority drill target to extend mineralisation and test for
parallel gold zones

resource outline, and significant assays over TMI.

Damsel Deposit
Exploration Upside
• Existing resource of 1.4Mt @ 2.20g/t Au for 74,800 oz
• Damsel is located within a 1 km long gold anomaly (in
regolith) defined by grades greater than 1 g/t Au. This area is
part of a broader 7km long gold anomaly (>0.2g/t Au).
• Mineralisation trends in a north-south orientation and is
interpreted to be channelled along the bounding Dam and
Dirks shear zones (Figure 11 inset).
• Potential of the Damsel prospect which features large-scale
gold anomalies and many of the geological features of
major gold systems in the Yilgarn.
• Damsel results provide a clear demonstration of the high gold
grades and strong continuity at depth.
• Historical drill results include:
• 11m @ 2.7g/t Au from 40m (MFRC098) incl 4m @ 6.0g/t
Au from 45m
• 18m @ 6.99g/t Au from 69m (MFRC081) from 74m incl
10m @ 10.27g/t Au Figure 5. Location plan of the Damsel gold prospect showing gt>0.50g/t Au drill intersections, resource
outline, and significant assays over TMI.

Mt Eureka
Taipan Deposit
• The Mt Eureka Gold prospects are situated along a
15km long zone of sheared and anomalous
greenstone rocks, with prospects Taipan and
Southern-Galway having the main gold
occurrences
• The Taipan shear zone is a large hydrothermal
system in a complex structural setting (Figure 16).
• The mineralised system has a strike length of 700m
and a true thickness of up to 150m.
• High grade gold mineralisation within the north
portion of the deposit with intercepts of:
• 20m @ 2.28g/t Au from 100m, including 2m @
9.85g/t Au from 102m in MERC022 and
• 1m @ 17.4g/t Au in MEAC03 (RXL ASX Release
26 October 2021).
Figure 6. Location plan of the Taipan gold prospect showing gt>0.50g/t Au drill intersections, resource
outline, and significant assays over TMI..

Mt Eureka
Southern-Galway Deposit (South)
• Mineralisation at the Southern and Galway prospects occurs
within silicified shear zones (Figure 19).
• A thick zone of high-grade gold mineralisation at Galway
was intersected near-surface in MFRC075 and indicates the
potential for continuity of high-grade mineralisation within
the interpreted northeast trending structure
• 13m @ 6.81g/t Au from 45m, including 9m @ 8.89g/t Au
from 47m and 4m @ 2.59g/t Au from 67m at Galway.
• 3m @ 3.96g/t Au from 35m at the Southern Prospect
(MFRC071)
• Mineralisation open in all directions along NE-SW trend.
• Structurally complex zone with numerous sub-parallel high-
grade zones

Production Potential
Former Mine & New Pits
• Given the current strength in the price of the gold price
and the projects proximity to hungry mills, the Company
will immediately engage expert mining consultants and
begin negotiations with mining contractors.
• The Company will assess the production and restart
potential at The Mt Fisher Gold Mine, a former producing
gold mine (30,000 ounces of gold @ 4.3 g/t Au) and the
remaining deposit is 464kt @ 2.32g/t Au for 34,700oz.
• The Company will immediately engage mining
consultants and mine engineers to run pit optimisations
across near surface shallow oxide pits that may be
amendable to profitable gold mining operations and
production.
• The Wagtail deposit (historical production of 2,384oz @
66 g/t Au) has an active mining lease and significant
grade within the existing resource of 63,700 @ 7.11g/t Au
for 14,600oz.

Mt Fisher/Mt Eureka Mineral Resources
The Mineral Resources have been classified in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories in accordance with the
JOCR Code, 2012 Edition. Classification is based on a combination of drill spacing and kriging output parameters and
preliminary pit optimisations have been carried out to determine likely future ultimate pit limits. Material outside these limits
has been excluded from the resource classification.
The resources at each deposit and in total have been reported at a 0.5 g/t gold cutoff, as presented in Tables 2 to 6.
