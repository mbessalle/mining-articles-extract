ASX:SBR ANNOUNCEMENT``
Golden Deeps Expands Footprint in the World-Class Lachlan Fold
Belt Copper-Gold Province, NSW
Golden Deeps Ltd (ASX: GED) has entered into a binding Heads of Agreement (HOA) to earn an 80%
interest in the holders of four granted and highly-prospective exploration licences in the world-
class Lachlan Fold Belt Copper-Gold Province of NSW (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).
• Under the HOA with Acros Minerals Pty Ltd (Acros) and Crown Gold Resources Pty Ltd (Crown),
Golden Deeps will reimburse $179,263 previous exploration expenditure, and earn an 80% interest
by spending $300,000 on exploration within three years (see Significant Terms, Appendix 1).
• The Acros and Crown tenements in the Lachlan Fold Belt straddle the boundary between the
Siluro-Devonian Hill End Trough - which hosts the Hill End and Hargreaves goldfields (2Moz
historic production1) - and the Rockley-Gulgong Volcanic Belt, which is highly prospective for
porphyry copper-gold deposits (see Figure 1). Major deposits in the Lachlan Fold Belt include
the world-class Cadia-Ridgeway deposit (456Mt @ 0.83 g/t Au, 0.24% Cu endowment2).
• Golden Deeps is currently drilling at the Havilah Copper-Gold Project (EL8936) within the
Rockley-Gulgong Volcanic Belt to test a series of porphyry/volcanics hosted copper-gold targets
at the Hazelbrook prospect3 (see location, Figure 1 and magnetics with key targets, Figure 2).
• Targets within the Acros (EL9114, EL9069 & EL9118) and Crown (EL9060) tenements include:
- Extensions of the Sofala Volcanics south of the Havilah Project. Magnetics indicate
continuity of the highly-prospective volcanics and intrusives which project south under
Permian cover into EL9114. No previous work has tested the underlying volcanics and/or
the intrusive boundary (see Figures 1 and 2).
- Extensions of the Rockley-Gulgong belt along the Mudgee Fault (Figure 1), which includes
the mineralised Sofala Volcanics and buried porphyry intrusion targets, into EL9069 and
EL9060 north of the Havilah tenement (see Figures 1 and 2).
- Extensions of the Hargreaves and Tuckers Hill high-grade gold trends north into EL9118
(see Figure 1).
• The Company will build on previous work which has shown that the mineralised Sofala Volcanics
and porphyry Cu-Au targets are present on EL9114 and EL9069. Planned work includes further
geophysical surveys (detailed gravity, magnetics & Induced Polarisation), with a focus on
extensions of the Rockley-Gulgong belt south and north of the Company’s projects (Figure 2).
• This work will aim to define drilling targets targeting major porphyry/volcanics hosted copper-
gold deposits in an area which has received limited exploration due to shallow cover.
Golden Deeps CEO Jon Dugdale commented:
“This HOA gives Golden Deeps access to extensions of mineralised volcanics and intrusives within the
Rockley-Gulgong Volcanic Belt. This belt is highly prospective for major porphyry/volcanic hosted copper-
gold discoveries and is a similar setting to major deposits such as the world-class Cadia-Ridgeway mine.
“The Acros and Crown tenements also include extensions to the Hill End gold corridor which has produced
over two million ounces of gold.
“We now look forward to immediately advancing geophysical programs to define drilling targets south and
northwest of the Company’s Havilah Project, where drilling is currently testing copper-gold targets which
continue under cover into the Acros and Crown ground.”

About the Acros and Crown Tenements
Acros holds three exploration licences (EL9114, EL9069 and EL9118) and Crown one exploration licence
(EL9060) near Mudgee in the Eastern Lachlan Fold Belt region of NSW (see Figure 1 for locations). Details
of the tenements are shown in Table 1 below:

Company Tenement Grant Expiry Area (Km2) Commitment p.a.
Acros Minerals Pty Ltd EL9114 15/03/2021 15/03/2027 74 $25,000
Acros Minerals Pty Ltd EL9069 2/03/2021 2/03/2027 143 $20,000
Acros Minerals Pty Ltd EL9118 16/03/2021 16/03/2027 179 $25,000
Crown Gold Resources Pty Ltd EL9060 18/02/2021 18/02/2027 65 $25,000
461 $95,000
The Acros and Crown tenements are located close to the eastern margin of the Lachlan Fold Belt and
straddle the boundary between the Siluro-Devonian Hill End Trough - which contains the Hill End gold
field (2Moz produced), and the Rockley-Gulgong Volcanic Belt which is highly prospective for porphyry
related copper-gold deposits (see Figure 1).
In the eastern tenements (EL9114, EL9069 and EL9060), the Company is targeting porphyry/volcanic
hosted copper-gold mineralisation in a belt of Ordovician age (Sofala) volcanic rocks in the Rockley-
Gulgong Volcanic Belt. This belt is part of the Macquarie Arc in the Lachlan Fold Belt - a major geological
province known for world-class copper-gold deposits such as Cadia-Ridgeway2 and North Parkes4 (see
Figure 3, below). These major deposits are hosted by Ordovician volcanic rocks and associated with
“porphyry” intrusives and sit within parallel volcanic belts to the west of the Rockley-Gulgong Belt.

Projects, and the Company’s Havilah Project (adapted from Portergeo.com.au2,4).
The Acros EL9114 tenement adjoins Golden Deeps’ Havilah tenement where the Company is drill-testing
copper-gold sulphide targets associated with large, sub-surface Induced Polarisation (IP) geophysical
anomalies and surface soil and rockchip geochemical anomalies5. These targets are associated with
the highly-prospective Ordovician Sofala Volcanics close to the northeastern margin of the Aaron’s Pass
Granite/porphyry complex (see Figure 2). The surface mineralisation on the Havilah tenement occurs
within the magnetic aureole of the Aarons Pass Granite. Magnetics imagery indicates the mineralised
magnetic Sofala Volcanics pass under Permian cover to the south of EL8936 and into the Acros
tenement EL9114 – where they have not been tested. Detailed gravity and IP surveys are planned to
detect sub-surface Cu-Au porphyry sulphide targets prior to drill targeting.
The Rockley-Gulgong Volcanic Belt also continues to the northwest of the Havilah tenement, into the
Acros EL9069 tenement and Crown’s EL9060. Magnetics indicate the presence of sub-surface porphyry
intrusions intruding magnetic volcanics in both tenement areas (see Figure 2), and surface stream
sediment geochemistry shows elevated Cu within this corridor. Further detailed geophysics (magnetics,
gravity and IP) and surface geochemical programs will be carried out prior to drill targeting.
The region is also prospective for epitherml silver deposits, such as the Bowdens Siklvr Project located
Also in the region is the

The Acros EL9118 tenement is located in the Hill End Trough sedimentary basin and covers projected
extensions of the Hill-End – Hargreaves and Tuckers Hill gold mineralised corridors (Figure 1). The Hill
End goldfield produced approximately two million ounces of gold from orogenic quartz-vein hosted
deposits within folded Devonian-aged sediments of the Hill End Trough6.
Golden Deeps’ EL9014 tenement includes the Tucker Hill gold prospect, where stacked high-grade gold
bearing quartz veins are targeted. The Tuckers Hill project is at the northern end of Vertex Minerals Ltd’s
(ASX:VTX) Hill End Gold Project which has a Mineral Resource of 4.21Mt at 3.6 g/t Au (483,000oz
contained gold)6. The Hargreaves and Tuckers Hill trends continue to the north of EL9014 into EL9118
and are associated with historical gold workings which have not been tested by modern exploration
(Figure 1). The Company plans to carry out surface geochemical sampling programs prior to drill-
targeting for high-grade gold veins in this area.
