# LIVE Acquires the Mesa Top and Section 20 Uranium Vanadium and Molybdenum Mine Projects in the Colorado Plateau

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 5, 2024) - **Live Energy Minerals Corp.**(CSE: LIVE) (OTC Pink: GTREF) ("**LIVE** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that it has acquired through staking (pending approval from the Bureau of Land Management ("BML")) the Mesa Top Mine Property and the Section 20 Mine Property located on BLM land within McKinley County, New Mexico, USA (collectively the "**Properties** "). The Properties cover Jurassic age sediments within the Colorado Plateau and are prospective for Uranium, Vanadium and Molybdenum mineralization.

The claims were staked by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Lithium Valley Holdings Corp. and are pending approval from the BLM. The claims are also subject to a 3% NSR to an arms length party that assisted in identifying and directing the acquisition, which consist of 48 lode mineral claims totalling 960 acres. 

The Properties are underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Morrison formation which represent a Jurassic aged depositional environment within the Grants Mineral belt area of the Colorado Plateau. The Colorado Plateau is a geographical area covering large portions of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, it is a region known for its sedimentary hosted Uranium deposits consisting of over 1.2 billion pounds of mined and in situ U3O8. A subsequent assessment estimated 4.4 billion pounds of U3O8 total endowment in the Jurassic Westwater Canyon Member of the Morrison Formation, which is the main host in the Grants mineral belt (Hall et al., 2023).
