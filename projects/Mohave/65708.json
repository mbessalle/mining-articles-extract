    "description": "<p><strong id=\"dateline\">RENO, NV / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / </strong>Pershing Resources Company Inc. (&quot;<strong>Pershing Resources</strong>&quot; or the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot;) (OTC PINK:PSGR) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Mohave Project (the &quot;<strong>Project</strong>&quot;) located in Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.</p><p><strong>Project Highlights:</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p><strong>Extensive well-developed low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver vein complex and alteration system covering an area in excess of 2 sq miles or 6 sq kms.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Permitted in 2023 by previous optionee for up to 600 drill sites and up to 27 kilometers (~16.8 miles) of drill access roads within the property.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Post-1975 drilling includes 619 holes totaling 23,244 metres (76,260 feet). All were shallow holes averaging 37.5 metres (~122 feet) in depth with many bottoming in gold mineralization and open in several directions.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Over 40 abandoned mine workings (adits, shafts and declines) have been located / mapped on the property by previous operators, some of which have been recently visited and sampled by Company representatives.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Large areas of anomalous rock and soil geochemistry occur, along with numerous historical mine workings, none of which have seen any recent drill testing.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Included is a very extensive and well-organized database documenting much of the historical (artisanal) production up to the most recent exploration and production on the property.</strong></p></li></ul><p>&quot;The Mohave Project represents an excellent exploration opportunity that the Company simply could not pass up&quot; commented Patrick Burns, Pershing's newly appointed Director of Project Development (see Pershing news release June 10, 2024). Mr. Burns continued: &quot;The potential for near term production of gold and silver on this project is considered high and we look forward to systematically exploring the numerous historic gold and silver mineralized zones, many of which have never been recently evaluated. Finally, the large surficial expression of the mineralization and alteration, combined with relatively shallow drilling to date, suggests potential for additional mineralization at depth including not only increasing any Au and Ag resource, but for a mineralized porphyry intrusive target.&quot; Neil Novak Director of Exploration comments: &quot;The Mohave Project complements Pershing Resources' New Enterprise Project located approximately 50 miles to the southeast, as well as our Klondyke Gold Project situated 220 miles to the northwest near Tonopah, Nevada. All three projects align along Nevada's Walker Lane Gold trend as it coalesces into the Laramide Arc Copper Porphyry Trend in northwest Arizona near Kingman - an area we believe remains underexplored.&quot; The addition of the Mohave Project to our Arizona and Nevada property portfolio will result in significant cost sharing benefits and will reduce various risks of our exploration programs. Combined, these projects provide Pershing a strategic advantage within an increasingly important precious and base metals district.</p><p><strong>The Mohave Project</strong></p><p>Based upon a review of the extensively documented exploration data package in late March 2024, along with a due diligence site visit by Company representatives in early April, the Mohave Project is interpreted as an advanced stage low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver prospect. The Mohave Project land package currently consists of 160 contiguous mining claims covering approximately 3300 acres (1,336 hectares or 13 sq kms) in Mohave County, Arizona (including 13 millsite claims covering 65 acres). Access is via a well-developed network of roads and trails to numerous historical small mines and underground workings as well as several historical drill platforms by others over the past few decades. Permitting for construction of up to 600 new drill sites and approximately 17 miles of access roads was granted in 2022 for a property wide exploration program to a previous operator. This Permit is valid for the remainder of 2024 but requires payment of bonds once exploration commences on areas prioritized for immediate drilling. Permitting will need to be renewed in November of 2024 in whole or in part for subsequent exploration seasons into 2025 and beyond, at the discretion of the Company.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>The Mohave Project has an extensive and colorful history of exploration and small-scale mining dating back to 1865. Historical records suggest that gold was first discovered at the Dixie Queen in 1894. Exploration between 1974 to the late 1980's outlined several mineralized zones through relatively shallow surface drilling (<i>refer to Table 1</i>) along with additional exploration targets outlined by geochemical and geophysical surveys, many of which have never been drill tested. Extensive alteration mapping along with widespread gold mineralization has delineated at least three mineralized areas on the property: the Golden Door (discovered 1941), Klondyke (discovered 1898) and Dixie (discovered 1894) zones. Dixie has seen no drilling to date, despite the presence of highly anomalous rock and soil geochemistry and the presence of numerous historical workings.</p><p><i><strong>Table 1 - Selected historical

(\" Pershing Resources \" or the \" Company \") (OTC PINK:PSGR) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Mohave Project (the \" Project \") located in Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. Project Highlights: Extensive well-developed low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver vein complex and alteration system covering an area in excess of 2 sq miles or 6 sq kms. Permitted in 2023 by previous optionee for up to 600 drill sites and up to 27 kilometers (~16.8 miles) of drill access roads within the property. Post-1975 drilling includes 619 holes totaling 23,244 metres (76,260 feet). All were shallow holes averaging 37.5 metres (~122 feet) in depth with many bottoming in gold mineralization and open in several directions. Over 40 abandoned mine workings (adits, shafts and declines) have been located / mapped on the property by previous operators, some of which have been recently visited and sampled by Company representatives. Large areas of anomalous rock and soil geochemistry occur, along with numerous historical mine workings, none of which have seen any recent drill testing. Included is a very extensive and well-organized database documenting much of the historical (artisanal) production up to the most recent exploration and production on the property. \"The Mohave Project represents an excellent exploration opportunity that the Company simply could not pass up\" commented Patrick Burns, Pershing's newly appointed Director of Project Development (see Pershing news release June 10, 2024). Mr. Burns continued: \"The potential for near term production of gold and silver on this project is considered high and we look forward to systematically exploring the numerous historic gold and silver mineralized zones, many of which have never been recently evaluated. Finally, the large surficial expression of the mineralization and alteration, combined with relatively shallow drilling to date, suggests potential for additional mineralization at depth including not only increasing any Au and Ag resource, but for a mineralized porphyry intrusive target.\" Neil Novak Director of Exploration comments: \"The Mohave Project complements Pershing Resources' New Enterprise Project located approximately 50 miles to the southeast, as well as our Klondyke Gold Project situated 220 miles to the northwest near Tonopah, Nevada. All three projects align along Nevada's Walker Lane Gold trend as it coalesces into the Laramide Arc Copper Porphyry Trend in northwest Arizona near Kingman - an area we believe remains underexplored.\" The addition of the Mohave Project to our Arizona and Nevada property portfolio will result in significant cost sharing benefits and will reduce various risks of our exploration programs. Combined, these projects provide Pershing a strategic advantage within an increasingly important precious and base metals district. The Mohave Project Based upon a review of the extensively documented exploration data package in late March 2024, along with a due diligence site visit by Company representatives in early April, the Mohave Project is interpreted as an advanced stage low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver prospect. The Mohave Project land package currently consists of 160 contiguous mining claims covering approximately 3300 acres (1,336 hectares or 13 sq kms) in Mohave County, Arizona (including 13 millsite claims covering 65 acres). Access is via a well-developed network of roads and trails to numerous historical small mines and underground workings as well as several historical drill platforms by others over the past few decades. Permitting for construction of up to 600 new drill sites and approximately 17 miles of access roads was granted in 2022 for a property wide exploration program to a previous operator. This Permit is valid for the remainder of 2024 but requires payment of bonds once exploration commences on areas prioritized for immediate drilling. Permitting will need to be renewed in November of 2024 in whole or in part for subsequent exploration seasons into 2025 and beyond, at the discretion of the Company. History The Mohave Project has an extensive and colorful history of exploration and small-scale mining dating back to 1865. Historical records suggest that gold was first discovered at the Dixie Queen in 1894. Exploration between 1974 to the late 1980's outlined several mineralized zones through relatively shallow surface drilling ( refer to Table 1 ) along with additional exploration targets outlined by geochemical and geophysical surveys, many of which have never been drill tested. Extensive alteration mapping along with widespread gold mineralization has delineated at least three mineralized areas on the property: the Golden Door (discovered 1941), Klondyke (discovered 1898) and Dixie (discovered 1894) zones. Dixie has seen no drilling to date, despite the presence of highly anomalous rock and soil geochemistry and the presence of numerous historical workings.
