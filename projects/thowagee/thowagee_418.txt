ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
20/11/2024
Option to acquire strategic tenement – Gascoyne, WA
Highlights
• Taruga has executed an option agreement to acquire 100% of granted tenement
E08/3245 (“Thowagee”) in the northern Gascoyne province, WA.
• Thowagee is contiguous with Taruga’s current Gascoyne applications, and features two
historic polymetallic mining operations from outcropping hydrothermal veins (Thowagee
Mine and Thowagee Bore).
• Historic mining at Thowagee Mine produced 15.2 tonnes of lead and 5,878 grams of silver
from concentrate produced on site, with gold, copper and zinc also present in the mineral
system.
• Historical Rock chip results include1:
o TH12 – 0.39g/t Au, 88 g/t Ag, 15.5% Pb and 4.35% Cu
o TH16 – 0.6g/t Au, 134 g/t Ag, 30.3% Pb
o TH 8 – 0.55g/t Au, 19.5% Cu
o TH9 – 286g/t Ag, 59.3% Pb
o TH25 – 86g/t Ag, 22.1% Pb, 3.95% Zn
• The acquisition of Thowagee will increase the extent of the high-grade polymetallic
corridor under Taruga’s control to 20km’s, stretching from Donnely-Kooline in the North –
to Thowagee Bore in the South (Figure 1).
• No drilling for base or precious metals appears to have been completed at Thowagee,
with field exploration activities expected to commence shortly.
Summary
Taruga Minerals Limited (ASX: TAR, Taruga or the Company) is pleased to announce it has
entered into an option agreement to acquire 100% of Thowagee, complimenting the existing
Taruga application portfolio which now consists of 416.5km2 of contiguous acreage in the
Northern Gascoyne province of WA.
Thowagee includes two sites of historic mining (Thowagee Mine and Thowagee Bore) with high
grade polymetallic mineralisation occurring in outcropping veins and gossans. Taruga has also
applied for a new tenement (E/08 3752) that adjoins the Thowagee project and E08/3734
Uaroo East (Figure 1).
Director David Chapman said: “The acquisition of this granted permit now gives Taruga a
commanding land package in the Northern Gascoyne, with the high-grade polymetallic
mineralisation corridor now spanning 20km through our permits – with no base or precious
metals drilling. Numerous outcropping gossans and mineralised lenses are noted in historic
reports at Thowagee, some up to 2m wide and 50m in length. Taruga intends to conduct a
field visit as soon as possible, to ground truth historic workings and re sample the outcropping
mineralisation.”
* Comment on using historical data - All information in this release has been compiled from historical data reported in Geological Survey
of Western Australia’s MINEDEX Database, or in public filing of mineral exploration reports (the WAMEX archive). Information is
considered as historical by nature, and while all care has been taken to review previous reports, ground testing and confirmation work is
yet to be completed.

Overview
Taruga is pleased to have executed an Option Agreement with Western Silver Pty Ltd,
providing the right to acquire 100% of E 08/3245 (Thowagee) by paying $15,000 for an exclusive
6-month option. Within this 6-month period, Taruga intends to conduct exploration activities to
understand the mineralisation and potential, with the right to exercise the option and acquire
100% of Thowagee by issuing Taruga shares to the value of $85,000 (based on the 14-day VWAP
prior to Settlement).
Thowagee compliments Taruga’s three adjacent exploration licence applications whilst
providing a granted licence with significant historical workings in which to launch exploration
investigations (Figure 1). Historical exploration had a focus on base and precious metals (but
no drilling) and uranium.
The Thowagee and E/08 3752 permit areas have favourable geology, with the important
presence of the Leake Springs Metamorphics (previously called the Morrisey Metamorphics).
The association of mineralisation with shearing and faulting is notable with several historical
workings sitting near the significant structures of the Goordeman and Uaroo Faults (which run
NW-SE through the permits) (Figure 2).

Thowagee - Historical Workings
The Thowagee Pb-Ag-(Zn-Cu) mine has been described as two lines of narrow lenticular quartz
veins occurring in mica chlorite schist of the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite, within a broader
area of the Moorarie Supersuite granitoid rocks. At Thowagee mine, one shear/vein trends
north-northeast and the other north-northwest, having been worked in various pits and shafts.
A total of 15.2 t of lead and 5,878.4 g of silver were reported to have been extracted from
these veins in 1956. Sampling of the Thowagee mineralisation (1998, Table 1) shows a
polymetallic assemblage including significant elevations in economic precious and base
metals including lead, zinc, gold, silver and copper.
The location of the Thowagee workings (MINEDEX Site Code S0023816) is incorrect on the
MINEDEX site records. The actual location is centred around 349,455 East / 7,464,195 North
(GDA94 zone 50) and is based off coordinates reported in Squadron Resources Annual Report
2017: WAMEX Report A116226 and confirmed via inspection of aerial imagery that clearly
shows the described trenches/costeans and mine shafts.
Further south the Thowagee Bore locality (MINEDEX Site Code S0024122) is reported to be
galena dominant and include lead, silver, copper and zinc. The location and historical
production has not been verified.
Geology
The Thowagee and Uaroo project areas sit within the northern portion of the Gascoyne
province, a complex set of folded, faulted, metamorphosed and later intruded set of rocks.
The Thowagee project includes Leake Springs Metamorphics and Moorarie Supersuite granites
with dolerite dykes.
Figure 2: Local geology (GSWA 500K interpreted basement) and workings.
ASX:TAR tarugaminerals.com.au

Reported geology of the Thowagee mine supports the presence of Leake Springs
Metamorphics in the area. The sediment cover in this area may have limited the outcrop and
so requires further field investigation into the grade of metamorphism and rocks present. The
Leake Springs Metamorphics are locally intruded by foliated and gneissic granite of the
Moorarie Supersuite. Both units are unconformably overlain by the Paleoproterozoic to
Mesoproterozoic Uaroo Group (Edmund Group), which consists of sandstone, siltstone,
mudstone, banded iron formation, dolostone, and chert with minor conglomerate.
Structurally, the Uaroo Fault crosses the licence area running South-East to North-West whilst
the main folding is the North-NorthWest to South-SouthEast Thowagee Bore syncline.
Regionally, the acquisition of the Thowagee project extends the interpreted polymetallic
corridor of high-grade mineralised sites to 20km’s, stretching from Donnely-Kooline in the North
– to Thowagee Bore in the South. This corridor is part of a larger high-grade trend of polymetallic
mineralisation, which spans 50km from Mount Alexander to the North and finishing at the
Monte Carlo deposit to the South. Many of these workings sit within or near N-S trending dolerite
(mafic) dykes.
Historic records indicate the majority of the mines/workings have been classified as
hydrothermal vein/shear hosted deposits. The links to potential VMS mineralisation models will
also be considered along with other geological models that may apply to the workings within
the Taruga permit areas.

Next Steps
Taruga is planning initial field reconnaissance to review the Thowagee workings. An initial work
plan includes sampling the mineralisation and rock types present to verify reported grades and
map the structural trends in correlation with available geophysical data. Available data sets
include radiometrics, magnetics, mapped outcrop geology and interpreted bedrock maps.
The next steps beyond the initial Thowagee mine focus include implementing field programs
to rock chip gossans and their location and extent which is only been noted in historical
reporting without further details. Other follow up work will include using geophysical datasets
and in field mapping to trace out the host shear extents and mineralisation potential.
The field observations and verified historical data, including from neighbouring workings/mines,
are to be incorporated and interrogated as part of a broader review of the applicable
geological models for potential mineralisation events.
This announcement was approved by the Board of Taruga Minerals Limited.
