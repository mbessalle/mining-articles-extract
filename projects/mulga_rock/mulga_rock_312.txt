ASX:OMX
The granted tenements cover approximately 675km2, located in the Great Victoria Desert in WA, 290km by
road ENE of Kalgoorlie, with a further 557km2 still under application (see Appendix 1). These have strong
prospectivity for paleochannel hosted uranium/rare earth mineral deposits in addition to base and precious
metals.
Geology
Mulga Rock is a series of paleo-channel uranium deposits located within a regionally extensive paleo-
drainage system (Figure 1). Mineralogy is diverse with a number of critical minerals being present in addition
to uranium. The main uranium accumulation within each deposit occurs as a sub-horizontal body found
mainly in carbonaceous sediments of lignite and clays. Uranium and base metals were transported laterally
from source materials by acid rich meteoric flow, with metals deposited in favourable host rocks close to the
water table. At Mulga Rocks mineralisation typically commences at shallow depths of 30-60m.

Future Exploration
Post application of the Mulga Rock tenements, Orange Minerals has been compiling an extensive database
of historical data, including geochemical, geophysical and drilling information relevant to the OMX leases.

ASX:OMX
GIS datasets have been prepared for the Minigwal and Cundeelee 250k map sheets and the data will be
invaluable as a base for initial exploration program planning.
Future work includes combining and reinterpreting historical geophysical data sets to assist modelling of the
basement architecture and locating paleochannel positions in tandem with reviewing all available drill data
to identify suitable targets.
Forfeiture of Eastern Gold Fields Tenements
Eight prospecting licences in the Company’s Majestic Project, held by its subsidiary Majestic Gold Mines Pty
Ltd, have been forfeited by decision of the Warden for a failure to comply with minimum expenditure
requirements (P25/2660, P25/2661, P25/2663, P25/2664, P25/2665, P25/2666, P25/2667 & P25/2671).1 The
Company on legal advice lodged expenditure exemptions, which are ordinarily accepted with the issue of
fines, however they were refused and the Warden ordered the tenements be forfeited despite DEMIRS’
recommendation to impose fines. The Company is considering appeal options given the unprecedented
nature of the decision but does not consider the tenements material to the Project. The Company has
additional tenements due before the Warden in late January for similar proceedings (P25/2361 & P26/4470).
The Company is considering its options given the Wardens previous decision.
This ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Orange Minerals NL.
