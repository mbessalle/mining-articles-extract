ASX Announcement | 10th October 2024 
LITCHFIELD SECURES STRATEGIC COPPER-GOLD-BASE METALS PORTFOLIO IN 
NORTHERN TERRITORY  
Highlights 
•
The portfolio includes the Oonagalabi (Cu-Zn-Au) deposit, notable drill intercepts at
Oonagalabi include 36.6m @ 1.0% Cu and 1.7% Zn (PDH-L, from 1.5m depth), gold
was also sampled over three 1.5m intervals in this hole and averaged 1g/t.  Several
other drill holes also intersected mineralisation near the surface.
•
Historical drilling at Oonagalabi missed the majority of the induced polarisation
anomalies, which were identified in 2008, providing Litchfield Minerals with several
untested targets to explore. 
•
Drilling at the Oonagalabi sediment-hosted Cu-Zn-Au deposit (22 holes) has defined
a large mineralised system over 1.5km with mineralisation still open along strike to
the north and south along a northeast-trending fold hinge.  
•
Oonagalabi shares many geological similarities to the Jervois Base Metal deposit,
located 150km to the northeast (23.8Mt @ 2.02% Cu, 0.25 g/t Au, 25.3 g/t Ag)1.
•
The package also includes the Paradise Well (Cu-Au, REE) prospect 120km east of
Alice Springs and Silver Valley (Ag-Cu-Pb) prospect 300km northeast of Alice Springs.
•
Paradise Well has historic rock chip values up to 8.9% Cu and 2.2 g/t Au and hosts
several monazite rich areas (REE potential).
•
Silver Valley shows good potential for structurally controlled silver and base metals
mineralisation with rock chips up to 554 g/t Ag, 20% Pb and 11.9% Cu.
•
Litchfield has secured this prime portfolio of copper-gold and base metals assets in
the NT for $200,000.
1 Jervois Base Metal Project — KGL RESOURCES 
Litchfield Minerals Limited (“Litchfield” or the “Company”) (ASX:LMS), a company with a 
strategic emphasis on critical minerals, is pleased to announce the acquisition of a copper, 
gold and base metals portfolio. 
Managing Director and CEO, Matthew Pustahya, commented: 
“We’ve made a strategic move to quickly secure this asset package at what we believe is 
a pivotal moment in the market cycle.  The last time this portfolio changed hands it 
commanded a significantly higher price, despite minimal additional exploration work being 
conducted since then. 
The opportunity at the Oonagalabi Project and the broader portfolio presents a fantastic 
prospect for Litchfield Minerals to significantly expand our footprint in the Northern 
Territory's base and precious metals sector. The acquisition of this asset package not only 
aligns with our strategic emphasis on copper, base metals and gold but also demonstrates 
our ability to secure high-value prospects for extraordinary value.
The Oonagalabi Project, which already hosts extensive copper-zinc mineralisation over a 
1.5km strike length, offers untapped exploration potential, particularly with its similarities to 
the nearby Jervois Base Metal deposit. With known targets and untested induced-
polarisation anomalies identified, we see this as an opportunity to uncover significant 
mineralisation, with the potential to position us for substantial discoveries and growth in 
the near future.
This acquisition demonstrates our unwavering commitment to creating long-
term shareholder value.  We’ve also taken on board the feedback from our shareholders, 
many of whom have encouraged us to expand our focus to include prospects with silver 
and gold potential.  This acquisition does just that.  
While we remain highly confident in the prospects at Mount Doreen, with our ground 
EM surveys and another drilling campaign set for the remainder of this year, this new 
addition strengthens our pipeline of high-quality projects.  A successful exploration 
company thrives on having a robust project pipeline, and we weren’t going to let this 
opportunity slip through our hands. 
With our proven drive to explore and our technical capabilities, we are poised to 
deliver strong results within this portfolio.  The rising demand for base and precious 
metals, driven by global inflation, infrastructure expansion, and the clean energy 
transition, positions us perfectly to capitalise on the future.  We are confident this 
acquisition will be another key driver of growth and success for Litchfield Minerals.” 
Oonagalabi (EL32279) 
The Oonagalabi Project, along with Paradise Well to the south, are located in central Australia, 
120km east of Alice Springs, within a high potential zone for IOCG-type mineralisation as 
define within the Geoscience Australia Exploring For The Future Program (Figures 1 and 2).   
The Oonagalabi prospect offers an exciting opportunity to expand an already large 
mineralised system by testing blind shallow targets and drill-testing at depth.  Known 
mineralisation is stratabound within a complexly folded northeast-trending anticline.  Base 
metals mineralisation is predominantly hosted in marble and calc-silicate units, which are 
commonly malachite stained and can be mapped along strike for 3km.

within a regionally significant zone of high IOCG prospectivity.  Also shown are crustal-scale gravity lineaments. 
Figure 2.  Location of the Oonagalabi, Paradise Hil & Silver Valley tenements. 
Known for its consistent copper and zinc sulphide mineralisation, Oonagalabi has already 
produced impressive historical results across a 1.5km area in 22 historic drill holes, of which 
21 were drilled between 1970 and 1981 (Figures 3 and 4, Appendix 1). 
•
36.6m @ 1.0% Cu and 1.7% Zn (PDH-L, from 1.5m)
•
20m @ 1.71% Zn, 0.24% Cu (ONT79-2, from 200m)
•
24m @ 1.5% Zn and 0.64% Cu (RPO-2, from 138m to EOH)
•
12.2m @ 2.19% Zn (PDH-B, from 4.6m)
•
5m @ 1.26% Cu, 1.22% Zn (ONT79-1, from 70m)
Oonagalabi bears striking geological similarities to the Jervois Cu-Au-Ag deposit, which 
is 150km to the northeast (23.8Mt @ 2.02% Cu, 0.25 g/t Au, 25.3 g/t Ag2).  At Jervois, high 
grade mineralisation was remobilised and deposited into structural breccia zones during 
a later deformation event.  At Oonagalabi, potential for sulphide-rich, conductive zones 
was not

assessed by previous exploration efforts and remains a high priority target to Litchfield 
Minerals.  
Historic exploration has shown a strong correlation between surface soil geochemistry (Cu, 
Pb, Zn, Ag) and induced polarisation chargeability.  In 2008, Silex carried out a pole-dipole 
induced polarisation survey over a 2.5km by 2km area, revealing that historical drilling had 
not intersected these anomalies, leaving large zones of high chargeability undrilled.  The 
most prospective host rocks are concealed beneath the eastern limb of the northeast-
trending anticline. 
Figure 3.  Location of historic drill holes overlayed with the 2008 PDIP survey conducted with Silex.  Orange zones are also 
highlighted as potential mineralised zones further IP should be conducted over. 
Litchfield intends to complete further IP to define the full extent of the sediment-hosted 
mineralisation and then fly a VTEM survey & ground EM to define any potential high-grade 
breccia zones ahead of a drilling campaign. 
Figure 4.  Oonagalabi historic drilling showing mineralisation over a 1.5km strike.  Opportunities to expand mineralisation 
exist at depth (shallow historic drilling) and with testing blind IP chargeability anomalies on the eastern limb of the anticline. 
Paradise Well 
The Paradise Well Copper-Gold prospect, (EL32190), is situated approximately 10km south of 
the Oonagalabi exploration licence, covering an area of ~250km².    
Historical rock chip sampling has identified two high-potential prospects within the tenement: 
the Manny Prospect, which returned grades of up to 8.88% Cu, and the New Paradise 
Well Prospect, with copper and gold grades up to 6.24% Cu and 2.15 g/t Au.  Several 
potentially significant monazite occurrences have been identified with concentrations 
ranging from 5-40% monazite3.  Monazite is a rare earth element-bearing mineral and 
significantly elevates the REE exploration potential of the Paradise Well Project. 
3 https://geoscience.nt.gov.au/gemis/ntgsjspui/handle/1/65143 
These targets remain undrilled with no ground-based historical geophysics.  Litchfield will 
initially complete a detailed airborne magnetic survey to define potential IOCG targets. 
Silver Valley 
The Silver Valley Copper-Gold-Silver-Lead prospect (EL32241) is an exciting asset located 
approximately 300km north of the Oonagalabi Project (Figure 5), within the highly 
prospective Davenport Province.  This region, known for its Paleoproterozoic shallow marine 
sedimentary rocks and volcanic units, hosts four outcropping lead and silver-bearing quartz 
veins that have been historically mined through pits and shafts.  The tenement includes the 
highly promising Chablo Prospect, with strong potential for lead, silver, copper and gold 
discoveries.  Recent rock chip sampling has returned outstanding results, including assays 
of up to 554 g/t Ag, 20% Pb, 11.9% Cu, and 2 g/t Au.  Mineralised veins remain undrilled and 
the broader system has not been tested with ground geophysical techniques.  Potential 
remains to discover the larger causative mineralised system at depth within a dome 
structure below the outcropping Pb-Ag veins.

Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips,
or speciﬁc specialised industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down
hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These
examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material
to the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this

Oonagalabi IP Survey 
•
An Induced PolarisaƟon (IP) and resisƟvity survey was run
by Search ExploraƟon Services Pty. Ltd. in April 2008 and
used an oﬀset pole-dipole conﬁguraƟon.
•
The oﬀset pole-dipole conﬁguraƟon is run in spreads, each
of which consists of two parallel lines of IP receiver dipoles
on either side of a line of transmiter pole electrode
locaƟons (Figure 1). The Oonagalabi survey used 100
metre receiver dipoles and a separaƟon between
transmiter and receiver lines of 200 metres. Lines were

oriented west–east. Receiver lines consisted of 15 dipoles 
for a total length of 1500 metres and the transmiter lines 
were three kilometres in length. 
•
Four such spreads were used to cover the prospect and
produced detailed IP and resisƟvity data over an area of
1500 metres (west to east) by 2200 metres (south to
north). Further areas measuring 800 metres by 1800
metres were parƟally surveyed, west and east of the main
area due to the presence of transmiter electrodes in
these locaƟons.
•
AŌer ediƟng and averaging a total of 1702 independent
readings were collected. Most of these had primary signals
strengths greater than 10 millivolts and the majority have
clean IP data values. Approximately 20% of the data have
relaƟvely noisy but sƟll usable IP data values.
•
The data were processed using the “Res3DInv (Loke)”
three-dimensional inversion modelling soŌware. The ﬁnal
3D model was interpolated onto a regular mesh and plan
