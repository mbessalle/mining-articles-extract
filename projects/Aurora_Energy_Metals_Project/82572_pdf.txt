### ABOUT AURORA ENERGY METALS

Aurora Energy Metals is an ASX-listed company focused on the exploration and development of critical mineral assets.

Aurora maintains a strong interest in the AUP and significant exposure to its future upside, via an option agreement that, if exercised, will result in a substantial interest in a US-based entity with incentives to advance AUP and intending to publicly-list in the near future.
