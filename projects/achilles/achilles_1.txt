TONNAGE ANTIMONY PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
• Trigg signs purchase agreement to acquire the 100% of the Achilles project which contains the
globally significant high-grade and high-tonnage Wild Cattle Creek (WCC) Antimony Deposit.
• The WCC deposit is Australia highest grade undeveloped Antimony deposit and ranks among the
highest-grade antimony deposits globally1.
• Significant intersections recorded by historical owners of the project include (refer to Table 2 for
full results):
o 10.7m at 14.24% Sb
o 18.7m at 4.5% Sb from including 5.2m at 9.8% Sb
o 10.8m at 9.28% Sb
o 51.2m at 1.7% Sb including 5.5m at 4.8% Sb
o 22.5m at 3.9% Sb
o 12m at 4.3% Sb

• The WCC deposit is the second-largest antimony deposit1 in New South Wales, after Hillgrove,
with a resource of 610 kt at 2.56% Sb, containing 15,600 tonnes of antimony. This estimate is
based on a high cut-off grade of 1%, reported in accordance with JORC 2012 standards.
• Numerous ultra-high-grade drill intersections grading up to 14.45% Sb have been confirmed
beyond the existing JORC resource indicating significant resource upgrades.
• The deposit is enriched from surface and open down plunge hosted by an 6km long largely
untested structure.
• Historical metallurgy showed ultra-high antimony recoveries of over 95% are achievable from the
WCC deposit through a low-cost conventional milling and flotation technique.
• Trigg post completion will progress further exploration for resource expansion at the WCC deposit
while simultaneously advancing it’s 100% owned Taylors Arm antimony project which contains
Australia’s highest ever recorded antimony grade at 63% Sb.
• 100% non-cash transaction allows Trigg to preserve its healthy cash balance for value adding
exploration.
Trigg Minerals Limited (ASX: TMG) ("Trigg" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a
binding purchase agreement (Sale Agreement) with private company Anchor Resources Pty Limited
(Anchor Resources), to acquire the Achilles Antimony Project (Achilles) in northern New South Wales

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 30 September 2024
The Achilles Project hosts the globally significant high grade and high tonnage Wild Cattle Creek
antimony deposit, with a JORC 2012-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 610,000 tonnes
at 2.56% Sb, containing 15,600 tonnes of antimony (Indicated and Inferred categories). In addition to
antimony, the deposit is enriched with tungsten and gold.
Discovered in the 1890s, the project has historically produced antimony ore during several periods of
operation since then, with grades up to 46% Sb reported. Anchor Resources completed the most
recent work on the project from 2005 to 2016 when it completed 23 drill holes, two resource
estimation studies, orientation soil geochemistry, water and noise monitoring surveys, and sponsored
university research into the genesis of the Wild Cattle Creek deposit.
Trigg Minerals Executive Chair Timothy Morrison said, "Acquiring the Achilles Project, including the
Wild Cattle Creek antimony deposit, is a significant bolstering of our existing portfolio and provides
Trigg Minerals with an advanced project with a JORC resource and plenty of exploration upside in and
around the resource. Adding to our recent acquisitions of the Taylors Arms and Spartan antimony
projects, we expect Achilles to be our flagship, given its advanced state. This acquisition positions Trigg
as a globally significant player in the rush to secure Antinomy supply"

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 30 September 2024
second-largest antimony deposit after Hillgrove2 in New South Wales, with the potential for further
significant expansion through ongoing exploration.
Geology
The Wild Cattle Creek deposit is in the Coffs Harbour Block of the New England Orogen, within a Late
Carboniferous turbidite sequence dominated by siltstone (the Brooklana Beds). These sediments have
undergone multiple deformations, regional metamorphism (up to biotite grade), and granitoid
intrusions. The block is interpreted as an accretionary prism with subduction-related metamorphism
dated at 318 ± 8 Ma. Mineralisation at Wild Cattle Creek is like the nearby Hillgrove antimony-gold
deposit, located 80 km to the west-southwest and currently held by Larvotto Resources (ASX: LRV).
Wild Cattle Creek is one of approximately 235 antimony occurrences in the New England region of
New South Wales.
JORC 2012 Resource
The Wild Cattle Creek antimony mineral resource estimate, prepared by SRK Consulting in September
2013 in accordance with 2012 JORC, was based on 130 surface drill holes totalling 10,710 metres. The
deposit is exposed at the surface for over 300 metres and plunges approximately 25° westerly. It
extends down plunge for over 350 metres, where mineralisation remains open to the west (Figure 2).

The Company plans to restate and update the Wild Cattle Creek resource by extending resource
expansion efforts down-plunge and identify and test potential replicate shoots. These actions aim to
significantly increase the overall scale of the Achilles project and expedite the exploration of high-
priority regional targets.
Cautionary Statement
The resource estimates contained herein were prepared in accordance with the JORC (2012) Code by
SRK Consulting for Anchor Resources Limited (now Anchor Resources Pty Limited) in 2013. The
information has not materially changed since it was last reported. Nothing causes Trigg to question
the accuracy or reliability of the SRK estimates. Trigg accepts the quoted estimates and the Competent
Person’s (SRK Consulting) view that the resource classification appropriately reflects the deposit’s
knowledge level. It is possible that following evaluation and/or further exploration work the currently
reported estimates may materially change and hence need to be reported afresh under and in
accordance with the JORC (2012) Code. Trigg has not independently validated the former owner’s
estimates and is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting, or endorsing those estimates.
Full disclosures are required to comply with ASX's “Mining Report Rules for Mining Entities: See
Frequently Asked Questions” FAQ 37 (Appendix 1) and the attached JORC Table (Appendix 2).
Mineralisation
The Wild Cattle Creek mineralisation is hosted in an east-west trending brittle-ductile fault within the
Brooklana Beds. Stibnite mineralisation has been identified along a 6 km strike, with antimony
production also recorded at Fletcher’s mine on the same structure. The primary antimony minerals
are stibnite and minor berthierite, with accessory minerals like pyrite, arsenopyrite, wolframite, and
cinnabar. High-grade antimony occurs in breccia cemented by silica and sulphides, with stibnite found
in various forms, including fine disseminations throughout the cement and coarse-grained blades
intergrown with vein quartz and stringer veins. The breccia is flanked by metasediments containing
lower-grade stibnite and significant tungsten (wolframite and rare scheelite).
On the footwall and hanging wall, high-grade stibnite breccia is flanked by metasediments containing
stringer vein (or stockwork) style mineralisation. This mineralisation contains lower-grade stibnite but
significant tungsten in the form of wolframite and rare scheelite. Trigg will investigate the resource
potential of the lower-grade selvage to the high-grade mineralisation before any future resource
restatement.

* Holes lie outside the existing resource area
Metallurgy
Metallurgical test work in the 1990s showed that antimony recoveries of over 95% are achievable,
with a 60-65% Sb concentrate produced through conventional milling and flotation. Modern processes
can upgrade antimony sulphide concentrates to over 90% Sb, either as antimony trioxide or metal,
with test work indicating a product of >95% Sb as antimony trioxide. Gold, silver, and tungsten are
potential pay metals, while bismuth levels are expected to be low. Historical test work revealed native
gold, silver, and other minerals in flotation concentrates.
Anchor has reviewed all historical test work and conducted its own tests on drill core from 2009-2010
programs. Trigg will evaluate recent advancements in metallurgical processes for antimony recovery
from concentrates, including innovations such as molten salt electrolysis in antimony smelting.
Regional potential
The regional potential of the remaining exploration licence area has yet to be fully assessed. Given
untested historical workings and prospects along a 6 km mineralised structure, there is promising
potential for additional antimony discoveries. In 2009, Anchor’s reconnaissance sampling identified
stibnite mineralisation at several locations along this structure, showing similarities to the Wild Cattle
Creek deposit, including Jezebel and Fletcher’s Mine. Two exploration holes were drilled at the Jezebel
antimony prospect, 400 metres east of Wild Cattle Creek, where a scout drillhole in the 1960s
intersected 1.3m at 11.8% Sb (DDH36; Table 2). Whereas Fletcher’s mine lies west of Wild Cattle Creek.
Production from Fletcher’s mine was reportedly 1.5t of antimony in 1928.

ANTIMONY MARKET OVERVIEW
The global antimony market faces significant disruption and opportunity following China’s decision to
impose export controls on antimony ore, metal, oxides, and smelting technologies, effective 15
September 2024. As the world’s largest producer, supplying nearly 50% of global output, China's move
has tightened supply and driven prices to recent highs of $24,500 per metric tonne. This is expected
to increase market volatility and highlight antimony’s strategic importance, which has been classified
as a critical mineral by major economies such as Australia, the UK, EU, US, and Japan due to supply
concentration risks.
Antimony has diverse applications across key industries, including flame retardants, lead-acid
batteries, glass manufacturing, and ammunition alloys. Its strategic role also extends to military
technologies like missile guidance systems, night vision equipment, and nuclear weapons, making it
vital for national security.
The antimony market is positioned for growth, driven by rising demand in critical sectors. Its use in
photovoltaic solar cells improves solar panel efficiency, supporting the global shift toward renewable
energy. Stricter fire safety regulations are boosting consumption of antimony-based flame retardants,
while the growing electric vehicle market underscores its role in advanced battery technologies.
As global recognition of antimony’s value increases, the market is expected to expand, reinforcing its
status as a critical commodity for emerging technologies and essential industrial applications.

Creek deposit.
• 1992-1998 Allegiance Mining acquired the Wild
Cattle Creek deposit with the intention of mining
and processing 100,000 tonnes of ore per annum
averaging >3.5% antimony. The company planned
to use the ANTEC hydrometallurgical process
developed by an Australian company, Hydromet
Corporation, to produce antimony trioxide under
licence, rather than selling a conventional flotation
concentrate with potentially high mercury (and
arsenic) values in the concentrate. Work
undertaken included additional drilling, including
25 pre-collared NQ diamond core holes (1,207m),
plus 35 shallow Gardner Denver airtrac holes
(512m), surface surveying, geotechnical studies,
mine planning, bulk sampling, metallurgical
testwork, mill and mine tailings dam design work,
and preparation of an environmental impact
statement and final feasibility study. Development
was halted in 1996 when a commercial agreement
between Allegiance Mining and Mineral Estates,
the ANTEC process operators of the
hydrometallurgical process, collapsed. No further
work was undertaken on the property and the
ground was relinquished.
