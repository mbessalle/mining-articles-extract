Lady Grey Farm-in Agreement
Extension
Lanthanein Resources Limited (ASX: LNR) (“Lanthanein” or the “Company”) advises that
it has entered into a variation deed to the Lady Grey Project farm-in agreement first
announced on 6th December 2023.
The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, West Kidman Pty Ltd (ACN 672 896 865),
have agreed with Gondwana Resources Ltd (“Gondwana”) and the Option Vendors
(defined below) to extend the date by which it may earn a 50% legal and beneficial
interest in tenement E77/2143 by six months by paying Gondwana consideration of
$200,000 cash.
This amount will be included as exploration expenditure incurred by the Company
during the 19th month and the 30th months after the earn in start date within the Stage
1 Earn In Period.
The extension was required due to delays with approvals from the Department of
Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS) with the grant of Programmes
of Work for the Company’s planned drilling programmes. The extension will allow the
Company sufficient time to finalise the drilling and receive assays to assess the
prospectivity of the project and to decide whether the Company would proceed with
the next stage of the farm-in agreement.
In addition, there were significant delays with scheduling heritage surveys of the areas
proposed for drilling.
Key Terms of the Farm-in Agreement
As announced on 6th December 2023, the Company entered into a binding farm-in
agreement ("Agreement") to acquire the right to earn up to a 70% legal and beneficial
interest in EL77/2143 (and any other tenement that may be acquired/applied for by the
parties) (“Tenement”) from Gondwana. The key terms of the staged earn in are set out
below.
