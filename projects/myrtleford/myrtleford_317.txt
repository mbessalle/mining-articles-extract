HIGH GRADE MYRTLEFORD & BEAUFORT GOLD PROJECTS
AVM has secured the right to acquire an 80% interest in the Myrtleford
and Beaufort Gold Projects against a backdrop of record high gold
prices
The Projects have been acquired from Serra Energy Metals, who has
spent A$6 million on exploration, on advantageous and low downside
risk terms to AVM
The Projects are strategically located in the heart of Australia's Victorian
Goldfields, a region renowned for producing over 80Moz of gold
The tenements host hundreds of mineralised workings, including
over 70 past-producing high grade underground gold mines, many
with grades exceeding 31 g/t Au
Key areas (Twist Creek and Magpie) at Myrtleford show strong potential
for further exploration success, building on exceptional results from
the Happy Valley Prospect
Many of these mines are located on mineralised structures that
extend for kilometres and remain largely untested by modern Figure: Myrtleford and Beaufort projects are situated in the Victorian Goldfields region,
exploration host to one of the highest-grade gold deposits globally
Advance Metals Limited (ASX:AVM) | New Projects Presentation | January 2025 | 6

MYRTLEFORD PROJECT – PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Myrtleford Gold Project represents a district-scale opportunity in a Tier-1
jurisdiction, with its large land position, proven high grade mineralisation, and
limited modern exploration presenting significant potential for growth,
particularly given current record gold prices.
• The Myrtleford Gold Project encompasses a 418km² historic gold mining district in northeastern
Victoria, located 290 km from Melbourne
• Features 70+ past-producing high grade underground gold mines, where historically limited to shallow
depths leaving significant potential for deeper, high grade mineralisation
• Drilling has confirmed significant high grade mineralisation below historic workings, with exceptional
results including intersections of 11.5 m @ 160.4g/t Au (including 0.6 m @ 2340g/t Au) and 5.9 m @
66.2g/t Au, demonstrating substantial potential at depth
• The project's flagship Happy Valley Trend extends for 13km and hosts numerous historic mines that
operated in the late 1800s and early 1900s - modern exploration began in 2021 and confirmed the
continuation of high grade quartz veins below historic workings
• The Twist Creek area comprises a 7km trend in the northern portion of the project with a cluster of
high grade historic hard-rock mines

BEAUFORT PROJECT
The Beaufort Gold Project within the Victorian Goldfields, ~145km west of
Melbourne
Setting analogous to numerous other significant gold deposits in Victoria
(region produced an estimated 1.16Moz of alluvial gold)
Strategically located near other world-class goldfields like Bendigo (22Moz
gold) and Fosterville (8Moz gold).
The project spans a 20km trend extensively mined for alluvial gold, but
modern systematic exploration to identify Bendigo- or Fosterville-style
mineralisation has not been conducted
Beaufort Project exhibits geological characteristics similar to the
Sukhoi Log deposit in Russia, one of the world’s largest gold deposits
suggestive of significant hard rock gold deposits
Beaufort Project is underexplored and presents a significant opportunity to
uncover large-scale, high grade gold deposits

VALUE PROPOSITION FOR A VICTORIAN GOLDFIELDS DISCOVERY
In less than three years, Southern Cross Gold (ASX:SXG)
has taken its market cap from $12M to over $780M based
of a high grade gold discovery at Sunday Creek in the
Victorian Goldfield.
Similarities between AVM and SXG projects1 in Victoria:
• Regions of prolific historical alluvial and hard rock
gold mining
• Historic mining was shallow, with little modern
exploration at depth
• Narrow, high grade, orogenic mineralisation with
exceptional gold grades
• Multiple kilometre-scale trends within semi-
continuous corridors Figure: Southern Cross Gold (ASX:SXG) share price chart, 2022 to present (data from marketindex.com.au)
• Limited/no drilling outside of main areas of focus
