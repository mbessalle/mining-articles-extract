Advance Metals to Acquire High Grade Gold Project in Victoria and High Grade Silver
Project in Mexico
Advance has entered into a binding agreement with Serra Energy Metals Corp. (CSE: SEEM and OTCQB:
ESVNF) to acquire an 80% interest via a joint venture on the high grade Myrtleford and Beaufort Gold
Projects in the Victorian Goldfields, Australia.
Simultaneously, Advance has entered into a binding agreement with Sailfish Royalty Corp. (TSX-V: FISH,
OTCQX: SROYF) to acquire a 100% interest in the high grade Gavilanes Silver Project in Durango,
Mexico.
HIGHLIGHTS – High Grade Myrtleford and Beaufort Gold Projects
o Advance secures the right to acquire an 80% interest in the Myrtleford and Beaufort Gold Projects
against a backdrop of record high gold prices – from Serra Energy Metals on advantageous and
low downside risk terms to Advance shareholders.
o The tenements host hundreds of mineralised workings, including over 70 past-producing high
grade underground gold mines, many which remain largely unexplored with modern techniques.1
o At the Myrtleford Project, Serra has identified a 13 km-long trend of significant gold
mineralisation, known as the Happy Valley Trend. This area hosts numerous historic gold mines
that were only mined to shallow depths during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Many of these mines
are located on mineralised structures that extend for kilometres and remain largely untested by
modern exploration. Recent drilling has confirmed high grade quartz veins extending well below
the historic workings, highlighting substantial exploration potential.1
o At the Myrtleford Project, 45 km strike length has been observed which co-relates to a significant
number of historical gold workings and historical gold mines, evidencing district scale
mineralisation including:
o Twist Creek Trend 7km strike length;
o Magpie Trend 16km strike length; and
o Happy Valley Trend 13km strike length.1
o Serra Energy Metals has reported high grade drilling intercepts of gold across its prior drilling at
the Myrtleford Project, including highlights of:
o HVD003 11.5 m @ 160.4 g/t Au from 190 m, includes 0.6 m @ 2430 g/t Au
o HVD007 5.9 m @ 66.2 g/t Au from 149.8 m
o HVD006 2.3 m @ 44.8 g/t Au from 135.1 m
o HVD003 0.6 m @ 148.0 g/t Au from 165.2 m

Project Overview
Beaufort Project
The Beaufort Gold Project is situated in the southwest of Victoria, approximately 145 km west of
Melbourne, within the Victorian Goldfields. The region has produced an estimated 1.16 Moz of
alluvial gold, with the primary hard rock source yet to be identified. This presents a significant
opportunity to uncover large-scale, high grade gold deposits, especially given its strategic location
near other world-class goldfields like Bendigo and Fosterville.1
The project spans a 20 km trend that has been extensively mined for alluvial gold, with alluvial
workings closely associated with major north-south trending structures1. The structural setting
features cross-cutting late structures that provide well-defined exploration targets. Despite its
historical significance, modern systematic exploration to identify Bendigo- or Fosterville-style
mineralisation has not been conducted, leaving the project underexplored and full of untapped upside
potential.1
The Beaufort goldfield exhibits unique geological characteristics, including high ratios of alluvial to
primary gold. Gold mineralisation is associated with quartz veins, pyrite, and other base metals within
pyritic black shales and late tectonic quartz veins. These features suggest that Beaufort may host
significant hard rock gold deposits yet to be discovered.4
The Beaufort Gold Project represents a compelling exploration proposition, combining a historic
mining region with a lack of modern systematic exploration. Its favorable structural setting and
proximity to major infrastructure further enhance its potential. Unlocking the primary source of the
2region’s substantial alluvial gold production could position the project as a significant contributor to
the Victorian Goldfields' ongoing gold resurgence.

Myrtleford Project
The Myrtleford Gold Project is located in the northeastern Victorian Goldfields, approximately 290
km from Melbourne. Spanning 418 km², the project consolidates an entire historic gold mining
district, encompassing over 70 past-producing high grade underground gold mines. Historically,
mining operations were limited to shallow depths due to water table constraints, leaving significant
potential for deeper, high grade mineralisation to be explored.5
Myrtleford hosts extensive structural trends, including the 13 km-long Happy Valley Trend,
characterized by numerous historic gold mines along strike1. These mines produced gold at
exceptional grades but were only mined to shallow depths during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Modern drilling has confirmed that high grade quartz veins extend well below historic
workings, with results such as 11.5 m @ 160.4 g/t Au (including 0.6 m @ 2430 g/t Au) and 5.9 m
@ 66.2 g/t Au, indicating substantial untested depth potential.1
The project lies within the Lachlan Fold Belt, which hosts some of Australia’s most prolific gold
deposits. Myrtleford’s geology is marked by mineralised structures extending for kilometres, often
intersecting high grade quartz veins associated with historic workings. Additionally, the Twist
Creek area, a 7 km trend at the northern end of Myrtleford, includes multiple historic structures
mined at an average grade of 31 g/t Au, further highlighting the project’s high grade potential.1,5
The Myrtleford Gold Project offers a unique opportunity to explore and develop a district-scale high
grade gold system within a Tier-1 jurisdiction. With a large land position, proven high grade
mineralisation, and limited modern exploration, Myrtleford is well positioned to deliver a
6

substantial resource. Its alignment with current record gold prices further enhances its strategic
value as a cornerstone project within the Victorian Goldfields.
The Happy Valley Trend within the Myrtleford Project spans an extensive 13 km and is
characterized by numerous historic gold mines distributed along strike and across the licensed area.1
These mines were predominantly active in the late 1800s and early 1900s but were only worked to
shallow depths, typically ceasing at the water table due to limited technology and capital at the time.
Many of these historic workings are located on mineralised structures that extend for kilometres but
remain largely unexplored using modern techniques, presenting significant untapped potential.1
Inaugural drilling began in March 2021, focusing on areas beneath historic workings at Happy
Valley. Results from this drilling confirmed that high grade quartz veins extend well below the
depth of previous mining activities, validating the potential for deeper high grade mineralisation.
These findings highlight the possibility of substantial growth within the Happy Valley Trend,
making it a key target for further exploration.1
In addition to the main Happy Valley Trend, the northern section of the Myrtleford Project features
a 7 km trend of historic workings with multiple structures mined at exceptionally high grades,
averaging 31 g/t gold. This adds another promising zone within the project, underscoring its
potential to host significant high grade mineralisation over a district scale.1

Figure 4 - Map showing collar locations of recent drilling (see appendices for detailed information)
Drilling at the Myrtleford Project has confirmed multiple intersections of high grade gold
mineralisation, including several high grade results1.
Drilling highlights from the Happy Valley area include:
o HVD003 11.5 m @ 160.4 g/t Au from 190 m; including 0.6 m @ 2430 g/t Au, and
o HVD007 5.9 m @ 66.2 g/t Au from 149.8 m;

o HVD002 0.7 m @ 100.1 g/t Au from 94.9 m.
9

These results indicate significant coarse gold mineralisation at depth, extending well below historical
workings.
At the northern end of the Myrtleford Project, the Twist Creek 7 km trend features multiple
historically mined structures, averaging 31 g/t gold. The area remains a high priority target for further
exploration due to its underexplored mineralised structures and potential for additional high grade
discoveries.1
Drilling at the Scandinavian Prospect, within the Myrtleford Project, has returned impressive results,
such as:
o TWD006 1.6 m @ 17.0 g/t Au from 73 m incl. 0.6 @ 43 g/t Au
o TWD003 1.1 m @ 15.3 g/t Au from 67.9 m, 1.0 m @ 3.8 g/t Au from 111 m; and
o TWD004 0.8 m @ 14.2 g/t Au from 75 m.
These results collectively highlight Myrtleford's significant exploration upside, with both depth and
strike extensions across multiple trends presenting robust opportunities for growth potential.

About Victorian Gold
Australia is one of the world's top gold producers, consistently ranking as either the first or second
largest global producer. In 2023, the state was expected to produce over 300 metric tons of gold,
primarily sourced from well-established mining regions such as high grade sites like Fosterville in
Victoria. The gold sector continues to make a significant economic contribution, supported by
substantial exploration activities and expected to maintain growth with several expansion projects
underway.6,7
Fosterville Gold Mine
The Fosterville Gold Mine, located in Victoria, Australia, has emerged as one of the country's most
prolific gold producers in recent years. Operated by Agnico Eagle, Fosterville is renowned for its
exceptionally high gold grades, often exceeding 20 grams per tonne (g/t) in certain areas. In 2023,
the mine continued its strong performance, producing over 300,000 ounces of gold, thanks in part to
its successful underground mining operations and advanced processing technologies. Fosterville's
10

high grade ore has driven its status as a leading global producer, and its exploration efforts remain
focused on expanding resources in the highly prospective Swan Zone. With significant reserves and
ongoing investment in expansion, Fosterville is expected to remain a key contributor to Australia's
gold output for years to come.6,7

Geology
Beaufort Project
The Beaufort goldfield was termed “enigmatic” by Summons (1999) due to the very high ratio of
alluvial to primary gold.5 This unusual Au deposit has no surface expression and is hosted within
Upper Proterozoic rocks within the core of a large regional fold (Wood and Popov, 2006). The highest
gold grades (4 to 9 ppm) are associated with pyritic black shale in the hinge of the fold. Late tectonic
quartz veins host low-grade gold mineralisation that is interpreted to have sourced nearby alluvial
deposits. 4 Gold mineralisation is associated with quartz, pyrite, carbonate, minor base metals, and
platinum group metals (PGM).
Myrtleford Project
EL006724 is located mainly in the Eastern Subzone of the Tabberabbera Zone of the Lachlan Fold
Belt (VandenBerg et al. 2004). Turbiditic Ordovician Pinnak Sandstone of the Adaminaby Group
comprises the basement and was deformed by Benambran (Early Silurian) and Tabberabberan
(Middle Devonian) orogenic events. The Adaminaby Group is of a similar age and depositional
setting as the Castlemaine Group in the Bendigo Zone of central Victoria. The Castlemaine Group
hosts the Bendigo, Ballarat and Fosterville deposits near the transition from Early to Late Devonian
magmatism in central Victoria. The Tabberabbera Zone is thought to represent the northern extension
of Bendigo Zone rocks that were wrapped around a micro-continent known as VanDieland as it
became caught in the subduction zone to the east of the Australian continent during the Lachlan
Orogeny (Moresi et al., 2014). This is known as the oroclinal bend model.5

High Grade Gavilanes Silver Project Overview
Advance is also pleased to announce it has entered into a binding sale agreement with Sailfish Royalty
Corp. (TSX-V: FISH, OTCQX: SROYF) (‘Sailfish’) to acquire a 100% interest in the high grade
Gavilanes Silver Project in Durango, Mexico (‘Gavilanes Acquisition’).
Pursuant to the binding sale agreement, the Company will acquire the Gavilanes Project via the
acquisition of Sailfish’s wholly owned subsidiary Swordfish Silver Corp (‘Swordfish’) an entity
which is the legal and beneficial owner of 100% of the shares in Sailfish de Mexico S.A. de C.V (but
for 1 share registered in the name of Sailfish Royalty MGMT Corp and 2 shares registered in the
name of Sailfish Royalty Corp. which will be transferred prior to completion such that they are
registered in favour of AVM) which in turn holds a legal and beneficial interest in 100% of the mining
concessions that comprise the Gavilanes Project.
On completion, AVM will own 100% of the shares in both Swordfish and Sailfish de Mexico S.A.
de C.V such that it acquires 100% of the mining concessions that comprise the Gavilanes Project.
The acquisition of the Gavilanes Project represents a very low-cost opportunity to increase AVM’s
exposure to the silver sector, with an existing Foreign Estimate of silver endowment, as well as a
project which has previously had substantial exploration and drilling over the last several years
against a backdrop of record high silver prices.

Figure 6 – Gavilanes Project Location2
The Gavilanes Project, located in Durango, Mexico, within the prolific Sierra Madre Occidental
District, is an early-stage high grade silver-gold vein system with significant exploration potential.
The project spans a 135km2 land package with low to intermediate sulfidation epithermal polymetallic
veins, offering substantial room for growth and development. Current exploration has tested just
0.17km2 of the main zone, while an additional 0.28 km2 of known veins remain undrilled.2
Drilling to date has confirmed the presence of extensive untested veins and breccia zones, with veins
extending over 2 km but drill coverage limited to less than 900 m along strike. Additional zones,
including Central and Western Zones, show promise but require detailed mapping and sampling.
The deposit remains open at depth, with indications of increasing copper and gold grades. Recent
discoveries of additional veins and alteration zones underline the project’s untapped potential. With
supportive community relations, Gavilanes is positioned for expansion and advancement.2

Historic Drilling
In 2008, Hochschild Mining PLC (Hochschild) drilled 10 core holes for a total of 2,847.35m, testing
the Guadalupe structure with five holes, the Providencia structure with one hole and the La Cruz
structure with four holes, two of which are a pair from the same drill pad and set up, drilled because
the first hole was abandoned prior to reaching the target depth. No certificates or geology logs are
available for holes completed by Hochschild. Due to this lack of data, these drillholes are not used in
estimation of the Foreign Estimate.2
Santacruz Silver conducted diamond drilling in 2012 and 2013 in an area of approximately 800 x
250m, testing principally the Guadalupe-Soledad, Descubridora and San Nicolas veins systems. A
total of 9,623.9 metres of HQ core was drilled in 47 holes.2

Santacruz Silver Drilling Results
Data obtained from drillholes completed by Santacruz Silver in 2012 and 2013 was used in the
creation of the Foreign Estimate presented. Anomalously silver mineralised (>20 gpt Ag) veins or
structures were intersected in all 47 drillholes.2 To provide an indication of the possible economic
significance of the drillhole intercepts considering an underground mining scenario, composite assays
were calculated requiring downhole intercept lengths of minimum 2m, with minimum composite
grade of 100 gpt Ag, using a 90 gpt Ag cutoff to define limits of the composite samples, and allowing
a maximum of 1m continuous internal waste below cutoff within the composite. These composites
are presented as Table C and indicate potential for mineralised zones with grades and widths
consistent with narrow vein underground mining scenarios.2

Geology
The Gavilanes Silver Project lies within the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) province, a regionally
extensive Tertiary volcanic field which extends southeast from the United States-Mexico border to
central Mexico2. The total thickness of the volcanic sequence is approximately 2km, and it rests upon
Mesozoic clastic and calcareous sedimentary rock. The volcanic field is comprised of two distinct
volcanic sequences, an older andesitic and dacitic series, and a younger, pyroclastic dominated
rhyolitic series. The Lower Series is approximately 1km thick and is dominated by Paleocene and
Eocene intrusive and volcanic rocks, the latter comprising dominantly andesitic lavas and pyroclastic
deposits, with interbedded volcaniclastic strata. Silicic volcanic units are present but are a minor
component2. The volcanic strata of the Lower Series are cut by calc-alkaline intrusives. The Upper
Series unconformably overlies the Lower Series with erosional disconformity and comprises a 1km
thick sequence dominated by Oligocene and early-Miocene dacitic and rhyolitic pyroclastic strata

and volcaniclastic strata. Most significant metal occurrences in the SMO are hosted by rocks of the
Lower Series or the underlying Mesozoic strata. 2
The Gavilanes Silver Project area is underlain by the Lower Series volcanic sequence comprised of
Paleocene andesitic and dacitic volcanic rocks interbedded with epiclastic rocks of similar
composition, capped by Upper Series Oligocene ignimbrites. Andesitic and rhyolitic dikes have
intruded the volcanic strata.2
Eight mineralised structures have been identified in surface outcrop, and three, the Guadalupe-
Soledad, Descubridora, and San Nicolas zones, have been drill tested by prior project owner
Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd. 2 The La Cruz structure was tested by three shallow drillholes completed
by Hochschild. The other four known mineralised structures or veins are untested by drilling. The
mineralised structures are typically along the margins of flow banded rhyolite dikes that intrude the
country rock andesites. True widths range from less than 1m to greater than 10m. The mineralised
zones are not simple fissure filling veins, they comprise zones of structural and hydrothermal
brecciation, with sulfidized matrix, which are crosscut by discontinuous banded quartz-carbonate-
sulfide veinlets.2

as early-stage exploration on both the Gavilanes Project and the Myrtleford and Beaufort Gold
Projects. AVM will seek to raise further capital as the Board of Directors deems appropriate on the
most favorable terms to AVM shareholders feasible.
AVM Upcoming Catalysts
E79 Gold Projects –
AVM has already commenced working on securing a low impact assessment exploration permit in
order to conduct non ground disturbing exploration as well as conduct a confirmatory drilling
program, in order to confirm the high grade gold drilling results at the Myrtleford and Beaufort Gold
Projects.
Yoquivo High Grade Silver Project –
AVM is working to secure all required permitting and approvals in order to conduct a maiden first
pass confirmatory drilling program at its high grade Yoquivo Silver Project in Mexico which will
then be followed by step out drilling in order to expand the foreign estimate with the intention of
translating this into a maiden JORC resource.

Gavilanes High Grade Silver Project –
AVM is working with Sailfish to secure all required permitting and approvals in order to conduct a
maiden first pass confirmatory drilling program at its high grade Gavilanes Silver Project in Mexico
which will then be followed by step out drilling in order to expand the foreign estimate with the
intention of translating this into a maiden JORC resource.
Augustus Project –
The Board remains focused on moving towards its upcoming drilling program at its Augustus Copper
and Gold Project in the USA – subject to satisfaction of all requisite approvals.
Non-Executive Chair, Craig Stranger, commented “the acquisitions of the High Grade Myrtleford
and Beaufort Gold Projects and the Gavilanes High Grade Silver Project each in their own respective
right represents a compelling value proposition to AVM shareholders each on attractive terms. We
could have acquired either project on their own however both opportunities were presented to AVM
and together with the recent acquisition of the High Grade Yoquivo Silver Project in Mexico, we feel
clarify AVM’s high grade precious metals exploration strategy. We look forward to commencing
drilling at the Gavilanes Project and confirmatory drilling in Victoria as soon as is feasible”.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Advance Metals Limited.

Foreign Resource Estimate – ASX Listing Rule 5.12
Additional information pursuant to the requirements of ASX Listing Rule 5.12 regarding the use of
foreign estimates contained in this announcement in respect of the Gavilanes Project is as follows:
• The Foreign Estimate is sourced from a technical report on the Gavilanes Project titled ‘CSA
NI 43-101 Technical Report and Estimate of Mineral Resources, Gavilanes Silver Project,
San Dimas Municipality, Durango, Mexico Prepared for Sailfish Royalty Corp.’ dated 14
May 2021, completed by Matthew D. Gray, Ph.D and Derick Unger, C.P.G.
The document is available at www.sedarplus.ca.
• The Gavilanes Project Foreign Estimate has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian
National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101).
The Foreign Estimate contains categories of NI 43-101 ‘Measured’, ‘Indicated, and
‘Inferred’, that are consistent with the terminology used under the JORC Code (2012
Edition).
• The Foreign Estimate relates to the Gavilanes Project, which AVM has entered into the
binding sale agreement to acquire. The acquisition is considered material to AVM given the
size of the resource reported and the existing resources forms the base of AVM’s exploration
strategy at the Gavilanes Project.
• Details on the reliability of the Foreign Estimate are summarised in the JORC Table 1 below.
• The Foreign Estimate is based on 47 HQ drill holes and a total of 9,623m of drilling. The
estimate assumes a price of (in USD) $19.00oz Ag, $1,600oz Au, $3.50lb Cu and $1.00lb
Pb. The project considers underground mining methods, reflecting the orientation and
nature of the mineralised veins. The Foreign Estimate assumes potential selective mining
units that align with the narrow vein geometry observed in the deposit. Assumptions
regarding processing efficiency, recoveries, and beneficiation methods are made based on
industry standards for similar silver-dominant epithermal deposits.
• The Foreign Estimate is based on the latest drilling data available, which is set out at Table
C of this announcement.
• No more recent NI 43-101 estimates have been completed at the Gavilanes Project or
provided to Advance.
• It is anticipated that an on-site and database review will be required to verify the Foreign
Estimate as a mineral resource under the 2012 JORC Code. It is also possible that further
sampling and/or drilling will be required to complete the verification. This work will be
scheduled as soon as practical and will be funded out of existing cash reserves.
• Cautionary Statement:
o The Foreign Estimate of mineralisation included in this announcement is not
compliant with the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral
Resources and Ore Reserves (2012 JORC Code) and is a “Foreign Estimate”.
25

o A Competent Person (under ASX Listing Rules) has not yet done sufficient work
to classify the Foreign Estimate as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in
accordance with the 2012 JORC Code.
o It is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work the Foreign
Estimate will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or ore reserves in
accordance with the JORC Code 2012.
• A Competent Person’s statement is set out below.
Competent Person’s Statement
The information in this report concerning data and exploration results has been compiled by AVM
and reviewed by Mr. Joel Sidoruk, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Australian Institute
of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM), is a Member (QP) of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of
America (MMSA) and is currently contracted by Advance to provide technical advice and serve as
regional manager LATAM. Mr. Sidoruk possesses the relevant expertise in the style of
mineralisation, type of deposit under evaluation, and the associated activities, qualifying him as a
Competent Person under the guidelines of the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for the
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.’ Mr. Sidoruk has approved
the inclusion of this information in the report in the form and context in which it appears. The

classification is due to:
• Nature of the data used and of any assumptions made.
o The complex geology of the deposit.
• The effect, if any, of alternative interpretations on Mineral Resource
estimation. o Gaps in assay data caused by unsampled intervals in drill
cores.
• The use of geology in guiding and controlling Mineral Resource
estimation. o The absence of metallurgical testing data.
• The factors affecting continuity both of grade and geology. o Spatial imprecision in block model coding.
Geological Controls:
• While the geological model is considered robust in identifying the
general distribution of mineralised zones, the lack of detailed data and
continuity limits confidence in certain aspects of the interpretation.

was performed on rock chip samples, with a lower limit of
detection (LLD) of 40 ppb Au. Anomalous values up to 0.86 ppm
Au were detected in the dark slates.
Highlake Resources
Rock Samples: 29 rock chip samples. Collected from the Camp
Hill Range, with some samples taken from quartz ironstone
gossan. Data for these samples were not submitted to the
Victorian government or have been misplaced, so no detailed
analysis information is available.
E79 Resources
Soil Samples: 354 soil samples. Collected from the Camp Hill
Range using a Dutch-style hand auger, targeting C-horizon soils.
Samples were sieved to -2 mm, and 400 g of sieved soil was
submitted for extraction of the clay fraction (<2 µm). Before
shipping to the laboratory all samples were analyzed with an
Olympus Delta pXRF to determine As content. The pXRF results
were considered indicative only and all samples were
subsequently submitted for laboratory assay using an aqua regia
digestion followed by ICP-MS analysis for gold and multi-
element analysis. The laboratory assays for gold and arsenic are
reported in Table 3 with this report. For the elimination of doubt,
pXRF results were not relied upon and are not presented in any
map, image, table or text associated with this release.
Rock Samples: 38 composite rock chip samples. Collected as
composite samples weighing 2-3 kg from mullock piles, quartz
veins, and shallow pits. Samples were processed at Gecko
Assay Laboratory and ALS Laboratory. Sample preparation
involved crushing and pulverization to <75 µm. Fire assay was
used for gold analysis, and multi-element analysis was done
using ICP-OES or ICP-MS following acid digestion.
Additional Historical Sampling
Stream Sediment Samples: 6 samples. No details on collection
methodology. Analyzed for potential anomalies, but no
significant results were reported, so they were not further
discussed.
Measures to Ensure Sample Representivity
• Use of Duplicate Samples: A total of 14 field duplicate
samples were collected within 1 meter of the primary soil
sample. This ensures reproducibility in the sampling process
and provides a check on the precision of the sampling

method. Analysis of gold (Au) in field duplicates indicated a
coefficient of variation (CoV) of 20%, reflecting good
reproducibility even when values were close to the lower limit
of detection (LLD). For arsenic (As), a CoV of 12% was
observed, indicating high reproducibility in the sampling
method.
• Sample Preparation: Soil samples were sieved to -2 mm,
either at the field site when samples were dry or after drying
if collected wet. Approximately 400 g of the sieved soil was
submitted for analysis, ensuring that a consistent and
representative portion of the sample was used for laboratory
testing. Samples from the clay-sized fraction (<2 µm) were
analyzed to enhance gold concentration data. The ultra-fine
fraction method minimizes the nugget effect, allowing for
more consistent and reproducible gold analyses.
• Certified Reference Materials (CRM) and Quality Control: For
rock samples, two certified reference materials (CRMs) were
used. Geostats GAP-01, containing 3.237 ppm Au, was
submitted to Gekko Assay Laboratory, while ORES 262 was
submitted to ALS Laboratories for multi-element analysis,
including gold. Analyses at Gekko under-reported gold, while
ALS's aqua regia digestion method over-reported gold. The
relative biases for gold were +29% for ALS’s aqua regia
method and -6% compared to the certified fire assay method,
which was considered adequate for interpretation of relative
differences in the geochemical data.
Calibration of Measurement Tools and Systems
• XRF Calibration: A handheld Delta Professional XRF was
used to analyze samples through polypropylene sample
bags. The device was operated in "soil mode" with a 30-
second total count time, specifically to detect arsenic (As)
levels before shipping samples to the laboratory. Calibration
of the XRF device is implied as the use of CRMs (Certified
Reference Materials) ensures the accuracy and precision of
the XRF measurements. The reference materials provide a
benchmark for verifying the accuracy of the XRF readings.
• Laboratory Equipment and Procedures: Laboratories used for
sample analysis, such as Gekko Assay Laboratory and ALS
Laboratories, are ISO/IEC 17025 accredited. This
accreditation ensures that the analytical methods and
instrument calibrations conform to international standards.

Geology
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. Beaufort Project
• The Beaufort goldfield is classified as an orogenic gold
deposit with similarities to the Sukhoi Log deposit in Russia.
The mineralisation model is based on the enrichment of gold
in carbonaceous sedimentary rocks with subsequent
remobilization during regional metamorphism and
deformation.
• The three proposed genetic models for alluvial gold
mineralisation in the Beaufort goldfield are as follows:
1. Gold initially concentrated in carbonaceous black shales
and later remobilized during regional deformation and
metamorphism.
2. Typical quartz vein-hosted gold mineralisation with
associated base metals and silver.
3. Reworking of previously extensive White Hills Gravel
deposits, which carried alluvial gold from further inland
and contributed to deep lead deposits.
• The Beaufort region is situated in the eastern Stawell
structural zone of the western Lachlan Orogen, located
approximately 20 km west of the Avoca Fault. The area is
characterized by a sequence of Cambro-Ordovician
metasedimentary rocks of the Saint Arnaud Group, including
the Beaufort Formation and the Pyrenees Formation.
• The Beaufort Formation consists of metamorphosed turbidite
sedimentary rocks and dark slates containing disseminated
pyrite. It forms the core of a regional anticlinorium, with its
axis aligned near the Camp Hill Range.
• The Delamarian Orogeny established a dominant northwest-
trending structural fabric.
• The Benambran Orogeny introduced significant deformation,

• The region exhibits subdued magnetic intensity, with strong
magnetic plutons to the north and south.
• Bouguer gravity anomalies reveal that the exploration license
sits on a ridge between two gravity lows, with a northeast-
trending break passing through the town of Beaufort.
• Early Devonian granites are present to the north and west of
the exploration license, while Late Devonian granites lie to
the south and east.
• The exploration license is situated near the boundary
between Early and Late Devonian magmatism, reflecting the
deep margin of the Selwyn Block, a tectonic feature that
influences the location of major goldfields in the region
• Gold is found in laminated and brecciated quartz veins within
the Landsborough-Percydale mineralogical domain. Veins
trend northwest, cross-cut the regional cleavage, and were
re-activated during the Tabberabberan Orogeny.
• The pyritic slate horizon on the western limb of the
anticlinorium is a key exploration target. These slates contain
euhedral pyrite, which may have replaced earlier ferroan
carbonate. The pyrite hosts gold, and its undeformed
character suggests that it post-dates the main deformation
events.
• Brecciated, ferruginized, and sheared quartz veins are
common, particularly in pyritic black slates and brecciated
quartz veins. These features are commonly associated with
anomalous gold grades.
Myrtleford Project
• The project is situated at the boundary of Early and Late
Devonian magmatism, surrounded by Devonian-aged granite
bodies, and influenced by the Lachlan Orogeny. This tectonic
activity caused significant folding, faulting, and the
development of an "oroclinal bend" structure, similar to the
Bendigo Zone's geological environment.
• The area is characterized by multiple deformation events,
with F1 folds, slaty cleavage, upright anticlinoria, and
synclinoria. These features, combined with dextral
transpression from the Benambran and Tabberabberan
orogenies, played a key role in the emplacement and
deformation of mineralised zones.

between Early and Late Devonian magmatism, reflecting the
deep margin of the Selwyn Block, a tectonic feature that
influences the location of major goldfields in the region
• Gold is found in laminated and brecciated quartz veins within
the Landsborough-Percydale mineralogical domain. Veins
trend northwest, cross-cut the regional cleavage, and were
re-activated during the Tabberabberan Orogeny.
• The pyritic slate horizon on the western limb of the
anticlinorium is a key exploration target. These slates contain
euhedral pyrite, which may have replaced earlier ferroan
carbonate. The pyrite hosts gold, and its undeformed
character suggests that it post-dates the main deformation
events.
• Brecciated, ferruginized, and sheared quartz veins are
common, particularly in pyritic black slates and brecciated
quartz veins. These features are commonly associated with
anomalous gold grades.
Myrtleford Project
• The project is situated at the boundary of Early and Late
Devonian magmatism, surrounded by Devonian-aged granite
bodies, and influenced by the Lachlan Orogeny. This tectonic
activity caused significant folding, faulting, and the
development of an "oroclinal bend" structure, similar to the
Bendigo Zone's geological environment.
• The area is characterized by multiple deformation events,
with F1 folds, slaty cleavage, upright anticlinoria, and
synclinoria. These features, combined with dextral
transpression from the Benambran and Tabberabberan
orogenies, played a key role in the emplacement and
deformation of mineralised zones. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

• Gold is primarily hosted in shear- or fault-controlled quartz
veins (fissure, saddle, and spurry reefs) within the Pinnack
Sandstone, ranging from less than 1 m to 12 m in width.
These veins often contain up to 2% sulphides, including
pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, and sphalerite.
• Mineralisation is structurally controlled, with steeply dipping,
northwesterly striking quartz reefs associated with dextral
