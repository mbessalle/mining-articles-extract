Significant Marketing Progress through Traxys
Strategic Relationship
Alligator Energy Limited ASX: AGE (Alligator or the Company) is pleased to advise significant
progress over the first two years of the strategic relationship formed in May 2021 with Traxys North
America LLC (Traxys), the U.S. arm of the global commodities trading group Traxys. Under the
agreement announced on 10 May 2021, Traxys is providing uranium marketing services for future
uranium production long-term offtake contracting, will consider potential support in project
development financing and is assisting in uranium and energy minerals project acquisition
opportunities.
Highlights
• Traxys is a long-standing metals, minerals and alloys merchant, with a turnover exceeding US$
9 billion annually. Their uranium marketing and trading group covers the Americas, Europe,
Australia and Asia and transacts up to 15 million lbs U O annually, along with managing
3 8
contract supply books in conversion, UF6, futures and options.
• Alligator is deriving significant benefits from this relationship, including:
• Coordination of over 25 meetings in the last two years with nuclear utilities based both
in the US and Europe;
• Identification of several key anchor nuclear utilities willing to discuss establishment of
conditional offtake contracts with Alligator around the time of progression of a feasibility
study for the Samphire Project which is currently targeted for 2024;
• Joint attendance at several global nuclear conferences, including the recent World
Nuclear Fuel Market meeting where uranium and nuclear fuel component upwards price
pressure was a significant point of discussion;
• Continued involvement in the evaluation of external uranium resource opportunities to
develop a future supply pipeline; and
• Provision of regular uranium and nuclear market updates to both the Board and
Management.
• In March 20231 the Company released a Scoping Study for the Samphire Project which included
a target timeline for completing a bankable feasibility study, a mining lease approval and a final
investment decision. The ability under the Traxys Agreement to access pre-production finance
of up to US$15 million by way of a secured commercial prepayment for U 0 is expected to be
3 8
a significant positive in achieving these objectives. The support of Traxys in any mine start-up
operation provides the ability to backstop the initial commissioning production from Samphire to
meet contractual obligations should this be required.
• Recently Alligator Energy and Traxys attended the World Nuclear Fuel Market (WNFM) meeting
in Ljubljana, Slovenia, attended by many nuclear utilities, uranium producers and developers,
conversion, enrichment and nuclear fuel fabricators, and other industry players. The WNFM

in Ljubljana, Slovenia, attended by many nuclear utilities, uranium producers and developers,
conversion, enrichment and nuclear fuel fabricators, and other industry players. The WNFM

meeting presentations and discussions continued to highlight the increasing shortage of (in
particular) enriched uranium product (EUP) in the short and long term markets. This is due both
to transport difficulties and restrictions of Russian material to western markets, and due to
significant self-imposed restriction that utilities are placing on any contracted deliveries from
Russia. EUP requires the input of uranium concentrates, conversion and enrichment services,
and the consensus was that these components will continue to see substantial upwards pricing
pressure. Already the uranium spot price has lifted to US$57 / lb this month, and the long term
price lifted at the end of May to US$55 / lb, and is expected to continue to come under upwards
pricing pressure.
• Relationships with nuclear utilities take time to develop, and the planned Field Recovery Trial at
Samphire later this year and ongoing work into next year presents an opportunity for Traxys and
AGE to facilitate prospective customers to travel and view our Project’s technical operations at
the formative trial stage.
• The annual agency fee for 2023/24 of US$125,000 will be settled through the quarterly issue of
fully paid ordinary shares.
1. ASX Release 14 March 2023 – Samphire Scoping Study
Alligator’s CEO and Managing Director, Greg Hall, said “We view the relationship with Traxys as
a key differentiator for Alligator Energy, providing market penetration into the opaque long-term
uranium and nuclear fuels contracting business, while providing potential access to available
uranium supply to either support mine start up, or add to produced uranium volumes and increase
market share. The broader benefit of direct engagement with potential offtake customers and the
wider industry is already apparent from the interactions that have occurred over the last two years”.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the Alligator CEO and Managing Director.
