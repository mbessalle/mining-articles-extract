Tenements Granted and New Tenement Acquired at the Mt 
Mansbridge Heavy Rare Earths Project 
 
Engage with this announcement at the RareX investor hub. 
 
Highlights 
• 
High priority tenements now granted allowing 2025 exploration to begin 
• 
New tenement acquired with high grade yttrium boulders up to 2.7%  
o 
Yttrium is a proxy element for heavy rare earths 
• 
Heritage clearances have been scheduled for high priority areas 
• 
Mt Mansbridge is the priority exploration project for the 2025 season closely followed by Cummins Range 
near-mine anomaly exploration 
 
RareX Limited (ASX: REE – RareX, or the Company) is pleased to announce that the Department of Energy, Mines, 
Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS) has granted the tenements E80/5942 and E80/5973, which are part of 
the Mt Mansbridge Heavy Rare Earths project in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. 
 
The project is located 40km from the Northern Minerals (ASX: NTU) Browns Range HRE project, which is one of 
the most significant HRE districts in the world, with 7 xenotime deposits hosting 11.7Mt at 0.77% TREO (with DyTb 
contributing to 10% of the TREO)1. Iluka has recently pegged most of the ground between the Mt Mansbridge 
project and Browns Range project (see Figure 1) and are substantial shareholders of NTU, with a pathway to acquire 
19.9% of the company. 
 
The geology at Mt Mansbridge project is very similar to the Browns Range project, with 217km2 of exposed fertile 
Paleoproterozoic basement rocks with the outer rim of the tenement area containing an unconformity contact with 
the overlying Birrindudu group. This is the same unconformity contact that hosts the high-grade Browns Range 
unconformity heavy rare earth (HRE) deposits.  
 
The project is highly prospective for HRE xenotime mineralisation and the exploration upside is summarized below, 
with further details in RareX’s announcement dated 18 September 2024: 
 
• 
Historical pit samples at the Sigma prospect have shown up to 6.0% yttrium, a proxy element for heavy rare 
earths 
• 
Drilling has confirmed hydrothermal xenotime mineralization in basement rocks, which is open in all directions. 
Drill hole MMRC007 intersected 16m at 0.28% TREO from 77m, including a higher-grade portion of 4m at 0.48% 
TREO from 87m, with 1m at 1.06% TREO. Mineralisation is 58% HRE and 10% DyTb. The DyTb percentage is 
the same as the Browns Range deposits 
• 
There are several untested HRE soil anomalies in basement rocks and a 2km long untested soil anomaly along 
the Mt Mansbridge unconformity

Heritage agreements have been established with the Tjurabalan native title holders, ensuring responsible 
exploration and development practices. Heritage clearance on high priority exploration areas will begin once the 
Northern Australian wet season has finished. 
 
RareX Managing Director and CEO, James Durrant, commented "The exploration land package at our Mt Mansbridge 
Heavy Rare Earths project is now substantial and ready for exploration. We know there’s xenotime mineralization on 
the project, we know the region and the native title holders well, and we know the strategic nature of heavy rare earths 
to Australia. This project aligns with our focus on rare earths and niobium, supporting the global electrification 
megatrend. We look forward to progressing exploration activities and unlocking the full potential of this promising 
project." 
 
RareX is also pleased to announce a fourth tenement (E80/6118) has been pegged at the HRE Mt Mansbridge 
project. The tenement is 40 blocks in size and is located 8km to the south (Figure 1). The geology is very similar to 
the main project area and, in 1982, Sigma Resources located altered basement rocks and conglomerate samples 
from exploration pits. Samples were very strongly HRE mineralised with assays up to 2.7% Yttrium (Table 1). 
Yttrium in xenotime may be accompanied with high value dysprosium and terbium (DyTb). A sample at Browns 
Range project (50km to the north east) with 2.7% yttrium may hold up to 0.35% DyTb. Sigma Resources were 
exploring for uranium not HRE and a deep dive into the historical exploration results suggests these results have 
never been followed up. 
 
This tenement is expected to be granted by the end of the year.

Appendix 1: JORC Tables 
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as down 
hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF 
instruments, etc.). These examples should 
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning 
of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge 
for fire assay’). In other cases, more 
explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. 
submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
• 
The 5 RC drill holes were drilled in 2022 and 2023. Assays 
were for 1m intervals. There are no descriptions in the 
annual report for sampling techniques. It is assumed they 
were sampled to industry standards.   
• 
The 2011 Quantum soil sampling program (A103084) was 
completed on a 100m x 20m grid. Samples were taken from 
10-15cm depth below the humic horizon and sieved at -
200um using a nylon screen. 
• 
The 2011 Quantum rock chip samples comprised of a 
couple of pieces the size of a ﬁst. Each sample was 
submitted to SGS and crushed to 75um and digested using 
an acid mix.  
• 
The 2021 Red Mountain soil sampling program (A129270) 
was sampled on a 100m x 50m grid. Samples were 
collected 10-15cm beneath surface, 100g of -200um 
material was analysed by SGS.    
• 
The 2021 Red Mountain rock chip sampling program were 
3kg samples and were pulverised to 85% passing 75um.  
• 
The 1982 Sigma Resources Pit samples were taken from 
man dug pits. Material from the pit were selectively 
sampled using a scintillometer.  
No descriptions of reference measures taken to ensure 
sample representivity. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, 
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of 
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc.). 
• 
The 5 drill holes were drilled using an RC drill rig. No 
descriptions of the drill rig are in the historical report. 
 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature 
of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse 
material. 
• 
There are no descriptions of assessing chip sample 
recoveries or results.  
• 
No measures were described in the historical reports 
regarding maximising sample recovery 
• 
There are no details in the historical reports regarding the 
relationship between sample recovery/grade and sample 
bias

associated with hydrothermal silica vein-hosted and/or 
unconformity-related deposits. 
The most signiﬁcant occurrence in the region is the 
Wolverine deposit at Browns Range, with a resource of 
6.44 Mt at 0.96% TREO, 89% of which is HREO (30 June 
2022 MRE). Deeper drilling conducted in 2022 extended 
the mineralization to depths exceeding 500 m below the 
surface, with notable intercepts of up to 28.6 m at 4% 
TREO. 
Drillhole 
information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drillholes: 
o easting and northing of the drillhole 
collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in metres) of 
the drill hole collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o downhole length and interception depth 
o hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is 
justified on the basis that the information is 
not Material and this exclusion does not 
detract from the understanding of the report, 
the Competent Person should clearly explain 
why this is the case. 
• 
Drill hole details are in summarised in 18th September 
2024 ASX announcement – RareX review of Mt 
Mansbridge shows promising HRE potential. 
 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of 
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation should 
be stated and some typical examples of 
such aggregations should be shown in 
detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
• 
Drill intercepts have been calculated using a weighted 
average.  
• 
There are no metal equivalents

Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (e.g. ‘downhole 
length, true width not known’). 
• 
Orientation of the mineralised horizon intersected in the 
drilling has not been well deﬁned. Further drilling is 
required to establish whether the drill holes are true width 
or not. 
• 
The true width of the drill intercepts are unknown. 
 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Relevant diagrams are presented in the body of this 
report. 
• 
For further detail on exploration results see 18th 
September 2024 ASX announcement – RareX review of 
Mt Mansbridge shows promising HRE potential. 
 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
Reported exploration results are considered balanced. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but 
not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test 
results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating 
substances. 
• 
The project is at early exploration phase. As more 
information becomes available, RareX will report these 
results. 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further 
work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or 
depth extensions or large-scale step-out 
drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of 
possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling 
areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive. 
• 
Compile extensive data sets from historical reports 
• 
Further exploration activities will be announced in coming 
months.
