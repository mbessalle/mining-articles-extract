_______________________________________________________________________
Horseshoe Metals Limited (ASX: HOR) (the ‘Company’) is pleased to provide an update
regarding exploration activities at the Company’s Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Project
(HSL) in Western Australia.
The Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Project is the original Cu/Au VMS discovery in the
Bryah Basin (Figure 5). HSL is located approx. 60 km west of the DeGrussa Copper Mine
owned by Sandfire Resources (ASX: SFR) and approx. 35 km east of the Fortnum Gold
Mine operated by Westgold Resources (ASX: WGX). Past production from Horseshoe
Lights includes around 316,000 oz Au & 55 kt Cu metal in two phases of mining, and the
deposit contains a current in situ resource 128 kt Cu metal @ 1.0% (0.5% cut-off) and
36,000 oz Au (refer Table 6).
Ground Acquisition Expands Copper-Gold Exploration Footprint
Horseshoe is pleased to report the project area at HSL has recently been expanded with
the grant of E52/4372 (57 km2) to a total of 340 km2. Prospects added by the tenement
grant include Fiddlers (Cu), Fiddlers East and Fiddlers South (Au). Existing regional
copper prospects include Tritan and Tethys (Figure 1).

New Copper and Gold Exploration Targets Confirmed
Previous operators have completed exploration in the HSL project area that included detailed geological mapping,
rock chip sampling, Rotary Air Blast (RAB) assisted bedrock geochemical drilling and Reverse Circulation (RC)
drilling (Figures 2 to 4).
Historic Geological Mapping
Detailed geological mapping was completed in 1984 by Homestake Australia Limited (HAL) around the operating
Horseshoe Lights gold mine (Barrack Mines) and to the southeast along the interpreted extension of the
prospective Narracoota Volcanic sequence extending about 8km to the southeast (Figure 2). The target of the
mapping was gold mineralisation adjacent to jasperoids and/or hosted in quartz veins like the Fortnum gold
mineralisation that had been discovered by Homestake around the same time.
Historic Rock Chip Sampling
Several phases of rock chip sampling have been completed for Cu and Au since the early 80’s and have identified
several significant copper and gold prospects (Table 2 and Figures 2 to 4) including:
Copper Titan, Tethys and Fiddlers - results up to 1480 ppm Cu
Gold Fiddlers East and Fiddlers South – results up to 7.10 g/t Au
A large proportion of the mapped jasperoids and quartz veins remain unsampled and require detailed evaluation.
Historic RAB Geochemistry
RAB assisted bedrock geochemical sampling was completed by HAL at 160m by 20m spacing immediately east of
the mine and along the southeastern extension of the Narracoota Volcanic stratigraphy for about 8km (Figure 3).
The geochemistry identified several copper anomalies up to 2588ppm Cu that require follow up.
Significantly the RAB drilling immediately east of mine partly identified a copper anomaly at its eastern extremity
where it was restricted by a tenement boundary. This anomaly is open with a high of 649ppm Cu and is adjacent
to a fault structure interpreted to be parallel to the fault structure that hosts the Motters mineralisation on the
east side of the HSL open pit.
Historic Gold Only Intercepts and Targets
Previous RC drilling (some being waste dump sterilisation) has intersected significant gold mineralisation adjacent
to the existing open pit and in the southeastern Narracoota stratigraphic extension to the southeast (Figure 4 and
Table 1) including:
West of Open Pit A structure indicated by outcropping quartz veins extending from the south ramp of the
open pit to the northwest beneath the NW waste dump indicated by RC holes 3 to 8 in
Figure 4 with intercepts up to:
o 2m @ 8.00 g/t Au from 47m
o 2m @ 19.8 g/t Au from 110m
This quartz vein structure is interpreted to be hosted adjacent to a siltstone/mafic tuff contact in a similar
orientation to the Starlight mineralisation at Fortnum (refer figure 2 WGX release dated 13 November 2024)

East of Open Pit A structure indicated in non-systematic sterilisation drilling completed east of the mine
and subsequently obscured by mine infrastructure development indicated by RC holes 9
to 12 in Figure 4 with intercepts up to:
o 2m @ 22.6 g/t Au from 68m
o 4m @ 2.67 g/t Au from 52m
Fiddler East Significant intercepts in holes 13 to 17 in figure 4 that require infill and follow up
including:
o 4m @ 2.37 g/t Au from 30m
Proposed Work Programmes and Next Steps
The following activities are planned to further investigate the regional copper and gold targets:
• Site assessment of the auriferous quartz veins hosed in siltstone immediately west of the HSL copper
deposit will be completed in December.
• Rock chip sampling of outcropping quartz veins and jasperoids
• Auger assisted soil geochemical sampling (Cu and Au) in areas of historic RAB drilling and extending into
previously untested adjacent areas
• RC drill testing of targets
• Acquisition of open file magnetic data to aid delineation of additional targets in the project area
• Further detailed review of historic drill data to assist in building a copper and gold mineralisation model
Updates on the above activities will be provided as they progress in the coming weeks.

About Horseshoe Metals Limited
Horseshoe Metals Limited (ASX:HOR) is a copper and gold-focused Company with a package of tenements covering
approximately 500km2 in the highly prospective Peak Hill Mineral Field, located north of Meekatharra in Western Australian
and mineral interests in South Australia. The Company manages the Horseshoe Lights Project and the Kumarina Project in
Western Australia, and the Glenloth Gold Project in South Australia.

About the Horseshoe Lights Project
The Horseshoe Lights Project includes the historic open pit of the Horseshoe Lights copper-gold mine which operated up until
1994, producing over 300,000 ounces of gold and 54,000 tonnes of contained copper, including over 110,000 tonnes of Direct
Shipping Ore (DSO) which graded between 20-30% copper.
The Horseshoe Lights ore body is interpreted as a deformed Volcanogenic Hosted Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit that has
undergone supergene alteration to generate the gold-enriched and copper-depleted cap that was the target of initial mining.
The deposit is hosted by quartz-sericite and quartz-chlorite schists of the Lower Proterozoic Narracoota Formation.
Past mining was focused on the Main Zone, a series of lensoid ore zones, which passed with depth from a gold-rich oxide zone
through zones of high-grade chalcocite mineralisation into massive pyrite-chalcopyrite. To the west and east of the Main
Zone, copper mineralisation in the Northwest Stringer Zone and Motters Zone consists of veins and disseminations of
chalcopyrite and pyrite and their upper oxide copper extensions. Table 2 summarises the total Mineral Resources for the
Horseshoe Lights Project as at 30 June 2023.

About the Kumarina Project
The copper deposits at the Kumarina Project were discovered in 1913 and worked intermittently until 1973. The workings
extend over nearly 5km as a series of pits, shafts and shallow open cuts. At the main Kumarina Copper Mine, the workings
are entirely underground with drives from the main shaft extending for some 200m in the upper levels and for about 100m in
the lower levels at a depth of 49m below surface.
Incomplete records post-1960s make it difficult to estimate the total copper production from the workings. However,
indications are that the Kumarina Copper Mine was the second largest producer in the Bangemall Basin group of copper
mines. Recorded production to the late 1960s is 481t of copper ore at a high-grade of 37.0% Cu and 2,340t at a grade of
17.51% Cu. An initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Rinaldi deposit was completed by the Company in 2013 (see 30 June
2013 Quarterly Report announced on 31 July 2013). The total Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate
as at 30 June 2023 is shown in Table 3 below.

Historic
• All reverse circulation, diamond drilling and RAB drilling was logged to a level of detail considered sufficient at the time. However, the
nature of deposit that has been subject to strong weathering and alteration makes identification of stratigraphical units very difficult. The
lack of an early stratigraphical interpretation model and limited understanding of the deposit style has also caused inconsistency in the
logging by various geologists. As a consequence, only the overlying sediments and underlying shale and dolerite have been logged
according to their primary rock type. Barrack Mines Ltd and Sabminco NL used similar mine-specific geological codes to describe the
geological units. A metamorphic and alteration methodology was used to describe the volcanic stratigraphy but interpretation of the
various descriptions is very difficult.
• Original logging of historical diamond core described lithology, colour and mineralisation content as well as some geotechnical data
including core recovery, RQD data and alpha angle measurements. Approximately 10% of the original diamond holes in areas outside the
existing pit have been re-logged and photographed so far. Diamond core for Horseshoe Metals holes was logged for recovery and RQD.

to establish the degree of geological and grade
continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and
Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and
classifications applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been applied. |  |  | 2021/22
• HOR 2021/22 RC Drilling-Sectional E-W drilling, typically 20m spacing, otherwise various.

• RC and Auger sampling- drilling spacing and results employed in this program are considered sufficient to establish the degree of
geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.
• No sample compositing has been applied.
Historic
• The historical data spacing and distribution was not considered sufficient for the purpose of a modern resource estimation. Follow up
drilling has been completed to infill obvious gaps in order to provide sufficient geological and grade continuity. When the drilling was
complete, the mineralised domains display sufficient geological and grade continuity for the mineral resource procedures and
classifications applied to support the definition of Measured Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources under the 2012 JORC code. |  |
