_______________________________________________________________________ 
Horseshoe Metals Ltd (ASX:HOR) (Horseshoe or Company) is pleased to advise 
that its wholly owned subsidiary Murchison Copper Mines Pty Ltd (MCM) has 
entered into a Gold Surface Materials Rights Agreement (Agreement) with 
Melody Gold Pty Ltd (Melody Gold) for the right to process gold surface materials 
at the Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Mine (HSL).  
 
The Agreement covers designated gold surface materials adjacent to the historic 
open pit at HSL, including four subgrade stockpiles; the rehandle stockpile, gold 
leach vats, and perimeter; the gold ROM stockpile; and gold and flotation tailings 
(Gold Surface Materials) (refer Figure 1). 
 
Melody has advised it intends to treat up to 500,000 tonnes per annum in its 
proposed retreatment of the gold surface material utilising gravity recovery to 
produce a gold-copper-silver concentrate.

Commenting on the new development, Director Kate Stoney said: “Our team has hit the ground running 
in 2025; this agreement with Melody Gold signalling our clear intention to commercialise the significant 
and highly valuable copper and gold surface stockpiles at Horseshoe Lights as quickly as possible. 
 
The rebirth of the Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Project, driven in the initial stages by the 
commercialisation of the significant existing copper and gold surface stockpiles represents a fantastic 
opportunity for our shareholders and we look forward to providing regular updates as our team 
accelerates this strategy over the coming weeks and months.” 
 
About Melody Gold 
 
Melody Gold is a Perth-based mining company which specialises in the production, retreatment and 
export of high-quality gold and copper concentrate, with current operations focusing on the Eastern 
Goldfields. Its partners include Shandong Gold Co. Ltd. one of China’s largest gold producers; and Yantai 
Jinao Environmental Protection Technology Co. Ltd., a major mineral processing firm. 
 
Agreement Background 
 
MCM is the holder of M 52/743, the mining lease covering the Gold Surface Materials (Tenement). Only 
the designated Gold Surface Materials at the Tenement are covered by the Agreement. MCM retains 
the rights to all subsurface gold on the Tenement, as well as all other high-grade copper and mixed 
copper/gold surface materials forming part of the Company’s strategy for the sale of DSO material (refer 
ASX releases 31 October 2023 and 23 April 2024). 
 
Historic mining and processing were conducted in two phases in the period from 1984 to 1995: 
 
Phase 1 involved mining the gold rich part of the deposit from the surface to a depth of about 100 metres 
along with CIP processing. The cutoff used to feed the CIP plant was 1.5g/t and any mineralised material 
below this cutoff grade was stockpiled. 
 
Phase 2 involved deepening the pit and mining initially a high-grade DSO chalcocite/digenite 
mineralisation followed by mining the lower grade copper sulphide underneath to a depth of about 230 
metres along with sulphide flotation to produce a copper-gold concentrate. Any oxide copper mined 
during this phase was stockpiled on the surface (Figure 2).

Agreement Details 
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, MCM has granted Melody Gold the option for the right to the Gold 
Surface Materials (Option). In consideration for granting the Option, MCM has received payment of a 
partially refundable cash fee of $75,000 upon execution of the Agreement (Option Fee).  
 
The Option is granted for a period of 90 days (or such later period as mutually agreed), during which 
time the parties will have the opportunity to carry out necessary due diligence activities and seek any 
statutory approvals required. To exercise the Option, Melody Gold must make a non-refundable cash 
payment of $25,000. 
 
Upon exercise of the Option, MCM will grant a licence to Melody Gold for an initial period of three (3) 
years (Term), encompassing the right to process the Gold Surface Materials pursuant to section 118A of 
the Mining Act 1978 (WA) and the right to access additional specified areas of the Tenement (including 
water bores) relevant to its processing activities (Licence). The Term may be renewed by Melody Gold 
for two (2) further periods of three (3) years by giving MCM 60 days of written notice. 
 
The consideration payable under the Agreement to MCM for the granting of the Licence comprises: 
• 
a monthly fee of $25,000 (excluding GST), to be paid in advance on the first day of each month until 
the commencement of processing (Monthly Fee); 
• 
a processing fee of $50,000 (excluding GST), to be paid in advance on the first day of each month 
from the commencement of processing (Processing Fee) (at which point, Melody Gold will no longer 
be liable to make the Monthly Fee); 
• 
a tonnage-based payment (invoiced by MCM on a monthly basis) for the Gold Surface Materials 
processed on the Tenement, based on the 10% of the recovered Gold Equivalent value per tonne of 
Gold Surface Materials processed (Tonnage Based Payment). The Tonnage Based Payment will be 
partly set-off by the monthly Processing Fee;  
• 
Gold Equivalent means the gold equivalent of any saleable gold, copper or silver; 
• 
an amount equivalent to the statutory royalties (if any) payable by MCM to the State Government 
in respect of the Gold Surface Materials; and 
• 
a monthly cash payment of $1.00 per dry metric tonne processed, to be held in trust as a 
rehabilitation bond (Rehabilitation Bond Payment). 
Tonnage Based Payment 
 
(a) 
The Tonnage Based Payment will be calculated at 10% of the recovered Gold Equivalent value per 
tonne of Gold Surface Materials processed. 
(b) 
For the avoidance of doubt at a processing recovery of 70% and a gold price of $4,200 per ounce 
($135 per gram) the tonnage charges for the expected gold equivalent grade range of the Gold 
Surface Materials is as follows:

Note: The prices used will be based on the 10 day VWAP’s of the London Gold Fix and the LME 
copper price, and the exchange rate based on the Reserve Bank of Australia, prior to the final 
day of each calendar month (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing). 
(c) 
The Buyer must complete daily belt sampling of the processing plant feed conveyor in order to 
provide samples for gold analysis and moisture content determination. The Gold Equivalent 
analysis will determine the head grade of the Gold Surface Materials treated for that month. The 
moisture content value from this analysis will be used to determine the dry metric tonnage treated 
for the purpose of calculating the Tonnage Based Payments. 
(d) 
Before the end of each calendar month, the Buyer must engage a qualified expert (the 
appointment of which is subject to prior approval by the Seller, with such approval not to be 
unreasonably withheld) to undertake analysis and testing of all concentrates produced from 
processing of Gold Surface Materials as recorded under clause 3.3(a) and notified to the Seller 
under clause 3.3(b) during that month and determine (by written notice) the total contained grams 
of Gold Equivalent recovered from the processed Gold Surface Materials for that month. 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
(e) 
The recovered Gold Equivalent grade per tonne of Gold Surface Materials treated in any given 
month will be calculated using the following formula: 
R = Recovered Gold Equivalent grade per dry tonne of Gold Surface Materials treated 
D = Dry metric tonnage treated monthly determined from calibrated weightometers on the front 
     end loader feeding the plant and on the plant feed conveyor.  
G = Grams of contained Gold Equivalent contained in monthly concentrates determined by the 
      independent expert 
Formula: 
R = G/D 
 
Melody Gold will assume responsibility for all relevant insurances and rehabilitation obligations in 
relation to the Gold Surface Materials for the duration of the Term.  
 
Either party may terminate the Agreement without reason by providing 30 days written notice to the 
other party. In the event that there is a material breach of the Agreement by Melody Gold, MCM has 
the ability to immediately terminate or suspend the Agreement (such suspension continuing until the 
breach is remedied to MCM’s satisfaction).  
 
The Agreement otherwise contains terms and conditions which are considered standard for an 
agreement of this nature.

About the Horseshoe Lights Project 
 
The Horseshoe Lights Project includes the historic open pit of the Horseshoe Lights copper-gold mine which 
operated up until 1994, producing over 300,000 ounces of gold and 54,000 tonnes of contained copper, including 
over 110,000 tonnes of Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) which graded between 20-30% copper. 
 
The Horseshoe Lights ore body is interpreted as a deformed Volcanogenic Hosted Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit 
that has undergone supergene alteration to generate the gold-enriched and copper-depleted cap that was the 
target of initial mining.  The deposit is hosted by quartz-sericite and quartz-chlorite schists of the Lower Proterozoic 
Narracoota Formation. 
  
Past mining was focused on the Main Zone, a series of lensoid ore zones, which passed with depth from a gold-
rich oxide zone through zones of high-grade chalcocite mineralisation into massive pyrite-chalcopyrite.  To the 
west and east of the Main Zone, copper mineralisation in the Northwest Stringer Zone and Motters Zone consists 
of veins and disseminations of chalcopyrite and pyrite and their upper oxide copper extensions.  Table 1 
summarises the total Mineral Resources for the Horseshoe Lights Project.

About the Kumarina Project 
 
The copper deposits at the Kumarina Project were discovered in 1913 and worked intermittently until 1973.  The 
workings extend over nearly 5km as a series of pits, shafts and shallow open cuts.  At the main Kumarina Copper 
Mine, the workings are entirely underground with drives from the main shaft extending for some 200m in the 
upper levels and for about 100m in the lower levels at a depth of 49m below surface.  
 
Incomplete records post-1960s make it difficult to estimate the total copper production from the workings.  
However, indications are that the Kumarina Copper Mine was the second largest producer in the Bangemall Basin 
group of copper mines.  Recorded production to the late 1960s is 481t of copper ore at a high-grade of 37.0% Cu 
and 2,340t at a grade of 17.51% Cu.  An initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Rinaldi deposit was completed 
by the Company in 2013 (see 30 June 2013 Quarterly Report announced on 31 July 2013).  The total Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate as at 31 December 2024 is shown in Table 2 below.
