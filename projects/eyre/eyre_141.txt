Lincoln strengthens footprint on Eyre Peninsula with 
strategic tenement portfolio addition 
Highlights: 
• New Exploration Licence EL7020 expands Lincoln Minerals strategic eastern-Eyre 
Peninsula tenement package. 
• Prospective for base metals and other commodities, leveraging proximity to known 
deposits. 
• Tenement is underexplored with no prior drilling activity recorded. 
• Tenement prospective for base metals and other commodities. 
 
Lincoln Minerals Limited (LML or Company’) (ASX:LML) is pleased to announce it has been granted a mineral 
exploration licence for EL7020 at the Yallunda Flat area, ~15km west-northwest of Tumby Bay on South 
Australia’s Eyre Peninsula. The tenement is a strategic addition identified by our expert geological team and 
consolidates Lincoln’s ground holding in an area that is prospective for graphite, uranium, and base metals 
mineralisation.  
 
EL7020 is  underexplored, with no known drillholes within the area. However, the exploration lease lies within a 
region known for base metals with several historical copper mines to the east within EL5971 and numerous 
prospects which include copper, lead and zinc. The magnetic trend running through EL7020 has drilling along 
strike, for copper, lead zinc to the southwest and iron ore to the northeast. 
 
The tenement expands Lincoln’s presence in the Eyre Peninsula and is contiguous with adjoining tenements held 
by the Company that hold previously identified uranium, graphite and magnetite mineralisation.  
 
The Company will commence exploration in H2FY25 in conjunction with our other Eyre Peninsula exploration 
activities at Minbrie where Lincoln reported 29.5m @ 0.8% copper (Cu), 7.4% lead (Pb), 1.9% zinc (Zn), 9.0 g/t 
silver (Ag), including 12m @ 1.4% Cu, 12.4% Pb, 2.0% Zn & 13 g/t Ag [refer ASX announcement 4 December 
2024 ‘Discovery hole intercepts 12m @ 1.4% Cu, 12.4% Pb, 2.0% Zn & 13 g/t Ag at Lincoln’s Minbrie prospect”]
