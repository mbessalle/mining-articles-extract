Overview of the East Sampson Gold Project
East Sampson Dam (ESD) is a high-grade gold deposit with an interim Mineral Resource
Estimate (MRE) of 264,600 tonnes at 2.5g/t Au for 21,600 ounces Au at a 0.5g/t Au cut-off.
The MRE was prepared by Moho’s Mineral Resource Consultant CSA Global Pty Ltd in 2021.
Further modelling conducted by MOH has revealed substantial opportunities to enhance
the current Mineral Resource at East Sampson. The transaction has been structured to
ensure that Moho can capitalise on this upside potential while assuming no financial risk.
o Within the current resource boundaries, Moho has established an
exploration target that has the potential to increase MRE between 3 and 3.5
koz Au metal.
o Based on the existing resource distribution, there is potential for an
additional 4 koz of gold for every 20 meters of vertical below the current
resource base. (Fig1).
o The exploration target potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature
and there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource
and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a
Mineral Resource.
