CUFE ACQUIRES WEST ARUNTA TENURE WITH EXCITING GEOPHYSICAL
TARGETS
HIGHLIGHTS
• CuFe acquires E80/6052, located 13km north-east of existing tenure expanding its position in the
emerging West Arunta Niobium province to over 281 km².
• Geophysical review of 3D inversion modelling magnetic data over new tenure has identified two
prospective targets within E80/6052.
• Land Access agreement negotiations ongoing, with the Parna Ngururrpa Traditional Owners Group to
facilitate the commencement of on-ground works.
CuFe Ltd (ASX: CUF) (CuFe or the Company) is pleased to provide an update on the status of its West
Arunta tenure.
CuFe Executive Director, Mark Hancock, commented “We are pleased to acquire new ground in the exciting
West Arunta region. This acquisition gives us an additional target area that shows the right geophysical
characteristics to represent carbonatites / intrusive bodies. The tenement has synergies with our existing
landholding and there has been very little exploration undertaken in this area historically. We continue to
work with Parna Ngururrpa Traditional Owners Group in aim of securing a heritage and land access
agreement, which is required to commence on ground works given the tenure is located with an Aboriginal
Reserve area.”
Acquisition Details
CuFe has entered a binding agreement to acquire exploration application E80/6052 from an unrelated
entity, Territory Prospecting Pty Ltd. The terms of purchase comprise an upfront payment of $10,000 cash
and $25,000 in CuFe shares at an issue price of 1.6c per share (1,562,500 shares). Upon the later of the
grant of the tenure or the execution of heritage agreement a further payment is due of $50,000, to be made
in cash.
Tenure Update
The new tenement is located 13km North-East of CuFe’s West Arunta Project and 18km North-East of
Lycaon Resources Stansmore Nb-REE Project (Figure 1). The tenure is on land of the Parna Ngururrpa
Traditional Owners Group and exploration requires the consent of the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. The
tenement covers an area of 64km², this has increased CuFe’s tenement holding from 217km² to 281km²
(See Figure 1).
The tenement was previously held by CRA Ltd in the early nineties who were pursuing the geophysical
target as a potential kimberlite pipe however no exploration on ground was undertaken.

ASX Announcement – 18 July 2024
The Company further advises that wo of its three previous tenement applications E80/5925 and E80/5950
have been granted by the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation, and Safety (DEMIRS) on 30
May 2024 and 4 June 2024 respectively, with the third expected to proceed to grant within the next month.
The granted tenure covers an area of 58 km² and forms part of the Company’s 100% owned West Arunta
Project in the highly prospective West Arunta region (Figure 1).
On ground exploration activities are restricted until a signed agreement is in place with the Parna Ngurrurrpa
Traditional Owners Group and approval is given by the Minster of Aboriginal Affairs. CuFe continues to work
with the group on achieving this.
E80/6052 – Geophysical Modelling
Southern Geoscience Consultants were engaged by CuFe to undertake a geophysical review of the publicly
available airborne magnetic data for the newly acquired West Arunta tenement. The review included the re-
processing of airborne magnetic data, 3D unconstrained inversion modelling of the reprocessed magnetics
and the identification and development of targets that could represent carbonatite intrusive and Niobium
and REE mineralisation.
Analysis of the Total Magnetic Imagery (TMI) has identified two key anomalies labelled T1 and T2 in Figure
2.
More detail interrogation of the magnetic data using a half vertical derivative over the TMI imagery indicates
the anomalies could represent various forms of volcanic intrusive, including the potential for carbonatites
(see Figure 3).
3D inversion modelling of the magnetic vector (remanent and induced anomalies) are represented as
vertical small bodies which likely represent intrusive volcanics. The intrusion T1 located within the centre of
tenement E80/6052, is modelled with an approximate strike length of 2.05km and width of 0.65km, and
depth extent of 0.42km to 0.65km. T2 located 3km south-east of T1, is modelled with an approximate strike
length and width of 0.5km, and depth extent of 0.6km (see Figure 3).
It is worth noting that unconstrained inversion of the magnetic data was undertaken to derive these models
and the results are non-unique and many models may fit the observed data.
Further Work
Although the target areas identified could represents magnetic responses other than carbonatite intrusions
the review has provided valuable context to the very early exploration strategy and work streams planned
for when access to the ground is granted.
Early on ground exploration will include mapping of any outcrop, soil sampling and geochemistry in aim of
further characterising the anomalies defined in the geophysical review.
The current public data is derived from open file 200m line spaced data and initiating detailed ground
magnetic and gravity data can be advantageous in the exploration for carbonatite targets, as these targets
often exhibit a distinct geophysical signature characterised by coincident magnetic and gravity anomalies.
