BENZ EXERCISES OPTION OVER STRATEGIC GROUND 
ALONG STRIKE FROM THE GLENBURGH GOLD PROJECT  
HIGHLIGHTS  
• 
Benz has exercised the option to acquire highly prospective tenements adjacent to the 
Glenburgh Gold Project, increasing the total project tenure to ~898km2. Exercising the option 
has secured over ~20km of potential strike extension to the known mineralisation at the 
Glenburgh Gold Project. 
 
• 
Regional geological interpretation suggests similar lithologies that host the Glenburgh Gold 
Project continue into the new ground.  
 
• 
Opportunity to follow-up on quartz-magnetite breccia occurrences in the western part of tenure, 
previously identified by Hannans Ltd in 2021 as possible IOCG targets.1  
Benz Mining Corp. (TSXV: BZ, ASX: BNZ) (Benz or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has 
exercised the option agreement to acquire highly prospective tenements adjacent to the Glenburgh Gold 
Project in Western Australia, and a strategic tenement at the Mt Egerton Gold Project (Option Agreement).2  
Mark Lynch-Staunton, CEO commented: 
“We are thrilled to exercise this option over such a highly prospective land package along strike from the 
Glenburgh Gold Project. Our maiden drill program is already in full swing, with initial results anticipated in 
the coming weeks. With this strategic expansion, we’re not only extending our search for Glenburgh-style 
gold mineralisation by another 20km, but we’re also reinforcing our commitment to aggressively exploring 
and unlocking value in an underexplored gold district in Australia. This is an incredibly exciting time for Benz, 
and we can’t wait to see what our ongoing drilling and expanded exploration efforts uncover.”
