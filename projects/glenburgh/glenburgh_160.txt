Placement. The Company will pay Euroz Hartleys a fee equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the
Placement.
Acquisition Overview and Strategic Rationale
Benz has entered into the SPA to acquire a 100% interest in each of Gascoyne Resources (WA) Pty
Ltd (Gascoyne) (the owner of the Glenburgh Project) and Egerton Exploration Pty Ltd (Egerton) (the
owner of the Mt Egerton Project) from Spartan. The Projects are considered to be highly prospective
for gold and are complementary to Benz's strategy to generate value from underexplored gold
assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions. The Company's strategic rationale for the Acquisition:
1. The Projects are complementary to Benz's existing Eastmain high-grade gold asset: The
Eastmain Project remains an exciting growth and development opportunity for the Company,
with 1,005,000 ounces at 6.1g/t Au. The addition of Glenburgh and Mt Egerton is a strategic
decision to expand our growth opportunities in a market environment where gold prices are
reaching all-time highs.
2. Australian gold projects offer premium valuation multiples.
3. Ability to leverage and apply Benz's expertise: Benz's application of high-grade
metamorphic terrane knowledge to Glenburgh is a key differentiator, leveraging expertise to
unlock the true value and mineral endowment of the Glenburgh Project.
4. Bolstering Board and adding significant technical capability: Spartan's General Manager,
Nick Jolly, will join Benz as a Non-Executive Director on closing of the Acquisition. Nick has
been instrumental in Spartan's transformational discovery at Dalgaranga and will provide a
wealth of knowledge and expertise to Benz. Spartan to also advise Benz through a technical
advisory team and assist with ongoing exploration across Glenburgh and Mt Egerton.
5. Strategic Alignment with Spartan Resources: Spartan will hold an approximate 15% stake
in Benz post completion of the Acquisition and Placement (together, the Transaction), closely
aligning their interests with Benz, enhancing collaboration and mutual benefit.
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS
Glenburgh: Initial JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate: 16.3Mt at 1.0g/t Au (510,100 ounces
contained gold)
Glenburgh is a substantial 786km² land package situated 250km east of Carnarvon, Western
Australia. Strategically positioned near the craton margin suture zone between the Glenburgh
Terrane and the Yilgarn Craton, hosted within a Paleoproterozoic metamorphic gneiss belt.
Huge exploration upside over 50km of strike: 786km² over highly fertile craton margin,
metamorphic belt terrane. Limited gold exploration plays of this size in WA.
Metamorphic belts - next generation of discoveries: The potential of the gneissic metamorphic
belts surrounding the Yilgarn craton were only recognised in the last few decades - they remain
highly underexplored presenting a substantial opportunity.
Target package identified: Generally characterized by ~100-metre-thick horizon of gneissic rocks
with anomalous gold mineralisation encompassing significant high-grade gold zones.

High-Grade Exploration Focus
Benz's immediate exploration efforts will concentrate on the high-grade zones within the interpreted
"Target Package" (see Figures 2 and 3). Six high-priority targets with shoots exceeding 50 gram-
metres (Icon, Apollo, Shelby, Hurricane, Zone 102, Zone 126) have been identified within the
existing resource footprint, presenting a compelling opportunity for rapid high grade resource
expansion. Importantly, drilling on average has only tested the top 100m from surface, leaving
incredible upside potential at depth.
5km Soil Anomaly
In addition to these high-grade zones, the Glenburgh Project features an exciting 5km long, 100
ppb geochemical gold anomaly indicating the continuation of the main mineralising structure along
strike. Benz's geological modelling indicates that the prospective Target Package will likely extend
through this area, but at a shallow plunge to the northeast beneath surface cover rock. Current
shallow drilling efforts to test this anomaly would have been ineffective. The Target Package is
modelled to be present between 100-200m depth. This presents an exciting opportunity to
delineate an additional 5km of target package and associated high-grade zones.

Preliminary metallurgical results
In 2013, Asburton Hall Metallurgical Consulting managed test work performed at ALS. Three
recovery tests were conducted on 1kg sub samples of homogenised RC chips from hole VRC579
metres 210 to 240 (Zone 126).
The samples were subjected to a primary grind of 75µm, then put through a Knelson concentrator
for gravity recovery. The gravity tail was then subjected to standard cyanide bottle roll leach test
with residence of 24 hours. The results demonstrated an average extraction recovery of 96.8% after
24 hours. The results are summarised in Table 1 below. These results show very encouraging
metallurgical characteristics, with a high percentage of gravity recovery gold.

These intercepts are associated with quartz veining in shallow southwest-plunging shoots. The
Hibernian Mine, which has only been drill-tested to a depth of 70m, shows strong potential for
expansion through deeper drill testing and targeting new shoot positions.
In addition to depth extension potential at the Hiberinan Mine, there is a roughly 8km strike
extension to the Hibernian trend under shallow cover that remains underexplored.
Mt Egerton hosts an initial Mineral Resource Estimate of 0.28Mt at 3.1g/t Au for 27,000

options.

Next Steps
Benz and Spartan are actively working to fulfil the remaining conditions precedent to the Acquisition
(see Appendix 1 for details), paving the way for an exciting new chapter in this partnership.
In parallel with finalising the transaction, Benz is conducting a detailed geological analysis using
advanced lithogeochemistry. This approach will enable Benz to identify key target horizons and
generate high-conviction drill targets, setting the stage for a maiden drill program at the Glenburgh
Project in Q1, 2025.
We look forward to sharing more details on our forward exploration strategy in the coming weeks as
we continue to build momentum on these exciting developments.
This announcement has been approved for release by the Board.
