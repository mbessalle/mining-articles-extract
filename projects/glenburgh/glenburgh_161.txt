BENZ TO ACQUIRE WA GOLD PROJECTS FROM SPARTAN 
RESOURCES 
FIRM COMMITMENTS RECEIVED FOR A$4 MILLION PLACEMENT 
HIGHLIGHTS 
•
Agreement signed to acquire the Glenburgh Gold Project and the Mt Egerton Gold Project, located in
Western Australia, from Spartan Resources Limited (ASX: SPR).
•
Acquisition transforms Benz into a multi-jurisdictional gold focused company, aligned with the
Company’s strategy of growing and developing high-grade gold assets in top-tier mining regions.
•
Glenburgh has a granted mining lease and a Mineral Resource Estimate of 16.3Mt at 1g/t Au for
510,100 ounces within an 786km2 largely untested package.1
•
Transaction complements and strengthens Benz’s existing high-grade resource at Eastmain, which
currently stands at 5.1Mt at 6.1g/t Au for 1,005,000 ounces.2
•
Benz plans to apply proven advanced geoscientific techniques to unlock the high-grade gold potential
at Glenburgh and Mt Egerton; two high-growth-potential projects that have been largely
underexplored by modern exploration techniques.
•
While previous exploration efforts at Glenburgh focused on shallow lower-grade open pit resources,
Benz will focus on the vast underexplored high-grade potential. Recent results from high-grade Zone
126 deposit at Glenburgh illustrates wide high-grade zones open in all directions:
o
8m at 11.6g/t Au
o
28m at 5g/t Au
o
24m at 9.1g/t Au
o
14m at 8.9 g/t Au
•
Glenburgh shares very similar geological characteristics and setting to the world class Tropicana gold
discovery.
•
The Mt Egerton Project, also on granted mining leases, includes the high-grade Hibernian
Underground Mine. Previous high-grade intercepts for immediate follow up include:
o
5m at 96.7g/t Au
o
4m at 91.9g/t Au
o
4m at 75.3g/t Au
o
11m at 42.5g/t Au
•
To fund the Acquisition, Benz will use existing cash and funds raised from a placement to sophisticated, 
professional and institutional investors for which the Company has received firm commitments for
approximately A$4 million (before costs).
•
Spartan will become a strategic cornerstone shareholder, owning approximately 15% of Benz upon
completion of the transaction, and will provide ongoing geological support to Benz.
•

Acquisition Overview and Strategic Rationale  
 
Benz has entered into the SPA to acquire a 100% interest in each of Gascoyne Resources (WA) Pty Ltd 
(Gascoyne) (the owner of the Glenburgh Project) and Egerton Exploration Pty Ltd (Egerton) (the owner of 
the Mt Egerton Project) from Spartan. The Projects are considered to be highly prospective for gold and 
are complementary to Benz’s strategy to generate value from underexplored gold assets in Tier 1 
jurisdictions. The Company’s strategic rationale for the Acquisition:  
 
1. The Projects are complementary to Benz’s existing Eastmain high-grade gold asset: The 
Eastmain Project remains an exciting growth and development opportunity for the Company, with 
1,005,000 ounces at 6.1g/t Au. The addition of Glenburgh and Mt Egerton is a strategic decision 
to expand our growth opportunities in a market environment where gold prices are reaching all-
time highs.  
 
2. Australian gold projects offer premium valuation multiples. 
 
3. Ability to leverage and apply Benz’s expertise: Benz’s application of high-grade metamorphic 
terrane knowledge to Glenburgh is a key differentiator, leveraging expertise to unlock the true 
value and mineral endowment of the Glenburgh Project. 
 
4. Bolstering Board and adding significant technical capability: Spartan’s General Manager, Nick 
Jolly, will join Benz as a Non-Executive Director on closing of the Acquisition. Nick has been 
instrumental in Spartan’s transformational discovery at Dalgaranga and will provide a wealth of 
knowledge and expertise to Benz. Spartan to also advise Benz through a technical advisory team 
and assist with ongoing exploration across Glenburgh and Mt Egerton. 
 
5. Strategic Alignment with Spartan Resources: Spartan will hold an approximate 15% stake in Benz 
post completion of the Acquisition and Placement (together, the Transaction), closely aligning their 
interests with Benz, enhancing collaboration and mutual benefit.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS 
Glenburgh: Initial JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate: 16.3Mt at 1.0g/t Au (510,100 ounces 
contained gold) 
Glenburgh is a substantial 786km² land package situated 250km east of Carnarvon, Western Australia. 
Strategically positioned near the craton margin suture zone between the Glenburgh Terrane and the 
Yilgarn Craton, hosted within a Paleoproterozoic metamorphic gneiss belt. 
Huge exploration upside over 50km of strike: 786km² over highly fertile craton margin, metamorphic 
belt terrane. Limited gold exploration plays of this size in WA. 
Metamorphic belts - next generation of discoveries: The potential of the gneissic metamorphic belts 
surrounding the Yilgarn craton were only recognised in the last few decades – they remain highly 
underexplored presenting a substantial opportunity. 
Target package identified: Generally characterized by ~100-metre-thick horizon of gneissic rocks with 
anomalous gold mineralisation encompassing significant high-grade gold zones. 
Mining lease in place: A massive permitting hurdle already cleared. 
Tropicana look-a-like: Glenburgh shares very similar geological characteristics and setting to the world 
class Tropicana gold discovery. Primed for Australia's next Tropicana style discovery.

High-Grade Exploration Focus 
 
Benz’s immediate exploration efforts will concentrate on the high-grade zones within the interpreted 
"Target Package" (see Figures 2 and 3). Six high-priority targets with shoots exceeding 50 gram-metres 
(Icon, Apollo, Shelby, Hurricane, Zone 102, Zone 126) have been identified within the existing resource 
footprint, presenting a compelling opportunity for rapid high grade resource expansion. Importantly, 
drilling on average has only tested the top 100m from surface, leaving incredible upside potential at 
depth.   
 
5km Soil Anomaly 
 
In addition to these high-grade zones, the Glenburgh Project features an exciting 5km long, 100 ppb 
geochemical gold anomaly indicating the continuation of the main mineralising structure along strike. 
Benz’s geological modelling indicates that the prospective Target Package will likely extend through this 
area, but at a shallow plunge to the northeast beneath surface cover rock. Current shallow drilling efforts 
to test this anomaly would have been ineffective. The Target Package is modelled to be present between 
100-200m depth.  This presents an exciting opportunity to delineate an additional 5km of target package 
and associated high-grade zones.

Zone 126 – High-Grade Gold 
Drilling results from high-grade Zone 126 deposit at Glenburgh illustrates wide high-grade zones open in 
all directions: 
• 
8m at 11.6g/t Au  
• 
28m at 5g/t Au 
• 
24m at 9.1g/t Au 
• 
14m at 8.9 g/t Au 
 
Figure 4: Long section of Zone 126 at Glenburgh Project 
Rapid targeting with geophysics 
Strong association between high-grade lodes and increased sulphide mineralisation, enabling potential for 
downhole electromagnetic (EM) targeting. This relationship can enable downhole EM techniques to rapidly 
accelerate discoveries and extension of high-grade shoots.

Preliminary metallurgical results  
 
In 2013, Asburton Hall Metallurgical Consulting managed test work performed at ALS. Three recovery tests 
were conducted on 1kg sub samples of homogenised RC chips from hole VRC579 metres 210 to 240 (Zone 
126). 
 
The samples were subjected to a primary grind of 75µm, then put through a Knelson concentrator for 
gravity recovery. The gravity tail was then subjected to standard cyanide bottle roll leach test with residence 
of 24 hours. The results demonstrated an average extraction recovery of 96.8% after 24 hours. The results 
are summarised in Table 1 below. These results show very encouraging metallurgical characteristics, with 
a high percentage of gravity recovery gold.

Mt Egerton Gold Project 
 
Mt Egerton comprises two granted mining leases and five exploration licenses, covering a total area of 
179.59km² in the Lower Proterozoic Egerton inlier. Located in the Gascoyne province, approximately 
200km northwest of Meekatharra, the Project hosts the high-grade Hibernian Mine and the Gaffney’s Find 
prospect. 
 
Previous drilling at Mt Egerton has revealed exceptional high-grade intercepts, including: 
 
• 
5m at 96.7g/t Au  
• 
4m at 91.9g/t Au  
• 
4m at 75.3g/t Au 
• 
11m at 42.5g/t Au  
 
These intercepts are associated with quartz veining in shallow southwest-plunging shoots. The Hibernian 
Mine, which has only been drill-tested to a depth of 70m, shows strong potential for expansion through 
deeper drill testing and targeting new shoot positions. 
 
In addition to depth extension potential at the Hiberinan Mine, there is a roughly 8km strike extension to 
the Hibernian trend under shallow cover that remains underexplored.  
 
Mt Egerton hosts an initial Mineral Resource Estimate of 0.28Mt at 3.1g/t Au for 27,000 ounces3. The 
resource is within trucking distance to several operating mills for potential toll treating options.

Next Steps 
Benz and Spartan are actively working to fulfil the remaining conditions precedent to the Acquisition (see 
Appendix 1 for details), paving the way for an exciting new chapter in this partnership. 
 
In parallel with finalising the transaction, Benz is conducting a detailed geological analysis using advanced 
lithogeochemistry. This approach will enable Benz to identify key target horizons and generate high-
conviction drill targets, setting the stage for a maiden drill program at the Glenburgh Project in Q1, 2025.  
 
We look forward to sharing more details on our forward exploration strategy in the coming weeks as we 
continue to build momentum on these exciting developments. 
 
This announcement has been approved for release by the Board.

Appendix 3: Information in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.8.1 for the Glenburgh Mineral 
Resource Estimate 
Mineral Resource Estimation - data, methodology and parameters 
The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Glenburgh Project was estimated in 2020 by Cube Consulting Pty 
Ltd (Cube) (ASX:SPR 18 December 2020). Estimation data, methodology and estimation parameters are 
explained in this section of the report with more details available in the JORC Table in Appendix 5.  
Drilling, Sampling, and Sample Analysis Methods 
For the December 2020 MRE a total of 1,695 holes were used with 126,361m of drilling. A total of 74% of 
the drilling is RC and diamond drill core. Additional drilling since the previous MRE in 2014 includes 102 
RC holes for 8,372m. The majority of the drillholes are on a 25m grid either infilling or extending known 
prospects or deposits. Most holes are drilled towards the Southeast with a dip of -60°. 
RC drilling was made using a nominal 5½ inch diameter face sampling hammer. AC drilling used a 
conventional 3 ½ inch face sampling blade to refusal or a 4 ½ inch face sampling hammer to a nominal 
depth. Diamond holes were completed using NQ sized equipment for resource definition drilling (with RC 
pre-collars), HQ for geotechnical drilling and PQ for metallurgical drilling. RC drilling was used to obtain 
1m samples which were split by either cone or riffle splitter at the rig to produce a 3 – 5kg sample for 
shipment to the laboratory. A 4m composite sample of approximately 3 – 5kg was collected for all AC 
drilling. Drillcore was geologically logged and the halfcore sampled to geological contacts. Maximum 
sample lengths of 1.2m with a minimum sample length of 0.4m. 
All diamond and RC samples, and some AC samples were analysed for gold using a 25g charge Fire Assay 
with an AAS finish which is an industry standard for gold analysis. A 25g aqua regia digest with an MS finish 
has been used for 4m composites of the AC samples, where anomalous results were detected, single metre 
samples were collected for subsequent analysis. 
Database Compilation 
MS Access database containing drillhole information including Collar, Downhole Survey, Assay and 
Geology were used as the source information for the December 2020 MRE. 
Validation checks completed prior to MRE included the following: 
• 
Collar duplications, hole collar checks with natural surface topography 
• 
Downhole survey deviation checks in 3D software, survey quality ranking 
• 
Maximum hole depths check between sample/logging tables and the collar records 
• 
Checking for sample and logging overlaps; Reporting of missing assay intervals 
• 
A validated assay field was included into the Assay table (au use) to convert any intercepts that have 
negative values or blanks in the primary Au field (Au ppm). 
• 
QAQC data checks 
• 
Any data validation issues were recorded and forwarded to GCY database administrator for follow 
up and amendments made following updates 
Exploratory Data Analysis 
• 
Drill hole sample data was flagged using domain codes 
• 
Samples were composited over the full downhole interval 
• 
The most common sample length is 1.0m and covers the range of the Au grades 
• 
Top cuts were applied on a domain basis by application of grade capping for a composite data or 
using a grade distance threshold option

Interpretation and Wireframing 
•
The geological interpretations used for the December 2020 MRE work is mainly reliant on
predominantly closed spaced recent RC and DDH drilling. Drill spacing for the deposits is nominally
25m x 25/20m spaced RC and DDH holes stepping out to 50m x 25m or greater in the deposit
extensions.
•
Previous interpretations and modelling of sub-vertical to steeply dipping high grade metamorphic
gneiss have been confirmed by recent infill RC drilling and deep diamond drill core.
•
The mineralised domains acted as a hard boundary to control the December 2020 MRE.
•
Economic compositing using a grade cut-off of 0.3g/t Au was carried out in order to define relatively
contiguous zones of gold mineralisation. The cut-off used is based on low grade threshold of the raw
cumulative distribution plots of the gold data.
•
The economic compositing function in Leapfrog software was initially used followed by sectional
interpretations of the mineralised zone in Surpac 3D modelling software. Final validated 3D
wireframes were generated in Surpac.
•
A summary of the domains for each deposit is outlined as follows:
o
Northeast Zone - A total of 24 mineralised domains were interpreted for four separate deposits
– Zone 124, Zone 102, Hurricane and North East 3. Mineralisation consistently strikes E-W and
steep to sub-vertical dipping to the N (local grid). The interpretation extends over a strike length
of 2,420m and a vertical depth extent currently defined at 450m (325mRL to -125mRL). There is
an extensive down-dip projection for the dominant high grade domain in Zone 126 which also
displays a distinct westerly plunge of ~60°. The true thickness is highly variable between 5m to
50m.
o
Central Zone – A total of 34 mineralised domains were interpreted for five separate deposits –
Icon, Apollo, Tuxedo, Mustang-Cobra, and Shelby. Mineralisation consistently strikes E-W and
steep to sub-vertical dipping to the N (local grid). The interpretation extends over a strike length
of 3,350m and a vertical depth extent currently defined at 300m (300mRL to 0mRL). 7. The true
thickness is highly variable between 5m to 80m.
o
Southwest Zone – A total of 19 mineralised domains were interpreted for two separate deposits
– Torino, and Thunderbolt (formerly ‘SW Area’). Mineralisation consistently strikes E-W and steep 
to sub-vertical dipping to the N (local grid). The interpretation extends over a strike length of
3,050m and a vertical depth extent currently defined at 150m (285mRL to 135mRL). The true
thickness is highly variable between 3m to 40m.
Variography and Search Neighbourhood Analysis 
•
Variogram modelling conducted to provide parameters for OK estimation method – nugget, sill and
range for 3 directions. The variogram and search parameters for well-informed domains were used
to represent the poorly informed domains (smaller zones with very few composites).
•
Search neighborhood were chosen based on a special analysis, including the following steps:
o
A number of block size scenarios were considered based on the current drill hole spacing.
o
The parameters of the variogram models were used for the search ellipse orientation and the
search distance.
o
Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (KNA), using the Slope of Regression and Kriging Efficiency
was undertaken to decide on optimal minimum and maximum numbers of samples for kriging
estimation.
Block Model Definition and Grade Estimation 
•
Three separate block models were created for each of the main zones – East Model, Central Model
and West Model
•
The parent block dimensions used in the 3 block models were:
o
East Zone Model: 5m E by 2.5m N by 2.5m RL, with sub-cells of 2.5m by 1.25m by 1.25m.
o
Central Zone Model: 5m E by 2.5m N by 2.5m RL, with sub-cells of 2.5m by 1.25m by 1.25m.
o
West Zone Model: 12.5m E by 5m N by 5m RL, with sub-cells of 6.25m by 1.25m by 2.5m.
o
The parent block size and sub-blocking were deemed appropriate for the mineralisation.
o
The mineralised domain wireframes were used to code the block model and the volume.
 
19
Suite 2501-550 Burrard Street Vancouver BC V6C 2B5 | T: +61 (8) 6143 6702 | Email: info@benzmining.com 
o 
Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Local Uniform Conditioning (LUC) were the estimation methods used 
for the Glenburgh deposits. Inverse distance to the power of two (ID2) was included in the grade 
interpolation runs as a check estimate. 
o 
LUC was used where the interpretations in the East Zone and Central Zone included several 
broader mineralisation domains (+25m true thickness). This estimation method was used as it 
attempts to provide better local grade estimation for mining evaluation. 
o 
OK estimation was used for all other domains which have substantially less concentrated drilling. 
o 
Gold was estimated in 2 passes – 1st pass using optimum search distances for each domain (max 
150m) as determined through the KNA process, 2nd pass, set at longer distances in order to 
populate all blocks (2nd = max 300m, 3rd > 300m if required). 
o 
A waste domain boundary encompassing the mineralisation domains and within the limits of the 
drilling and host units was modelled for each deposit, and also included in the grade estimation 
runs. This allowed for any isolated zones and any mineralised haloes proximal to the hard 
boundary mineralised blocks to be estimated for assessment of dilution within pit optimisation 
limits. 
Block model validation 
Model validation procedures included: 
• 
Visual inspection of block model estimation in relation to raw drill data and composite grade 
distribution plots in 3D and in section and flitch plan views. 
• 
Volumetric comparison of the wireframe/solid volume to that of the block model volume for each 
domain. 
• 
A global statistical comparison of input (composite mean grades) and block mean grades for each 
mineralisation domain. 
• 
Compilation of grade and volume relationship plots (swath plots) for the Easting and RL directions 
which compares the composite data with the estimate. The mean block estimate at 25m slices was 
compared with the corresponding composite mean grade. 
• 
Where significant discrepancies occurred, these were investigated and minor adjustments or 
amendments to errors made to estimation parameters used in the grade interpolation process. 
Dry Bulk Density 
For each block model the bulk density assignment is based averaging the bulk density measurements 
obtained from core and from previous metallurgical test work, and bulk density test work taken from 
geotechnical test pits over the deposits. Density was assigned as follows: 
• 
Oxide (all material) = 2.50 t/m3 
• 
Transition (all material) = 2.55 t/m3 
• 
Fresh: 
o 
Mineralised Rock (Altered Gneissic Rock) = 2.82 t/m3 
o 
Waste Rock (Outside of Min-Waste Envelope) = 2.79 t/m3 
• 
Transition (all material, as used in 2012) = 2.65 t/m3 
• 
Fresh (all material, as used in 2012) = 2.78 t/m3 
Classification 
The Mineral Resource has been classified as Indicated and Inferred based on data spacing and using a 
combination of historical knowledge of geological and mineralisation continuity, as well as the drill spacing 
and geostatistical measures to provide confidence in the tonnage and grade estimates. RC and diamond 
drill since the 1993 makes up approximately 73% of drill hole records used to inform blocks for the estimate. 
The main criteria for classification includes the following: 
• 
Indicated Mineral Resources – defined within areas of close spaced diamond and RC drilling of 25m 
by 25m or less, and where the continuity and predictability of the lode positions was good. 
 
20
Suite 2501-550 Burrard Street Vancouver BC V6C 2B5 | T: +61 (8) 6143 6702 | Email: info@benzmining.com 
• 
Inferred Mineral Resources – assigned to areas of the deposit where drill hole spacing was greater 
than 25m by 25m and where small, isolated pods of mineralisation occur outside the main 
mineralised trends. 
Domains where block grades were not filled after the 3rd. interpolation pass or were assigned with a mean 
composite grade were assigned as un-classified. 
Mining Factors and Assumptions 
For all deposits optimisation pit shells were generated in Deswik Pseudoflow software based on: 
• 
Gold Price assumption of AUD$2,800/Oz 
• 
Gascoyne Dalgaranga cost experience for Mining, Processing and Administration 
• 
Wall angles of 50 degrees in fresh material 
• 
Gascoyne Dalgaranga experience of 95% for LUC modelling gold metal recovery 
• 
Glenburgh metallurgical test work defined process recoveries of 92.1 to 96.2% 
For Underground areas, mining stope shapes were generated based on 3m minimum mining width in all 
potential mining areas and a filtering cut-off grade then being applied to all shapes. 
Metallurgical Factors and Assumptions 
Metallurgical factors and assumptions are based on Glenburgh metallurgical test work Metallurgical test 
work was carried out on samples from Zone 102, Zone 126, Icon and Apollo deposits in 2013. The test work 
showed significant gravity recoverable gold was evident in the tested ore samples. Total gold recoveries of 
>95% were achieved from cyanidation leaching at grind sizes <75µm for the deposits listed above. These 
results were a basis for defining in 2014 a processing plant criteria. 
Reporting Cut-Off grade 
For Open Pit areas a Cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au was applied to all material within mineral resource defined 
specific open optimisation pit shells. 
For underground a cut-off grade of 2 g/t Au was applied to stope mining shapes.

Appendix 4: Information in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.8.1 for the Mt Egerton Mineral 
Resource Estimate 
Mineral Resource Estimation: data, methodology and parameters 
The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Mt Egerton Project was estimated in 2021 by Cube Consulting Pty 
Ltd (Cube) (ASX:SPR 31 May 2021). Estimation data, methodology and estimation parameters are explained 
in this section of the report with more details available in the JORC Table in Appendix 5.  
Drilling, Sampling, and Sample Analysis Methods 
MRE database contains 439 RC and DD drillholes at the Mt Egerton area (Figure 1.2) with depth of drilling 
in the range of 21 – 169m, mean 58.9m. 
Sampling was carried out under the sampling and QAQC protocols established by the previous project 
owners as per industry best practice. 
Database Compilation 
The Hibernian drilling data was supplied to Cube in a .CSV format. Cube compiled the data for importing 
into a standard resource database in MS Access for use in the January 2021 Mineral Resource estimate. 
Exploratory Data Analysis 
Statistical analysis was carried out for all domains, including a composite length, and grade capping 
analysis. Drillhole samples were composited to 1m composites, and the top cut was allied when estimated 
blocks were located outside a distance of 10m diameter (nominal drill spacing distance).  
Interpretation and Wireframing 
• 
At the Mt Egerton field the mineralisation present in the two areas, in the western part of the project 
(Gaffney’s find) it extends over a 2,000m and in the eastern part, where it was mapped for 
approximately 4500m from the Hibernian West prospect to the Maco prospect. 
• 
Depth of mineralisation is unknown, because the past drilling was shallow with average depth 
approximately 70m. Mineralisation is open at the depth. 
• 
14 mineralisation domains have been modelled for the 2021 MRE. 
Variography and Search Neighbourhood Analysis 
• 
Variogram calculations were carried out on the 1m composites for three well informed domains 
(1002, 1004, 1005). Variography failed to produce satisfactory results for other domains due to 
insufficient samples. 
Block Model Definition and Grade Estimation 
• 
The parent block dimensions used in the block model were: 
5 mE by 2.5 mN by 5 mRL, with sub-cells of 2.5 m by 1.25 m by 2.5 m. 
The parent block size was selected on the basis one half/one quarter of the minimum drill spacing of 
10/20 m E by 10 m N in Indicated areas and one quarter of the maximum drill spacing of 40 m E by 
20 m N in Inferred areas. 
• 
The parent block size and sub-blocking deemed appropriate for the mineralisation. 
• 
Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Inverse distance (ID2) were used for 2021 MRE. The drill spacing is 10m x 
10m in the central area, and 40mE x 20 mN at the eastern and western parts. Maximum extrapolation 
of wireframes from drilling was 20m along strike or 10m down-dip. Maximum extrapolation was 
generally half drill hole spacing. 
Block model validation 
Model validation did not reveal any significant issues. The validation procedures included:

• 
Gold Price assumption of A$2,800/oz 
• 
Wall angles of 50 degrees in fresh material 
For underground areas, mining stope shapes were generated based on 3m minimum mining width in all

Mt Egerton 
•
At Mt Egerton the drilling orientation changed depending on the preferred
structure controlling the gold mineralisation at the prospects. At Gaffney’s Find
most of the drillholes were drilled to the west with a dip – 60o. At Hibernian Mine,
the drilling was predominantly to the south with a dip -60o. The Mako prospect was
explored by drilling to the southeast (azi 145o) with a dip -60o.
•
MRE database contains 439 RC and DD drillholes at Mt Egerton (Figure 1.2) with
depth of drilling in the range of 21 – 169m, mean 58.9m.
•
Sampling procedures followed by historical operators are assumed to be in line
with industry standards at the time. Current QAQC protocols include the analysis
of field duplicates and the insertion of appropriate commercial standards.

disclosure of detailed information. 
Fire Assay. 
•
RC drilling was used to obtain 1m samples which were split by either cone or riffle
splitter at the rig to produce a 3 – 5kg sample for shipment to the laboratory where
it was analysed via 25g Fire Assay.
•
A 4m composite sample of approximately 3 – 5kg was collected for all AC and RAB
drilling. This was shipped to the laboratory for analysis via a 25g Aqua Regia digest
with reading via a mass spectrometer. Where anomalous results were detected,
single metre samples were collected for subsequent analysis via an Aqua Regia
digest. All samples were analysed.
Drilling 
techniques 
•
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc)
and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube,
depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type,
whether core is oriented and if so, by what method,
etc).
•
Exploration diamond core (DD) was HQ and NQ in size.
•
RC drilling used a nominal 5½ inch diameter face sampling hammer.
•
AC drilling used a conventional 3½ inch face sampling blade to refusal or a 4½ inch
face sampling hammer to a nominal depth.
•
RAB drilling used a conventional blade to refusal.
Drill 
sample 
recovery 
•
Method of recording and assessing core and chip
sample recoveries and results assessed.
•
DD sample recovery was estimated using a linear comparison method.
•
RC, AC and RAB sample recovery is visually assessed and recorded where
significantly reduced. Minimal sample loss has been noted.
•
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and
ensure representative nature of the samples.
•
RC samples were visually checked for recovery, moisture, and contamination. A
cyclone and splitter were used to provide a uniform sample, and these were
routinely cleaned. AC samples were visually checked for recovery moisture and
contamination. A cyclone was used and routinely cleaned. 4m composites were
speared to obtain a representative sample. RAB samples by nature may be
contaminated, however a visual assessment is made, and every effort is made to
obtain the most representative sample possible.
•
Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias may
have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of
fine/coarse material.
•
No significant sample loss has been recorded with a corresponding increase in Au
present.
•
Field duplicates produced consistent results. No sample bias is anticipated, and no
preferential loss/gain of grade material has been noted.
Logging 
•
Whether core and chip samples have been
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of
detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.
•
RC chips are geologically logged in metre intervals. AC and RAB chips are logged
to geological boundaries. Diamond core, RC chip trays and end of hole chips for AC
and RAB drilling have been stored for future reference.

Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and 
sample 
preparation 
•
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half
or all core taken.
•
Diamond core was half core sampled. The core was cut using an automatic core
saw, to divide the mineralisation consistently down the hole.
•
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split,
etc and whether sampled wet or dry.
•
RC chips were riffle or cone split at the rig. AC and RAB samples were collected as
1m composites (unless otherwise noted) using a spear of the drill spoil. Samples
were dry.
•
For all sample types, the nature, quality and
appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.
•
For diamond core, the rock is dried then crushed to ~10mm followed by
pulverisation of the sample to a grind size where 85% of the sample passes 75
micron. For RC, AC and RAB samples, the material is dried, riffle split if the sample
is greater than 3kg, then pulverised to a grind size where 85% of the sample passes 
75 microns.
•
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of
samples.
•
Field QAQC procedures included the insertion of 4% certified reference material
and 2% field duplicates for RC drilling and some AC drilling. Standards and
duplicates were not inserted during RAB drilling or for diamond core.
•
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is
representative of the in-situ material collected,
including 
for 
instance 
results 
for 
field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
•
QAQC protocols include the analysis of field duplicates and the insertion of
appropriate certified reference ‘standards’ and ‘blanks’.
•
Field duplicates were collected during RC drilling and some AC drilling. Historical
diamond core has been recut to quarter core and re-assayed. No significant
differences were detected.
•
Based on statistical analysis of these results, there is no evidence to suggest the
samples are not representative.
•
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain
size of the material being sampled.
•
A sample size of between 3kg and 5kg was collected. This size is considered
appropriate, and representative of the material being sampled given the width and
continuity of the intersections, and the grain size of the material being collected.
Quality of assay 
data 
and 
laboratory tests 
•
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the
assaying and laboratory procedures used and
whether the technique is considered partial or total.
•
All diamond and RC samples, and some AC samples, were analysed using a 25g
charge Fire Assay with an AAS finish which is an industry standard for gold analysis.
A 25g aqua regia digest with an MS finish has been used for some AC and all RAB
samples. Aqua regia is considered total for a conventional free milling gold
mineralisation, which was identified at the Glenburgh and Mt Egerton fields and

•
No adjustments have been made to assay data apart from values below the
detection limit, which are assigned a value of negative the detection limit. Prior to
Mineral Resource estimation, these values were changed to half the detection limit.
Location of data 
points 
•
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill
holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine
workings and other locations used in Mineral
Resource estimation.
•
Diamond and RC drill hole collars are routinely picked up by MHR Surveyors to an
accuracy of 0.02m Easting and Northing, and 0.05m elevation. AC and RAB holes
are located by hand-held GPS with an accuracy of about 5m. Diamond and RC
holes have a downhole survey at least every 30m with a single shot camera tool,
with many holes having been surveyed with a DMS camera every 5m.

The grid system is MGA_GDA94 Zone 50, although a local grid was used at some
prospects representing MGA_GDA94 Zone 50 rotated along the mineralisation
strike

deposits, hence the drillhole collars were deemed the best representation of the true 
surface for these prospects and these were used for creating their topographic 
surfaces. 
Data spacing and 
distribution 
•
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
•
The Projects have been drilled on a nominal 25m x 25m or 25m x 50m grid. In areas 
of greenfield exploration, the target size and position determine the drill hole density,
although drill holes are generally spaced at 25m intervals along grid lines.
•
Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient
to establish the degree of geological and grade
continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and
Ore 
Reserve 
estimation 
procedure(s) 
and
classifications applied.
•
The drilling data spacing is adequate to determine the geological and grade
continuity for reporting of Mineral Resources.
•
Whether sample compositing has been applied.
•
4m physical composites were collected during RAB and some AC drilling. The
composites included 4 samples of 1m length each.
Orientation 
of 
data in relation to 
geological 
structure 
•
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves
unbiased sampling of possible structures and the
extent to which this is known, considering the deposit
type.
•
Drilling sections are orientated perpendicular to the strike of the mineralised host
rocks at Glenburgh and Mt Egerton fields. Orientation of drilling allows to achieve
unbiased sampling.
•
At the Glenburgh the drilling, angled at -60°, provides close to perpendicular
intersections of the mineralised lodes.
•
Drilling at the Mt Egerton area prospects intersects a steeply dipping mineralisation
at the higher angles, although this is acceptable for accurate assessment of the
Mineral Resources
•
If the relationship between the drilling orientation and
the orientation of key mineralised structures is
considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this
should be assessed and reported if material.
•
No orientation-based sampling bias has been identified in the Glenburgh – Mt
Egerton data, allowing to conclude that orientation of the drilling didn’t cause the
sampling biases.
Sample security

Deposit type, geological setting and style of 
mineralisation. 
• 
The Glenburgh and Mt Egerton Projects area consists of an ENE trending 
Paleoproterozoic sequence of highly metamorphosed and migmatised sediments  
• 
At the Glenburgh the host sequence is dominated by pelitic metasediments, now 
quartz, feldspar, biotite, ± garnet, ±magnetite gneiss, with interlayered quartz, 
quartzite, calc-silicate, and amphibolite (Figure 2.2). Gold occurs in quartz- 
feldspar- biotite-garnet gneiss with a general observation of higher grades 
occurring in silica “flooded” zones. 
 
 
Figure 2.2. Detailed geological map of the Glenburgh field (GCY, 2021)

At Mt Egerton the gold mineralisation is hosted within the Lower Proterozoic 
Egerton inlier which is comprised of greenschist facies metamorphosed flysch 
sequence 
intercalated 
with 
mafic 
volcanics 
and

rocks. 
Mineralisation generally strikes southwest and traversed by numerous shear-
zones striking to the north and north-northeast.

In 
reporting 
Exploration 
Results, 
weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum 
grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and 
cut-off grades are usually Material and should be 
stated. 
• 
All reported assays have been length weighted if appropriate. No top cuts have 
been applied. A nominal 0.5ppm Au lower cut-off has been applied and allowing 
5m interval waste. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short 
lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of 
low grade results, the procedure used for such 
aggregation should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should be shown in 
detail. 
 
• 
High grade Au intervals lying within broader zones of Au mineralisation are 
reported as included intervals. In calculating the zones of mineralisation, a 
maximum of 4m of internal dilution is allowed. 
 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal 
equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
• 
Metal equivalent values have not been used. Only gold grade is reported. 
Relationship between 
mineralisation widths 
and intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
The mineralised horizons at Glenburgh strike approximately 065/245° and dip 
approximately 70° to the NW. 
• 
At the Mt Egerton field, mineralisation trends are as follows: 
o Hibernian: Approximately ENE in strike and dips steeply to the NNW. 
o Gaffney’s Find: Approximately NNE in strike and dips moderately to the ESE. 
o Mako: Approximately NE in strike and dips steeply to the NW. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to 
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be 
reported. 
• 
Drill holes at the Glenburgh, drilled towards 155° with a dip -60° are close to 
perpendicular to the mineralisation. 
• 
Drilling at the Mt Egerton area prospects intersects a steeply dipping 
mineralisation at the higher angles

Preliminary metallurgical results at Glenburgh: In 2013, Asburton Hall 
Metallurgical Consulting managed test work performed at ALS. Three recovery 
tests were conducted on 1kg sub samples of homogenised RC chips from hole 
VRC579 metres 210 to 240 (Zone 126). The samples were subjected to a primary 
grind of 75µm, then put through a Knelson concentrator for gravity recovery. The 
gravity tail was then subjected to standard cyanide bottle roll leach test with 
residence of 24 hours. The results demonstrated an average extraction recovery 
of 96.8% after 24 hours. The results are summarised in Table 1 below. These

Geological 
Interpretation 
• 
Confidence in (or conversely, the uncertainty of) 
the geological interpretation of the mineral 
deposit. 
Glenburgh 
• 
The confidence in the geological interpretation of the Glenburgh prospects is 
high as a result of density of drilling approximately 25x25m. This was 
confirmed by a recent infill drilling programs and also by observations made 
in the outcrops. 
• 
Continued drilling has shown that the approximate tenor and thickness of 
mineralisation is predictable within predominantly broad foliated and gneissic 
granitic rocks 
• 
As the deposit has good grade and geological continuity the CP regards the 
confidence in the geological interpretation is appropriate for accurate 
estimation of the Mineral Resources. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
Confidence in geological interpretation is high which is based on drilling 
density, in average 25 x 25m spacings. Geological interpretation deduced 
from the optimally spaced RC drilling is supported by the surface exploration, 
and historical underground (UG) mining activities, including the mine 
production data.

alteration, and mineralisation.  
• 
The effect, if any, of alternative interpretations on 
Mineral Resource estimation. 
Glenburgh 
• 
Previous interpretations and modelling of sub-vertical to steeply dipping high 
grade metamorphic gneiss have been confirmed by recent infill RC drilling 
and deep diamond drill core. The recent drilling has supported and refined the 
model to be more robust, with less isolated and narrow mineralisation 
domains interpreted. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
Previous geological interpretations (Holmes, 2005) were based on the notion 
that the mineralisation is constrained to shear hosted, quartz- pyrite-
carbonate veins and vein selvedges within a predominantly mafic host-rock. 
At Hibernian, the steeply dipping shear zone is up to 70m wide and comprises 
several discrete shears which anastomose about common trends of 270-
290°. Multiple phases of deformation have occurred, and several orientations 
of quartz veins have been identified. High-grade gold mineralisation is best 
developed along shallowly plunging quartz shoots. Vein geometry and grades 
of the shallowly plunging shoots are supported by underground geological 
mapping and mining. 
• 
The best developed shoot is defined over 100m strike length however typical 
strike length is around 20m. Mineralisation continuity between shallowly 
plunging quartz shoots is good at very low grades, and poor at high-grades 
and appears to be associated with thin veins and faults within the broad shear 
zone. 
• 
The RC and DD drilling to date mainly comprises angled holes which tested 
for shear parallel sheet veins rather than for shallow plunging shoots. Due to 
this (vector) data gap, it was extremely difficult to construct continuous wire 
frames that reflected the individual high-grade quartz veins and therefore the 
estimation was undertaken unconstrained within the broadly defined shear 
zone. 
• 
As a result of the findings from previous work, the extent and projection of 
high-grade mineralisation has been considered in the 2021 mineralisation 
domain modelling. Mineralisation 
interpretations 
have 
been 
tightly 
constrained with projections limited to half drill spacing past the last drilling

The use of geology in guiding and controlling 
Mineral Resource estimation. 
• 
Regional aeromagnetic (TMI survey) data has previously been used to 
extrapolate and interpret the geology emphasising the major fault structures. 
This includes a NE trending Deadmans Fault and associated parallel faults 
and splays apparently offsetting the ENE-WSW mineralisation trends with 
sinistral movement.   
• 
At both fields, Glenburgh and Mt Egerton, a surface geology mapping 
provides a good exposure to the host lithologies and structures that control 
mineralisation

UG backs mapping of development and rises was registered by Gascoyne 
and provided for interpretation and 3DM wireframing of mineralisation 
domains. 
• 
The factors affecting continuity both of grade and 
geology. 
Glenburgh 
• 
The bulk of the mineralisation in the Glenburgh field is distributed along a 
discontinuous ENE trending structures, mainly anastomosing shear-zones, 
cutting the Paleoproterozoic sequence of high metamorphic grade Quartz-
Biotite-Feldspar-Garnet gneisses and schists intercalated with amphibolites. 
• 
The Zone 126 mineralisation of the Glenburgh gold field clearly displays a 
steep SW high grade plunge, open at depth. This plunge orientation has not 
been identified in other deposits and to date is not well understood. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
At Mt Egerton, the host rocks are represented by the flysch sequence 
metamorphosed at the PT conditions of the greenschist facies of regional 
metamorphism.  
• 
The bulk of the mineralisation has been constrained within two distinct 
mineralised shear zones either 270° or 290° local grid. High-grade shoots 
within the mineralisation plunge at 10° W 
• 
Discontinuous linking shears within the main shear zones may contain high 
grade mineralisation. 
• 
Mineralisation is continuous for up to 350m (northern shear zone) along strike, 
and approximately 25m parallel to the high-grade lunging shoots. 
• 
Gold mineralisation is restricted parallel to the shear orientations, with vertical 
truncations or terminations interpretated as structure offsets (faults) or 
complex folding or plunging shoots

The Glenburgh Mineral Resource area extends over a strike length of 
13,000 m (from 4,450 mE – 17,450 mE)  
• 
Mineralisation has been defined over three zones:  
o 
North East (NE) Zone strike extent ~2,420 m and a vertical depth extent 
currently defined at ~450 m (325 mRL to -125 mRL). Four prospects 
make up the NE Zone – Zone 126, Zone 102, Hurricane and North East 
3. 
o 
Central Zone strike extent ~3,350 m and a vertical depth extent currently 
defined at 300 m (300 mRL to 0 mRL); Five prospects make up the 
Central Zone – Icon, Apollo, Tuxedo, Mustang-Cobra, Shelby. 
o 
South West (SW) Zone strike extent ~3,050 m and a vertical depth extent 
currently defined at 150 m (285 mRL to 135 mRL); The zone includes 
Torino and Thunderbolt prospects. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
At the Mt Egerton field, gold mineralisation was identified in the two areas. At 
the western part (Gaffney’s Find) it extends over a strike length of 2,000m and 
in the eastern part it extends for approximately for 4500m from the Hibernian 
West to Maco prospects. 
• 
Depth of mineralisation is unknown, because the past drilling was shallow with 
average depth approximately 70m. Mineralisation is open at the depth. 
• 
14 mineralisation domains have been modelled for the 2021 MRE, with 11 
domains modelled in central or main Hibernian Mine (northern and southern 
zones). New interpretations have included a significant west extension (2 
domains over 250m strike length), and minor zones to the east and west.

Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Local Uniform Conditioning (LUC) were the 
estimation methods used for the Glenburgh deposits. Most good quality 
drilling within each zone is on regular drill spacing – 25/50m x 25m for the NE

included several broader mineralisation domains (+25m true thickness). This 
estimation method was used as it attempts to provide better local grade 
estimation for mining evaluation. This method estimates a block grade into 
each SMU. 
• 
OK Estimation was used for all other much smaller and narrower 
mineralisation domains for the NE, Central, and all SW Zone domains.  The 
domains estimated using OK mostly have far less concentrated drilling and 
data points which are more suitable to OK method. 
Domaining and Compositing:  
• 
The estimation domains are informed by good quality drilling within each zone 
on regular drill spacing – 25/50m x 25m for the NE and Central Zones, and 
50m x 25m for the SW Zone. Maximum extrapolation of wireframes from 
drilling was 50m down-dip. Maximum extrapolation was generally half drill 
hole spacing. 
• 
The 3DM mineralisation domains acted as hard boundaries for later grade 
interpolation. A broad waste domain halo was created tightly around the drill 
limits and domain extents for each zone. 
• 
Drill hole sample data was flagged using domain codes generated from 3D 
mineralisation domains. Sample data was composited over the full downhole 
interval. Intervals with no assays were assigned background grades for the 
compositing routine as these un-assayed intervals in the drill holes were 
assumed to be waste. 
• 
Assessment of the raw assay interval lengths and raw gold assay values were 
completed in order to determine the most appropriate length for compositing 
of the samples.  The most common sample length is 1.0m and covers the 
range of the Au grades. Therefore, 1m composes were used as the source 
data for the gold grade estimates. 
• 
All domain composites included coding by weathering for oxide/transition 
versus fresh material. Statistical analysis of grade distribution for the well-
informed domains by weathering was conducted, mainly to assess if further 
sub-domaining was required (e.g., evidence of supergene enrichment). No 
consistent variability in the sub-domaining by weathering was noted across 
the zones.

determine if high grade cuts or distance limiting should be applied. Distance 
limiting thresholds and the effects of grade capping were reviewed and 
applied on a domain basis where it was deemed appropriate i.e. for extreme 
high-grade outliers, high grade clustering or ahigh coefficient of variation 
(CV). 
Grade Interpolation and Search Parameters: 
•
The mineralised domain wireframes were used to code the block model and
the volume between the wireframe models and the coded block model were
checked in order to ensure that the sub-blocking size are appropriate for the
interpreted domains.
•
Estimation was carried out on capped and uncapped gold grade. Hard domain
boundaries were used between the mineralised domains, meaning only
composites within the domain are used to estimate inside that domain. The
variogram orientations were used as the orientation of the search ellipse.
•
Gold was estimated in two passes – first pass using optimum search
distances for each domain (mostly 150m) as determined through the KNA
process, second pass set at longer distances in order to populate all blocks
(2nd = max 300m).
•
A waste domain boundary encompassing the mineralisation domains and
within the limits of the drilling and host units was modelled for each deposit
and included in the grade estimation runs. This allowed for any isolated zones 
and any mineralised haloes proximal to the hard boundary mineralised blocks
to be estimated for estimation of dilution within pit optimisation limits.
•
Interpolation parameters were set to a minimum number of 6 or 8 composites
and a maximum number of 16 or 20 composites for the estimate. A maximum
of 5 samples per hole was used.
LUC estimation: 
•
The initial step in a LUC estimation is undertaken using the OK method to
estimate into relatively large Panels (10m E x 10m N x 10m RL) and therefore 
can be considered as being ‘diluted’, as the Panels are estimated using all
data within a broad mineralised envelope incorporating sub-grade and waste
material.
•
A Change of Support (CoS) correction is then applied to the large, diluted
panels in order to predict the likely grade-tonnage distribution at single mining 
unit (SMU) of 5m E x 5m N x 5m RL selectivity within each Panel.

The influence of extreme grade values was reduced by applying a grade- 
distance threshold limit for the estimation domains containing high grade 
outliers. Outside a distance of 10 m diameter (nominal drill spacing distance), 
a top cut was applied to the estimation domains.

Egerton field.  
• 
Metallurgical test work was carried out on samples from Zone 102, Zone 126, 
Icon, and Apollo deposits.

This test work indicated significant gravity recoverable gold (~50%) was 
evident in the tested ore samples. Total gold recoveries of >95% were

Bulk density 
• 
Whether assumed or determined. If assumed, the 
basis for the assumptions. If determined, the 
method used, whether wet or dry, the frequency 
of the measurements, the nature, size and 
representativeness of the samples. 
Glenburgh 
• 
Bulk densities of 2.50 t/m3 for oxide, 2.55 t/m3 for transitional, 2.79 t/m3 for 
fresh waste and 2.82 t/m3 for fresh mineralisation have been assumed in all 
models.  These densities were determined after averaging the bulk density 
measurements obtained from core and from metallurgical testwork, and bulk 
density testwork taken from geotechnical test pits over the deposits. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
Bulk densities (BD) are assumed based on a previously reported BD 
assignments collated with BD samples and measurements. The assigned 
values are dry BD values and are based on the assigned BDs used for the 
2005 resource work (Holmes, 2005). 
• 
Holmes (2005) reported that density measurements were taken on numerous 
mineralised samples of drill core and the data were analysed by AMMTEC. 
• 
The bulk density for bulk material must have been 
measured by methods that adequately account for 
void spaces (vugs, porosity, etc), moisture and 
differences between rock and alteration zones 
within the deposit. 
• 
Bulk density at Glenburgh is measured. Moisture is accounted for in the 
measuring process and measurements were separated for lithology and 
mineralisation. It is assumed there are no void spaces in the rocks at 
Glenburgh as the rock observed in drill core is fresh and competent.  
• 
Regarding Mt Egerton, descriptions of the BD methodology have not been 
found, hence rational of the AMMTEC determinations is unclear. 
• 
Discuss assumptions for bulk density estimates 
used in the evaluation process of the different 
materials. 
• 
It is assumed that the bulk density will have little variation within the separate 
material types across the breadth of the project area. Therefore, a single value 
applied to each material type is considered acceptable. 
• 
For the 2021 MRE, Cube assigned BD values (g/cm3) for laterite, oxide and 
transitional material for both ore and waste. Fresh material is based in the BD

Classification 
Resources into varying confidence categories. 
Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves’ by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC). 
The resource was classified as Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resource 
based on data quality, sample spacing, and lode continuity.   
• 
The Indicated Mineral Resource was defined within areas of close spaced 
diamond and RC drilling of less than 25m by 25m (20x20m at Mt Egerton), 
and where the continuity and predictability of the lode positions was good.   
• 
The Inferred Mineral Resource was assigned to areas of the deposit where 
drill hole spacing was greater than 25m by 25m (greater then 20x20m at Mt 
Egerton) and where small, isolated pods of mineralisation occur outside the 
main mineralised trends. 
• 
Whether appropriate account has been taken of 
all relevant factors (i.e. relative confidence in 
tonnage/grade estimations, reliability of input 
data, confidence in continuity of geology and 
metal values, quality, quantity and distribution of 
the data). 
• 
The resource classification is based on the quality of information for the drill 
types (more recent RC and DD), geological domaining, as well as the drill 
spacing and geostatistical measures to provide confidence in the tonnage and 
grade estimates 
• 
The input data is comprehensive in its coverage of the mineralisation and 
does not favour or misrepresent in-situ mineralisation. The definition of 
mineralised zones is based on high level geological understanding producing 
a robust model of mineralised domains.  
• 
Validation of the block model shows good correlation of the input data to the 
estimated grades. 
• 
Whether the result appropriately reflects the 
Competent Person’s view of the deposit. 
• 
The Mineral Resource estimate appropriately reflects the Competent 
Person’s view of the deposit. 
Audits or reviews 
• 
The results of any audits or reviews of Mineral 
Resource estimates. 
• 
The 2014 MRE was reviewed by Cube in 2020 with the main 
recommendations noted as follows: 
o 
Amendments recommended to domain interpretations specifically 
where very narrow high-grade domains with inconsistent trends, inside 
lower grade domain haloes occur Recommend LUC estimation 
method which is considered an appropriate method for the estimation 
of local recoverable resources appropriate for open pit mining SMU. 
o 
Re-assess the criteria for Resource classification for future MRE; 
recommendation to remove Measured category due to data spacing; 
conversion of Inferred resources to Indicated based on infill drilling 
programs completed since the 2014 MRE, and increased confidence 
in the geological and grade continuity as a result of diamond drill core.

Commentary 
• 
The current estimation domaining, MRE parameters, classification and 
reporting have all been internally peer reviewed by qualified professionals at 
Cube. 
Discussion of relative 
accuracy/ confidence 
• 
Where appropriate a statement of the relative 
accuracy and confidence level in the Mineral 
Resource estimate using an approach or 
procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent 
Person. For example, the application of statistical 
or geostatistical procedures to quantify the relative 
accuracy of the resource within stated confidence 
limits, or, if such an approach is not deemed 
appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors 
that could affect the relative accuracy and 
confidence of the estimate. 
Glenburgh 
• 
The addition of recent infill RC and DD drill data has provided further 
enhancement to the accuracy and confidence in the MRE for the three zones 
at Glenburgh. This information has increased the knowledge of the geological 
continuity on mineralisation which has been used to develop the current MRE. 
The addition of the LUC estimation provides a better estimate of local grade 
estimate for open pit mining evaluation over OK estimation and is also a 
robust estimate for a broad bulk mineralised zone within which local variability 
in grade will be high. Outside of the main deposits within Icon, Apollo, Zone 
126 and Zone 102, local variations can be expected within the interpreted 
mineralised domains where drilling to date is more broadly spaced.  The use 
of OK has assisted in reducing the risk associated with any high nugget 
observed in the gold distribution.  
• 
The deposit geometry and continuity has been adequately interpreted to 
reflect the applied level for Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. The 
data quality is good, and the drill holes have detailed logs produced by 
qualified geologists. A recognised laboratory has been used for all analyses. 
 
Mt Egerton 
• 
The Mt Egerton 2021 MRE is made up predominantly of moderately thick to 
narrow, very continuous mineralised gold zones hosted within sheared 
alteration zones containing high grade quartz veining. 
• 
The close density of drilling supports the classification of 93% of the Mineral 
Resource to be classified as Indicated (by contained metal). 
• 
The deposit geometry and continuity has been adequately interpreted to 
reflect the applied level for Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. The 
data quality is good, and the drill holes have detailed logs produced by 
qualified geologists. A recognised laboratory has been used for all analyse 
 
• 
The statement should specify whether it relates to 
global or local estimates, and, if local, state the 
relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to 
technical 
and 
economic 
evaluation. 
• 
Confidence in the 2020 MRE of Glenburgh and 2021 MRE of Mt Egerton is 
such that it will provide adequate accuracy for global resource evaluation and 
for more detailed evaluation at a large scale for open pit mining, and further 
evaluation of UG resources at Zone 126.
