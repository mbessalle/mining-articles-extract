BACKGROUND ON SPARTAN RESOURCES 
Spartan Resources Limited (ASX: SPR) is an ASX-listed gold company that is pursuing a focused high-grade 
gold exploration and development strategy centred on the 100%-owned Dalgaranga Gold Project, located 
65km north-west of Mt Magnet in the Murchison Region of Western Australia.  
Spartan has overseen a remarkable turnaround of the Dalgaranga Project – which produced over 70,000oz of 
gold in FY2022 prior to an operational reset in November 2022 commencing with placing the previous low 
grade open pit mining operations on care & maintenance.  
The discovery of the high-grade Never Never and Pepper Gold Deposits, less than 1km from the existing 
2.5Mtpa CIL processing plant and infrastructure, has been instrumental in this turnaround – underpinning a 
fresh vision and new approach based on the delineation of high-grade ounces close to existing infrastructure.  
The Never Never and Pepper gold deposits are one of Australia’s most exciting new gold discoveries, with a 
combined high-grade underground Mineral Resource Estimate of 2.32Moz (7.76Mt at 9.32g/t) – including an 
Indicated classification of 1.87Moz (5.92Mt at 9.81g/t) – and remains open along strike and at depth. The 
recently discovered Freak Prospect is located 110 metres south of Pepper, in the vicinity of the planned 
underground infrastructure which is currently being developed.  
Spartan Resources is focused on continuing to deliver high-grade ounces at its flagship Dalgaranga Gold 
Project as the foundation for a sustainable long-term operating plan that will deliver strong returns for all key 
stakeholders.  
Spartan is committed to safe and respectful operation as a professional and considerate organisation within a 
diverse and varied community. Our people represent our culture and our culture is always to show respect to 
each other and to our community, to respect the unique environment we operate within and to show respect 
to all of our various stakeholders. This is reinforced by our core SPARTA values:
