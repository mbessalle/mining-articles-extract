Overview of the Empress Springs Project
Moho listed on the ASX in 2018 with the Empress Springs Project Joint Venture with IGO
under which Moho could earn up to a 70% interest in three mineral exploration permits:
EPM25208, EPM25209, and EPM25210. Following its IPO, the Company conducted
exploration programs that fulfilled the relevant earn-in requirements according to the Joint
Venture Agreement. Additionally, Moho staked adjoining tenements (EPMs 27193 - 27200
and EPMs 27816 - 27821), which expanded the land size of the Empress Springs Project.
The project encompasses remote tenements with high exploration costs, which do not
align with the Company's financial strategy and capacity. Furthermore, the administrative
obligations have consumed significant time and resources.
