(TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) (\"<b>Talon</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an exclusivity agreement with Lundin Mining Corporation (\"<b>Lundin Mining</b>\") as the parties negotiate an earn-in agreement (the \"<b>Option Agreement</b>\") pursuant to which Lundin Mining may acquire up to a 70% ownership interest in the Boulderdash and Roland exploration targets (the \"<b>Optioned</b> <b>Properties</b>\"), which are in close proximity to Lundin Mining's Eagle Mine.  </p><p>Lundin Mining has advanced Talon US$5 million (the \"<b>Advance Payment</b>\") to, among other things, commence drilling on the Optioned Properties as soon as the Option Agreement is entered into.  </p><p>In the event that Talon and Lundin Mining do not enter into the Option Agreement for any reason by March 31, 2025 (or such earlier or later date as agreed between the parties), Talon will at its sole election either, (i) repay the Advance Payment in cash, or (ii) issue Lundin Mining that number of common shares of Talon (the <b>\"Talon Shares\"</b>) equal to the Advance Payment at a deemed price per Talon Share based on the 5-day volume weighted average trading price of the Talon Shares on the TSX at such time.  The issuance of common shares of Talon is subject to receipt of the approval of the TSX and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.</p><p>This announcement builds on Talon's exploration success with its discovery at Boulderdash in October 2024 and additional successful drilling (see the Company's press releases dated <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/R75BbSqGea\">October 24, 2024</a> and <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/W0wPbuQyko\">February 27, 2025</a>). The Optioned Properties consist of approximately 33,000 acres out of Talon's over 400,000 acre mineral package in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (the \"<b>Michigan Land Package</b>\").</p><p><u><b>Proposed Option Agreement Terms</b></u></p><p>The proposed Option Agreement is expected to contain the following terms:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Talon will provide Lundin Mining with the right to acquire up to a 70% ownership interest in the Optioned Properties. </li></ul><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>Lundin Mining will agree to fund up to 30,000 meters of Talon's drilling campaign at the Optioned Properties. </p><ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><p>After each 10,000 meters of drilling by Talon on the Optioned Properties, Lundin Mining will have the election whether or not to proceed further with their earn-in. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Talon is currently earning up to an 80% interest in the Michigan Land Package (which includes the Optioned Properties) from UPX Minerals Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sweetwater Royalties). Once Talon has earned a 51% interest in the Michigan Land Package that is expected to be fulfilled by the drilling Talon will do on the Optioned Properties with Lundin Mining, Lundin Mining will earn a 44.625% interest solely in the Optioned Properties.</p></li><li><p>Following the completion of 30,000 meters of drilling on the Optioned Properties, Lundin Mining may fund a feasibility study in respect of any portion of the Optioned Properties in exchange for an additional 25.375% interest, for a total ownership of 70% in the Optioned Properties.  Talon will retain a 10% ownership interest in the Optioned Properties, with the remainder owned by UPX Minerals.</p></li></ul><p><i>\"Talon continues to respond to the call for responsible production of critical minerals in the United States, specifically nickel for defence and national security purposes. The proposed transaction with Lundin Mining is part of Talon's strategy to continue to build Talon's integrated drilling and geophysics business to generate cashflow to progress the feasibility study and permitting of the Tamarack Mining Project in Minnesota and its Battery Minerals Processing Facility in North Dakota.
