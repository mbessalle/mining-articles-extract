    "source_text": "\"Up to a maximum $100.0 million in deferred consideration may be payable to Newmont in cash through a gold price linked payment structure with a 50% price upside participation by Newmont in respect of gold produced from Havieron for 5 calendar years following the declaration of commercial production, subject to a hurdle price of $1,850/oz. Deferred consideration for the relevant year will be equal to 50% x (market price \u2013 hurdle price) x sum of total gold sold for the relevant year (inc. dor\u00e9 and concentrate), subject to the annual cap and the total cap. The applicable annual cap is $50 million and the total cap is $100 million.\"",
    "additional_details": "This 50% is part of a \"deferred contingent cash consideration\" and a \"gold price linked payment structure\" for the Havieron project. It is described as \"50% price upside participation\" and is calculated based on the difference between the market price of gold and a hurdle price ($1,850/oz), multiplied by the total gold sold. While not explicitly termed an \"NSR\" or \"royalty\", it functions as a contingent payment tied to production volume and commodity price, which is a common characteristic of royalty-like agreements. The payment is subject to an annual cap of $50 million and a total cap of $100 million over 5 calendar years following commercial production.",
