ASX RELEASE
19 July 2024
NewPeak to Acquire Treuer Range Uranium-
Vanadium Project, Northern Territory
HIGHLIGHTS
• NewPeak wishes to inform its shareholders and the market that it has entered into a binding term
sheet on 18 July 2024 to acquire the Treuer Range Uranium-Vanadium Project in the Northern
Territory, Australia.
• The consideration for the acquisition is $350,000 by way of the issue of 23,333,333 NPM shares at an
issue price of $0.015 (1.5 cents) per share, and the granting of a 2% net smelter royalty to the Vendor,
with buyout provisions favourable to NewPeak.
• The Treuer Range Project is located in the Northern Territory’s Ngalia Basin. It surrounds the Bigrlyi
Uranium-Vanadium Deposit where a JORC Indicated and Inferred mineral resource of 7.5 MT grading
0.13% U O and 1.12% V O has been defined within the Mount Eclipse Sandstone. (The Bigrlyi
3 8 2 5
Deposit is held by other parties and is excluded from the Treuer Range project).
• The Vendors of the Treuer Range Project, consisting of four senior Australian geologists with a
combined exploration experience of some 200 years, determined the ground has the potential for
structural repetitions and strike extensions of Bigrlyi-style Uranium-Vanadium mineralisation, with
much of the project's southern portion has concealed drainages that may be prospective for
paleochannel-type Uranium.
• Airborne radiometric data shows several anomalous responses associated with the Mount Eclipse
Sandstone in the central and eastern parts of the project, which mirror the radiometric footprint of
Bigrlyi. Also, there are several subtle Uranium responses associated with Quaternary sediments that
overlie the Mount Eclipse Sandstone in the project’s western, central, and eastern parts. These
responses justify further investigations.
NewPeak Metals Ltd (ASX:NPM) (NewPeak or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has executed
a Binding Term Sheet with Yacimiento Pty Ltd (Vendor) to acquire the Treuer Range Uranium-Vanadium
Project (EL 33611) in the Northern Territory, Australia. NewPeak has completed the legal, financial and
technical due diligence investigations of the Treuer Range Project, is satisfied with the results, and is now
moving to finalise a formal sale agreement, with a view to progressing to completion of the transaction
within several weeks.
This acquisition will mark the next significant step of the Company’s rejuvenation plans in entering the
strategic critical minerals space and provides NewPeak with a unique opportunity in an excellent
jurisdiction that complements the recent acquisition of its Canadian George River Uranium and Rare
Earths Elements Project, and its ongoing search for other critical mineral projects in prime jursidictions.
The Company is confident that the recent Finland, Sweden and New Zealand projects sales, the successful
$500,000 Placement and $529,811 Entitlement Issue capital raisings, and additional future assets sales
provide both immediate cash, as well as the receipt of staged cash payments and tradeable shares over
the near to medium term, to support both the Company’s exploration plans for these critical mineral
properties and its expansion plans.

TREUER RANGE PROJECT
The Treuer Range Project includes Exploration Licence (EL) 3361, which is located in the Northern
Territory’s Ngalia Basin (Figure 1), one of Australia’s most promising basins for sandstone-hosted
Uranium, some associated with Vanadium. Covering 230.7 km2, the Treuer Range tenement is prospective
for sandstone-type Uranium-Vanadium mineralisation associated with the Carboniferous Mount Eclipse
Sandstone.
The project is located 315 km northwest of Alice Springs (Figure 1). It surrounds the Bigrlyi (pronounced
"Big-a-lee") Uranium-Vanadium deposit, which includes the Uranium-Vanadium resources at BigWest and
A15E. The current JORC Indicated and Inferred resources at Bigrlyi are 7.5 Mt grading 0.13% U O and
3 8
1.12% V O , for 9,600 t U O and 8,900 t V O at a cut-off grade of 500 ppm for both metal oxides (Energy
2 5 3 8 2 5
Metals Ltd, ASX announcement, 28 June 2011). Most resources are within 200 m of the surface and are
potentially accessible via open-cut mining, with potential to increase resources at depth and along strike
at all the current resource areas.
Figure 1: General Location Map of the Treuer Range Project in the Northern Territory, Australia.
The Bigrlyi Deposit is secured by three granted Exploration Licences in Retention (ELR 31754, 31755 &
32552), owned by other parties (Figure 2). These licences are excluded from the Treuer Range Project.
The Treuer Range Project has the potential for structural repetitions and strike extensions of Bigrlyi-style
Uranium-Vanadium mineralisation hosted within the Mount Eclipse Sandstone (Figure 2). Much of the
project’s southern and southwestern portions has old drainage systems that may have the potential for
paleochannel-type Uranium, but have been underexplored due to Quaternary cover, which obscures the
drainages and any likely radiometric responses.
Recent historic exploration confirms that Uranium mineralisation also occurs at higher (younger)
stratigraphic levels in the Mount Eclipse Sandstone, as opposed to the basal sequence that hosts the
2

Bigrlyi Deposit (Kerr and Lui, 2016). This significantly increases the Mount Eclipse Sandstone’s
prospectivity, as there are more stratigraphic levels able to host Uranium-Vanadium mineralisation than
previously thought.
Airborne radiometric maps show several Uranium responses in the tenement's western, eastern, and
southern parts (Figure 3). These seem to be associated with the Mount Eclipse Sandstone, and while
highly significant, most remain untested and justify investigation.

NEWPEAK’S FUTURE EXPLORATION PLANS
NewPeak intends to conduct exploration at the Treuer Range Project, with the objective of
defining JORC mineral resources. The exploration program would include:
• A detailed review and evaluation of historic exploration including a reinterpretation of
geochemical, airborne, and ground geophysical and drill hole-derived data.
• The acquisition and interpretation of ASTER or other high-definition satellite imagery.
• Reconnaissance geochemical sampling (including portable XRF), scintillometer transverse
and broad-scale geological mapping. Geochemical samples will be submitted for multi-
element analyses, including a suite of indicator elements for Bigrlyi-style Uranium-
Vanadium.
• Priority areas would be followed up with wide-spaced, low-detection soil sampling, and
areas with shallow cover tested by trenching, RAB and/or aircore drilling.
• Ground geophysical surveys such as magnetics, radiometric, and IP, or even Sub-Audio
Magnetics (SAM), may be carried out over potential areas to better define geology and
mineralised zones.
• RC drilling will test the mineral potential at priority areas, and to improve the geological
understanding.
4

• Infill RC and diamond core drilling to define JORC Resources and obtain samples for
metallurgical test work.
The company expects this exploration program to begin in the second half of 2024, subject to
statutory approvals.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
NewPeak and the Company’s Competent Person recognize that these historic exploration results have
not been reported in accordance with JORC Code 2012 and a Competent Person has not done sufficient
work to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance with JORC Code 2012. It is possible that further
evaluation and/or exploration may reduce confidence in these results as further sampling is undertaken
to advance the project to JORC Code 2012 compliance. To date northing has come to the Company’s
attention that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability of the historic sampling but as the
Company has not independently validated these results it is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or
endorsing these results.
SHAREHOLDER VALUE
With the completion of the Treuer Range Project acquisition, NewPeak continues its rejuvenation plans.
The Northern Territory’s Ngalia Basin is one of Australia’s most promising basins for sandstone-hosted
Uranium and Vanadium resources and offers the Company a multi-target opportunity for the discovery
of a Uranium and Vanadium resource. Treuer Range compliments the Company’s Canadian Uranium
exploration projects and moves NewPeak forward in achieving its main objective of being a significant
explorer and ultimately holder of strategic critical mineral resources in prime world jurisdictions.

other parties on Uranium. This work delineated the Bigrlyi Deposit. Follow-
up exploration commenced in 2005 under Energy Metals Ltd.
• Other parts of the project area have been explored for Gold and
Gold-Copper (MIM Exploration 1992-95, BHP Minerals 1996-97,
Gutnick Resources NL 2004).
• A 1999 regional airborne magnetic-radiometric survey by Rio
Tinto Exploration identified a radiometric anomaly in EL33611
within Mount Eclipse Sandstones.
• Airborne geophysical surveying over parts of EL33611 by Alara
Resources Ltd 2006-13, Royal Resources Ltd 2010-16, Element

Geology • Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. • The project potentially hosts repetitions and extensions of the
Bigrlyi Deposit which consists of roll front style uranium-
vanadium mineralization that occurs in the basal stratigraphic
sequence of the Mount Eclipse Sandstone. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
