NewPeak Executes Treuer Range Uranium-Vanadium
Project SPA, Northern Territory
HIGHLIGHTS
‚Ä¢ NewPeak wishes to inform its shareholders and the market that it has executed a Sale and Purchase
Agreement and Royalty Agreement to acquire the Treuer Range Uranium-Vanadium Project in the
Northern Territory, Australia.
‚Ä¢ The consideration for the acquisition is $350,000 by way of the issue of 23,333,333 NPM shares at an
issue price of $0.015 (1.5 cents) per share, and the granting of a 2% net smelter royalty to the Vendor,
with buyout provisions favourable to NewPeak.
‚Ä¢ An initial payment of 6,666,667 NPM shares will be paid to the Vendor immediately, and the remainder
when the Permit EL 33611 has been transferred to NewPeak.
‚Ä¢ The Treuer Range Project is located in the Northern Territory‚Äôs Ngalia Basin. It surrounds the Bigrlyi
Uranium-Vanadium Deposit where a JORC Indicated and Inferred mineral resource of 7.5 MT grading
0.13% U O and 1.12% V O has been defined within the Mount Eclipse Sandstone. (The Bigrlyi Deposit
3 8 2 5
is held by other parties and is excluded from the Treuer Range project).
NewPeak Metals Ltd (ASX:NPM) (NewPeak or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has executed a
Sale and Purchase Agreement with Yacimiento Pty Ltd (Vendor) to acquire the Treuer Range Uranium-
Vanadium Project (Permit EL 33611) in the Northern Territory, Australia (Figure 1).
This acquisition marks the next significant step of the Company‚Äôs rejuvenation plans in entering the strategic
critical minerals space and provides NewPeak with a unique opportunity in an excellent jurisdiction that
complements the recent acquisition of its Canadian George River Uranium and Rare Earths Elements Project,
and its ongoing search for other critical mineral projects in prime jursidictions.
The Company is confident that the recent Finland, Sweden and New Zealand projects sales, the successful
$500,000 Placement and $529,811 Entitlement Issue capital raisings, and additional future assets sales
provide both immediate cash, as well as the receipt of staged cash payments and tradeable shares over the
near to medium term, to support both the Company‚Äôs exploration plans for these critical mineral properties
and its expansion plans.
NEWPEAK‚ÄôS FUTURE EXPLORATION PLANS
NewPeak intends to conduct exploration at the Treuer Range Project, with the objective of defining
JORC mineral resources. The exploration program would include:
‚Ä¢ A detailed review and evaluation of historic exploration including a reinterpretation of
geochemical, airborne, and ground geophysical and drill hole-derived data.
‚Ä¢ The acquisition and interpretation of ASTER or other high-definition satellite imagery.
‚Ä¢ Reconnaissance geochemical sampling (including portable XRF), scintillometer transverse
and broad-scale geological mapping. Geochemical samples will be submitted for multi-
element analyses, including a suite of indicator elements for Bigrlyi-style Uranium-
1

Vanadium.
‚Ä¢ Priority areas would be followed up with wide-spaced, low-detection soil sampling, and
areas with shallow cover tested by trenching, RAB and/or aircore drilling.
‚Ä¢ Ground geophysical surveys such as magnetics, radiometric, and IP, or even Sub-Audio
Magnetics (SAM), may be carried out over potential areas to better define geology and
mineralised zones.
‚Ä¢ RC drilling will test the mineral potential at priority areas, and to improve the geological
understanding.
‚Ä¢ Infill RC and diamond core drilling to define JORC Resources and obtain samples for
metallurgical test work.
The company expects this exploration program to begin in the second half of 2024, subject to
statutory approvals.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
NewPeak and the Company‚Äôs Competent Person recognize that these historic exploration results have not
been reported in accordance with JORC Code 2012 and a Competent Person has not done sufficient work
to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance with JORC Code 2012. It is possible that further
evaluation and/or exploration may reduce confidence in these results as further sampling is undertaken to
advance the project to JORC Code 2012 compliance. To date northing has come to the Company‚Äôs
attention that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability of the historic sampling but as the Company
has not independently validated these results it is not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing
these results.
SHAREHOLDER VALUE
With the completion of the Treuer Range Project acquisition, NewPeak continues its rejuvenation plans.
The Northern Territory‚Äôs Ngalia Basin is one of Australia‚Äôs most promising basins for sandstone-hosted
Uranium and Vanadium resources and offers the Company a multi-target opportunity for the discovery of
a Uranium and Vanadium resource. Treuer Range compliments the Company‚Äôs Canadian Uranium
exploration projects and moves NewPeak forward in achieving its main objective of being a significant
explorer and ultimately holder of strategic critical mineral resources in prime world jurisdictions.
