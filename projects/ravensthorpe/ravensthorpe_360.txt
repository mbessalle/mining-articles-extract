The Board of Bulletin Resources (ASX: BNR, Bulletin) provides the following Activities Report for the quarter ending 
30th June 2023.  
Ravensthorpe Lithium Project  
The 130km2 Ravensthorpe Lithium Project hosts high-grade spodumene and lepidolite bearing pegmatites and is 
located only 12km southwest and along strike of Allkem Limited’s (ASX:AKE) Mt Cattlin lithium mine.  
Work to advance the Project during the quarter included:  
• 
Mapping and sampling to the west of known pegmatites 
• 
Soil auger sampling of radiometric targets in newly acquired tenement E74/680 
• 
Progression of passive seismic R&D program with CSIRO  
• 
Liaison with regulatory bodies to progress drilling approvals 
Mapping confirms a third pegmatite trend to the west of known lithium pegmatites 
On-ground mapping and sampling work following the LIDAR and high-resolution imagery targeting program has 
confirmed a third pegmatite trend to the west of the Western Pegmatite trend. The new pegmatite trend is named 
West2. Pegmatites along this trend are thinner and less fractionated than those seen to the east and no lithium 
mineralisation has been noted to date, supporting the geological interpretation that the pegmatites fractionate 
from west to east (Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1:  Spodumene locations, LCT pegmatite locations and rock chip assays above 2.0% Li2O  
 
 
 
Radiometric target soil sampling program 
Re-interpolation and interpretation of radiometric imagery with a focus on pegmatites identified a large 2.5 km 
long potassium (K) anomaly within the newly acquired tenement, E74/680 (Figure 2). The radiometric anomaly is 
north along strike of the Eastern Pegmatite Trend which hosts known spodumene bearing pegmatites including 
Big Pegmatite and Deep Purple Pegmatite. 
 
Figure 2:  Radiometric imagery and targets over Bulletin’s Ravensthorpe Lithium Project 
An auger soil sampling program was completed over the radiometric target. Samples were collected on a 200m x 
50m grid pattern as an initial test for pegmatites using a handheld auger with a target sample depth of 0.8m. In 
areas of lesser regolith such as the northern line, samples were taken at refusal with a minimum depth of 0.2m.  
The area generally comprises fine, sticky clays with little evidence of a coarse component, except where saprolite 
was encountered. Saprolite consisted of mafic volcanics, gabbro and dolerite. No pegmatite was encountered. 
The geology of the northern line was somewhat different from those to the south and was dominated by shallow 
 
 
quartz float as seen by the lighter coloring in the aerial imagery. The area is farmed with the top 20cm of the soil 
profile disturbed by farming activity.  Topography is gently undulating with the lowest elevation area being a SW 
trending drainage pattern on the western side of the sampled area. 
Soil sampling has provided anomalous, up to 70 ppm lithium in soils. Elements indicative of pegmatite such as Rb 
Cs, Ta and Ga were also assessed to support evidence of pegmatite and these elements are generally of low 
abundance and show low correlation with lithium. The lack of supporting anomalism of other elements typically 
associated with pegmatite do not provide encouragement for lithium bearing pegmatites at depth.  
The lithium anomalism associated with the radiometric signature in this area is accordingly interpreted to be 
associated with alteration of ultramafics or volcanics rather than a pegmatite association.

Passive seismic geophysical program 
A research and development program with CSIRO is underway to determine if passive seismic geophysical 
techniques can be used to image pegmatites at depth in the Ravensthorpe area. The program aims to image the 
upper surface of the pegmatites and provide an indication of pegmatite geometry. The work, if successful, will be 
used to better understand structure and provide a vector for drilling. 
During the quarter, data collection was undertaken with 100 receivers placed over Deep Purple pegmatite. The 
receivers were left in ground for two weeks, during which time ambient noise generated by either natural 
processes such as ocean waves, wind and earthquakes, or by anthropogenic activities such as road or railway 
traffic and mining activity was collected. CSIRO is processing the data and a report of results is expected by year 
end. 
Drilling approvals  
Drilling of spodumene bearing pegmatites along the Eastern Pegmatite Trend is proposed. Drilling is within the 
Cocanarup Timber Reserve and consent to explore within the Timber Reserve was provided as part of tenement 
grant conditions. As reported in the December 2022 quarter, environmental surveys completed by independent 
consultants to Bulletin concluded the overall impact of clearing drill rig access tracks and exploration drilling will 
be minimal and not likely to result in significant impact on fauna habitat.   
Bulletin continues to maintain regular contact with regulatory authorities and awaits the outcome of the 
regulatory permitting process with plans to commence drilling as soon as possible.  
As in the previously reported quarter, the proposed drill program was referred to the Western Australian 
Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). The EPA has yet to make a decision on the significance of the effect on 
the environment of the proposal and whether or not to assess the proposal and, if the decision is to assess, the 
level of assessment. Bulletin has provided the EPA with additional avoidance and mitigation measures. Towards 
the end of the quarter, the EPA requested further information which Bulletin promptly provided. 
Bulletin also referred the program to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water 
(DCCEEW) to review these mitigation measures. DCCEEW has decided that further assessment is required into the

 Lake Rebecca Gold Project 
Lake Rebecca tenement E28/3077 lies approximately 10km east of the Ramelius Resource’s (ASX:RMS), formerly 
Breaker’s (ASX:BRB) Lake Roe 1.7Moz Au deposit (Figure 4).  
A first-pass soil sampling program was completed over the majority of the tenement, targeting magnetic highs 
interpreted to represent mafic and ultramafic lithologies. The tenement is almost exclusively covered by recent 
transported sediments of unknown thickness. 
The wide spaced (800m x 200m) ultrafine soil sampling program has identified a number of gold anomalies with 
co-incident copper, a common association of mineralisation in the Kurnalpi terrain (Figure 5).  Maximum soil 
values are 8ppb Au and 65ppm Cu. The soil anomalies extend for 1km - 3km in length with a north - northeast 
strike, indicating potential association with the region’s D5 late stage gold events. Infill soil sampling is planned.

Mt Clere 
The Mt Clere Rare Earth Project (E52/4136) comprises a 180km2 area along the Ti Tree Shear Zone in the Gascoyne 
Region.   
The Project is a conceptual target relying on its structural setting. The tenement lies along the south-westerly 
dipping Ti Tree Shear Zone which is a mantle tapping (deep) lineament. This is a particularly important feature as 
these deep mantle tapping faults can provide a pathway for intrusives such as carbonatites or mineralising fluids. 
Examples of rare earth mineralisation stemming from these deep faults are Hastings Mineral Technology Metals 
Limited’s (ASX:HAS) Yangibana Project, Dreadnought Resources’ (ASX:DRE) Yin carbonatites off the Lyons River 
Fault and Kingfisher Mining Limited’s (ASX:KFM) Mick Well Project which lies off the Chalba shear zone. 
Spodumene bearing pegmatites are also noted to the northwest along the Ti Tree shear zone at Delta Lithium 
Limited’s (ASX:DLI) Malinda lithium project (Figure 6).   
 
Figure 6:  Bulletin’s Mt Clere Project location map    
Bulletin’s Mt Clere project is predominantly covered by quaternary alluvium. To the east, sporadic outcrops are 
present and consist of dolomites, shales and siltstones and cherty ironstones.  
The tenement’s initial phase of exploration comprised reconnaissance mapping supported by soil sampling, 
stream sediment sampling and rock chip sampling. A total of 331 soil samples on a 400m x 100m spacing targeted 
three discrete magnetic highs associated with the Mt Clere Fault. Fourteen stream samples were collected from 
trap sites located in second-order and third-order intermittent water courses and 6 rock chip samples from varying 
lithologies were collected for petrological analysis. 
Soil sampling analysis varied according to ground sampling conditions. In the west, the two magnetic highs were 
sampled using ultrafine (UFF) collection and analysis methods as the area is obscured by alluvial of unknown 
thickness. The eastern soil sampling area is dominated by lag with very little fine sediment, so the UFF was 
 
 
considered an ineffective tool. Soils in this area were sieved to 2mm and analyzed via 4 acid digest followed by 
ICP-MS and ICP-AES. This method only reports the acid leachable portion of REE, and using a subset of 
complementary analysis method, results from this method were normalised against the UFF samples for analysis 
and reporting purposes. 
Soil sampling returned moderately elevated results with a maximum of 466 ppm TREO with up to 34% MREO 
content including 23% NdPr oxides*.  The western soils and streams results show weakly to moderately elevated 
REE anomalism. While anomalous, peaks of the soil results are not as high as those noted further west at the REE 
projects such as at Yangibana (soils typically 1000 - 2500ppm TREO). This may be either a function of different 
geological setting, thicker alluvial cover, a deeper mineralisation source or a lack of carbonatites (at depth).  
Stream sediment sampling returned a best result of 391 ppm TREO with 26% MREO content including 21% NdPr 
oxides. The streams drain from an area of subdued NE trending magnetics in the central area of the tenement. 
These better stream sediment results contain higher TREO than stream sediments downstream of soil sampling 
over the magnetic high areas, suggesting better prospectivity may be present in the untested target area 
associated with NE magnetic trends highlighted in Figure 7.  The NE trending magnetics are discordant to the 
regional geology and may represent dykes, a potential host to REE. 
Occasional outcrops occur in the eastern portion of the tenement while the western half is completely under 
alluvial cover. Rock chips were taken over the limited outcrop for petrological purposes. The highest rock chip 
grade, assaying 144ppm TREO derived from a cherty ironstone unit in the southeast of the tenement. The cherty 
ironstone strikes broadly east-west and is congruent to local stratigraphy (Figure 8).  
* TREO = Total Rare Earth Oxides, MREO = Magnetic Rare Earth Oxides, NdPr Oxides = Neodymium + 
Praseodymium Oxides (Neodymium and Praseodymium are higher value magnetic rare earth oxides)

trending magnetics that are discordant to the regional geology and possibly representing dykes

Mt Farmer Project 
The Mt Farmer Project is located in the Dalgaranga area, 80km NW of Mt Magnet in an area historically known 
for gold and tantalum. The Mt Farmer project surrounds Aldoro Resources Ltd’s (“Aldoro”, ASX:ARN,) Niobe 
Rubidium-Lithium Project hosting a resource of 4.6Mt @ 0.17% Rb2O and 0.07% Li2O. It is also adjacent to Krakatoa 
Resources Limited’s (“Krakatoa”, ASX:KTA) King Tamba Rubidium resource of 5Mt @ 0.14%Rb2O and 0.05% Li2O 
as well as their more recent discovery of lithium bearing rock chips up to 4.3% Li2O, 1.7% Rb2O and 0.5% Cs2O at 
their Wilsons prospect (Figure 1).  The Mt Farmer project also has potential northeast extensions to the

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, 
random chips, or specific specialised industry 
standard measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as down hole 
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, 
etc.). These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
Soil samples taken according to ultrafine sampling protocol as provided by 
CSIRO. Samples ~200gm, sieved to 2mm sample taken from ~10-15 cm below 
surface.  
 
Auger soils taken to refusal depth, typically 0.2 – 0.8m. 
 
Soils located with GPS with ~3m accuracy. 
 
 
 
• Measures taken to ensure sample representivity 
and 
the 
appropriate 
calibration 
of 
any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation 
that are Material to the Public Report. In cases 
where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this 
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation 
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from 
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as where there 
is coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation 
types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole 
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, 
etc.) and details (eg core diameter, triple or 
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is 
oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
No drilling reported. 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip 
sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery 
and ensure representative nature of the 
samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain 
of fine/coarse material. 
No drilling reported. 
 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level 
of detail to support appropriate Mineral 
Resource estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in 
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) 
photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged. 
All samples were logged for regolith lithology, rock type, oxidation, veining, 
alteration and mineralisation.  
 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary 
split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry. 
• 
For all sample types, the nature, quality and 
appropriateness of the sample preparation 
technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples 
• 
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is 
representative of the in situ material collected, 
including 
for 
instance 
results 
for 
field 
 No drilling. 
 
 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
duplicate/second-half sampling 
• 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the 
grain size of the material being sampled. 
Quality of 
assay data 
and 
laboratory 
tests 
• 
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the 
assaying and laboratory procedures used and 
whether the technique is considered partial or 
total. 
• 
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld 
XRF instruments, etc., the parameters used in 
determining the analysis including instrument 
make and model, reading times, calibrations 
factors applied and their derivation, etc. 
• 
Nature of quality control procedures adopted 
(eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable 
levels of accuracy (ie. lack of bias) and precision 
have been established. 
Soil ultrafine assaying completed by Labwest. The lab has the commercial rights 
to conduct analysis.  
 
UltraFine+ processing includes a Spectro-Analytical RS3500 UV-VIS-NIR 
spectrometer with bifurcated fibre-optic probe for clay mineralogy, Malvern 
Mastersizer 2000 with liquid and dry-powder introduction capabilities, Pro-
Analytical centrifuges and Milestone Ethos-UP microwave digestion apparatus. 
Analysis is by Perkin-Elmer Nexion-series ICP-MS.  
 
Soils not subject to ultrafine were assayed via ME-MS61r ALS methodology; 
Ultra-Trace Four-Acid Digestion with ICP MS and ICP-AES. 
 
Auger soils assayed by completed by commercial laboratory in Perth and 
analysis methods appropriate to lithium pegmatite investigation via sodium 
peroxide fusion. 
 
 
Verification 
of sampling 
and assaying 
• 
The verification of significant intersections by 
either independent or alternative company 
personnel. 
• 
The use of twinned holes. 
• 
Documentation of primary data, data entry 
procedures, data verification, data storage 
(physical and electronic) protocols. 
• 
Discuss any adjustment to assay data. 
Soils - Raw assay data was subjected to statistical analysis. Percentiles were 
generated for each analyte which were used to classify anomalous zones. 
 
Soils analysed by ME-MS61r method were normalised to soils assayed by UFF 
using a set of samples analysed by both methods as a basis. 
 
No other adjustments made to assay data. 
 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Location of 
data points 
• 
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate 
drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), 
trenches, mine workings and other locations 
used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
• 
Specification of the grid system used. 
• 
Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
Data points were located with hand-held GPS. 
 
Data spacing 
and 
distribution 
• 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
Whether the data spacing and distribution is 
sufficient to establish the degree of geological 
and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral 
Resource 
and 
Ore 
Reserve 
estimation 
procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
• 
Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
Soils - Sampling comprised line spacing of various intervals, typically 100 – 400 
in spacing. 
Data is insufficient to establish resources/reserves. 
No sample compositing. 
 
 
Orientation of 
data in 
relation to 
geological 
structure 
• 
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves 
unbiased sampling of possible structures and the 
extent to which this is known, considering the 
deposit type. 
• 
If 
the relationship 
between the 
drilling 
orientation 
and 
the 
orientation 
of 
key 
mineralised structures is considered to have 
introduced a sampling bias, this should be 
assessed and reported if material. 
Soils - the structural relationship to gold is unknown at this time. Any bias as a 
result of the sampling is unknown. 
 
Sample 
security 
• 
The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
Samples were handled by BNR staff and delivered directly to the laboratory. 
Audits or 
reviews 
• 
The results of any audits or reviews of sampling 
techniques and data. 
No audit has been carried out.

• The security of the tenure held at the time of 
reporting along with any known impediments 
to obtaining a license to operate in the area. 
Refer to tenement list in report.  
Exploration 
done by other 
parties 
• Acknowledgment 
and 
appraisal 
of 
exploration by other parties. 
Work in the broader Lake Rebecca area has been carried out by Placer Ltd, 
Aberfoyle Ltd and Newcrest.  Minimal past exploration has been carried out at 
Chifley, Mt Farmer and Mt Clere. Previous workers at Ravensthorpe include 
Lithium Australia, Galaxy who reported pegmatites in the area. 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of 
mineralisation. 
The deposit types being sought are orogenic syntectonic gold mineralisation, LCT 
pegmatites, and REE associated with carbonatites. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following 
information for all material drill holes: 
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation 
above sea level in metres) of the drill hole 
collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o down hole length and interception depth 
o hole length. 
• If the exclusion of this information is justified 
on the basis that the information is not 
No drilling reported.

JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
material and this exclusion does not detract 
from the understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain why 
this is the case. 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (eg. cutting of 
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
material and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and longer 
lengths of low grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should be stated 
and 
some 
typical 
examples 
of 
such 
aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
No data was cut. Soil assay data was analysed on a percentile basis to determine 
anomalies. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important 
in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole 
length, true width not known’). 
No relationship between soil results and geometry is assumed. 
 
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
A plan summarising salient aspects of exploration has been included in text. 
 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high 
grades and/or widths should be practiced to 
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
A summary of results is included in the report. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but 
not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test 
results; 
bulk 
density, 
groundwater, 
geotechnical 
and 
rock 
characteristics; 
potential 
deleterious 
or 
contaminating 
substances. 
A review made use of publicly available material including aeromagnetics, 
surface sampling and drilling by previous explorers.   
Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work 
(eg tests for lateral extensions or depth 
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of 
possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling 
areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive. 
Soil sampling, drilling and other exploration works are planned to progress 
exploration in the tenements.
