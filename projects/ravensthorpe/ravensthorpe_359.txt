Critical metals explorer, DMC Mining Limited (ASX: DMM) (DMC or the Company) is pleased to provide 
its December 2023 quarterly report. 
During the quarter, the Company announced results from the initial reconnaissance field program at 
Talon Ridge, with a >2.5x Li anomaly to background on the northern sample line. 
Post quarter end, the Company placed its shares into voluntary suspension pending the announcement 
of a material project acquisition and associated capital raising. The shares are expected to remain 
suspended until the completion of the transaction. 
 
Yilgarn Craton and Albany Fraser Orogen 
Exploration continued during the quarter at the Company’s Talon Ridge Lithium Project, located east of 
Kalgoorlie-Boulder.  
Soil sampling was completed at the project, with anomalous results of a >2.5x background received on the 
northern line of samples. The program was an orientation program, with seven lines of samples collected 
and submitted for ionic leach analysis at ALS Geochemistry. 
The ionic leach samples have been reviewed and their anomaly to background ratio for Li, Rb, Ta, Cs, and  
Nb  calculated.  Sample lines to  the  north  do  show  over 1.5 to 2.8x  anomaly  ratio  for  Li  with

corresponding  elevated  Ta  sample (see Figure 1). While the anomaly ratios have been developed against 
a population background, the anomaly magnitudes are low when considered in the context of ‘immediate 
targets for follow-up work’.  
The benefit is that the anomalies identified to date do suggest the sampling medium and analytical 
process is suited to Talon Ridge area. The sample spacing on the orientation lines are 300m apart and 
zones where anomalies were identified for Li, Ta, Cs, Rb, and Nb will be considered for in-fill sampling to 
confirm the anomaly, develop a sense of orientation, and attempt to increase anomaly magnitude. Figure 
1 shows the Li anomaly to background ratio for the orientation lines.

During the quarter, mapping and sampling identified a number of outcropping pegmatites, however 
sampling of these did not produce anomalous results. 
 
Ravensthorpe Nickel Project 
Flora and Fauna surveys required by DMIRS in preparation for drilling have been completed. 
No field work was undertaken during the quarter.
