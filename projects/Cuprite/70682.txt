# Cuprite LLC Acquires Ground Adjacent and Internal to StrikePoint Gold's Cuprite Gold Project, Walker Lane, Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 9, 2024) - StrikePoint Gold Inc. (TSXV: SKP) (OTCQB: STKXF) ("StrikePoint" or the "Company") is pleased to provide an update the wholly owned Cuprite Gold Project.

Cuprite LLC acquired by staking approximately 152 claims immediately to the West of the Company's Cuprite Gold Project. This claim block ties onto the Company's land package. 

StrikePoint believes that Cuprite LLC is controlled by the Electrum Group a New York-based registered investment adviser. Electrum makes strategic investments principally in high-quality precious metals assets and opportunities and manages Client assets on a discretionary basis, valued at [~$1.7 Billion as of December 31, 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PL0xJHLnKk). Further information about the Electrum Group can be found [here](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wWQYJTy51M).

In addition, the Company has recently become aware that that a third party, potentially associated with the Electrum Group, has leased the 54 claims that are internal to the Cuprite Gold Project. 

"The recent activity validates our excitement about the Cuprite Gold Project" said CEO Michael G. Allen. "Our drill results show that the Cuprite Project hosts a large-scale mineralized system, and others are moving into this emerging gold district in Nevada where StrikePoint has a strong land position."

StrikePoint Golds inaugural drill program at Cuprite project was the first drilling on the project since staking was allowed on the property. This inaugural drill program cut gold mineralization in four of five holes.

_**Lithogeochemistry and Clay Alteration Studies**_

The Company recently completed detailed lithogeochemical and preliminary clay alteration studies on reverse circulation chips from our recent drill campaign. The detailed analysis confirmed the presence of a series of East-West structures forming a down dropped graben, as well as other northeast trending structures. The clay alteration suggests that these structures have become conduits for mineralizing fluids. The Company is in the process of reviewing all data prior to the next phase of drilling.
