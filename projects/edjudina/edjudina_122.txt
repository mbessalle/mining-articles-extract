Introduction 
 
Gibb River Diamonds Limited (‘GIB’ or the ‘Company’) is pleased to announce the 
acquisition of granted Mining Licence M31/481. This lease is the missing link in GIB’s 
Edjudina Gold Project and is contiguous with GIB’s Mining Licence MLA31/495 (in 
application) which hosts the Neta JORC (2012) gold resource of 24,000 ounces @ 1.9 g/t 
Indicated & Inferred5.

The Company believes M31/481 is highly prospective for Neta-style gold deposits, the 
northern boundary of M31/481 is only 60 metres (on-strike) from GIB’s Neta resource. This 
acquisition opens up new and highly prospective areas for exploration and discovery. 
 
There are extensive workings on M31/481 which date back to 1897 and which mainly follow 
the line of strike from GIB’s Neta Prospect. Significant historic mines located on M31/481 
include Neta Junction, Geneve, Robertson and Senate; the original Senate mineshaft was 
91 metres deep.

Acquisition Terms 
 
The Lease has been purchased 100% from Hawthorn Resources Limited (ASX: HAW). 
There are no private royalties on the tenement. The following fee has been paid for the 
acquisition: 
 1.5 million GIB shares escrowed for 12 months for the purchase of tenement 
M31/481, and; 
 1.5 million GIB shares escrowed for 12 months for the existing mining information 
and data. 
 
For a total of 3 million GIB shares escrowed for 12 months. There is no cash component.  
 
Completion will occur when the original tenement Transfer Document (Form 23) has been 
counter-signed and returned to GIB (currently in mail transit) and GIB has issued the 
acquisition shares to HAW. 
 
The Company considers the terms of this acquisition as competitive and fair. GIB welcomes 
Hawthorn Resources Limited to the GIB share register and thanks them for this opportunity 
to add value to GIB shares.

Historical Gold Production at Edjudina, including newly acquired M31/481 
 
The historical production reported below covers the period 1898 to 1921, only limited 
production appears to have been achieved post 1921 and this is poorly documented. Of 
particular note is the exceptional grade of the historical production at 41.0 g/t Au.  
 
There are hundreds of small, shallow prospecting and production pits dotted along the 
Edjudina Line. The majority of the deeper workings stop at the water table (approximately 
34m).  
 
The bulk of the historic production at Edjudina comes from the Paget area, which includes 
all of the areas from the current GIB owned historic Neta Mine running southeast to the 
Gawler Mine (Figure 1). The main production shafts in the Paget area are Neta (122m deep), 
Geneve (34m deep); Senate (91m deep) and Gawler (122m deep). Of these, Senate is on 
the newly acquired M31/481.

A Due to the underground nature of the workings in the Paget area, it is unclear what 
production is attributable to which mine. This production data is from statistics obtained from 
the List of Cancelled Gold Mining Leases; WA Mines Department; 19542&3. 
 
B The Edjudina South area production figures include the Edjudina Line of workings from 
Perseverance running south east to Glengarry (Figure 1). All of this area is included in the 
GIB optioned ground. This data is from WAMEX report A238084

Previous Exploration and Mining at Edjudina: including M31/481 
 
The main period of mining activity on the Edjudina Gold Project occurred between 1897 and 
1921. 
 
The Government Geologist Andrew Gibb Maitland made the first documented description of 
the Edjudina Line in 1903 and this was followed up by reports in 1903 and 1905 by the State 
Government Mining Engineer, Alexander Montgomery. These reports described a number 
of private batteries being run at Edjudina at this time, with some ore also carted to the nearby 
State Battery at Yarri.  
 
A minor revival in mining took place from 1936-1939, which was curtailed by the start of 
World War 2. 
 
In 1974-75 Australian Anglo American Ltd explored Edjudina, followed by United Nickel 
Exploration, Cambrian Exploration and Penzoil of Australia Ltd (1979-81). 
 
In 1993 Pancontinental picked up much of the ground and conducted drilling operations, 
relinquishing the ground in 1995. Little exploration work was conducted over the next 14 
years with the exception of Gutnick Resources who are reported as having completed some 
wide spaced drilling during this time, however a complete dataset for this work is still being 
sourced. 
 
GIB acquired the Edjudina Gold Project in July 2020 and made the Neta Discovery in 
October 2020 with the discovery hole returning 36 metres at 4.0 g/t Au from 4 metres.

Lookahead 
 
GIB is currently following-up on the historic exploration data from the extensive and valuable 
database acquired from Hawthorn Resources Limited as part of this transaction. The 
Company is generating new exploration targets from this data with a view to drilling the best 
targets. Further updates will follow.

Conclusion 
 
The Board of GIB is excited to have acquired Mining Lease M31/481. This lease fills in the 
gap between the historic Neta and Gawler mines and provides some excellent ground for 
the targeting and discovery of Neta-style gold deposits, the type-deposit of which lies only 
60 metres north of the M31/481 boundary. 
 
The extensive historic workings and historic mines on M31/481 further add to the 
prospectivity of the acquisition.  
 
The Company considers the terms of this acquisition as competitive and fair. GIB welcomes 
Hawthorn Resources Limited to the GIB share register and thanks them for this opportunity 
to add value to GIB shares.

On a separate note to the acquisition, the Company continues to progress the grant of the 
mining lease application over the Neta Prospect at Edjudina and GIB is optimistic the mining 
licence will be granted in an expeditious manner.
