Vancouver, British Columbia - May 6, 2024 - TheNewswire: Gold Basin Resources Corporation (the "Company", "Gold Basin" or the "Optionee") – (TSX-V GXX, OTCQB: GXXFF) today announced the signing of a property option agreement made as of May 3, 2024 (the "Agreement" or the "Option Agreement") with Iconic Minerals Ltd. (TSXV:ICM; OTCQB: ICMFF) ("Iconic") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconic (together with Iconic, the "Vendors"), whereby []()Gold Basin can acquire from the Vendors a 50% interest in and to the New Pass gold property ("New Pass" or the "Property") consisting of 107 unpatented mineral claims (2,140 hectares) located three hours east of Reno, just off Highway US-50E in Churchill County, Nevada. 

 

Highlights

 

  * New Pass hosts the Carlin-type New Pass Gold-Silver ("Au-Ag") deposit, with a historical (2010) NI 43-101 Inferred Mineral Resource of 341,750 ounces ("oz") of gold equivalent ("AuEq"), and separate estimates of gold-only ("Au") and silver-only ("Ag") of 282,986 oz Au and 3,134,129 oz Ag; 


 
  * The NI 43-101 report includes a "Potential Exploration Target" (the "Target") of 12 to 17 million short tons (~11 to 16 metric tonnes) at potential grades of 0.015 to 0.025 ounces per short ton ("opt") AuEq (~0.51 to 0.86 grams per metric tonne "g/t" AuEq) which could contain 180,000 to 425,000 oz AuEq; 


 
  * Mineralization comes to surface with 75% of the deposit estimated to be oxidized, amenable to heap leaching from previous metallurgical testwork; 


 
  * Mineralization is open in all directions, providing an excellent opportunity for resource expansion and conversion; 


 
  * Highlight historical drill hole intercepts include: 

    * 51.82 meters ("") @ 3.67 g/t Au from 24.38 m (hole NP-92-1) 

    * 32.00 m @ 3.94 g/t Au from 22.86 m (hole NP-28) 

    * 42.67 m @ 1.98 g/t Au from 109.73 m (hole NP-54) 

    * 47.24 m @ 1.95 g/t Au from 7.62 m (hole NP-88-24); 


 
  * New Pass has an active Plan of Operations, permitting up to 25 acres of exploration-associated allowable disturbance; and 


 
  * New Pass is located in Nevada’s prolific multi-million-ounce Sulfur-Lovestock-Austin structural gold trend, and is only 75 kilometres ("km") south-southwest of the past-producing McCoy-Cove Mine (produced 3.3 Moz Au and over 100 Moz of Ag). McCoy-Cove is poised to resume production with i-80 Gold Corp. 


 

Colin Smith, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, "Gold Basin has substantially increased its endowment of bulk mineable, near-surface, heap leachable oxide gold with the acquisition of New Pass. This Carlin-type gold system remains open in all directions, and is located within the core of one of Nevada’s fertile gold trends, proximal to strategic development infrastructure. We greatly anticipate getting boots-on-the-ground and rapidly advancing this asset in conjunction with the Gold Basin Project, leveraging our technical team’s extensive experience exploring oxide gold systems in the SW USA."

 

New Pass Property

New Pass is located within the Basin and Range province, along Nevada’s prolific Sulfur-Lovestock-Austin structural gold trend (Figures 1 and 2). The Property was first explored in 1980, when a stream sediment arsenic anomaly led to the discovery of a gold-bearing jasperoid. Since then, over 40,000 m in 329 holes have been drilled, many of which intercepted significant intervals of Carlin-type Au-Ag mineralization, establishing what is known as the New Pass Au-Ag deposit (Figures 3 and Figure 4).

 

The New Pass Au-Ag deposit represents a classic Carlin-type system, with mineralization largely contained within silicified host rocks and jasperoid which developed in decalcified limestone of the Triassic Lower Augusta Mountain Formation. A major north-northwest – south-southeast trending, west-dipping structure separates Triassic calcareous rocks from younger Tertiary volcanic rocks, and served as a major conduit for hydrothermal circulation, alteration, and gold-silver precipitation.

 

The deposit outcrops at surface, and has been drilled approximately 1.25 km along strike, with the deepest pierce point at a vertical depth of approximately 295 m. The tabular deposit has a shallow (~30°) dip to the west and remains open along strike in both directions, and at depth, offering an excellent opportunity for further exploration.

Historical NI 43-101 New Pass Mineral Resource Estimate

A revised technical report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report and Revised Resource Estimation on the New Pass Property, Churchill County, Nevada" dated September 3, 2010 (the "Report") was prepared for Iconic (then called Bonaventure Enterprises Inc.) and an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (the "Historical Resource") was completed on New Pass, authored by independent consulting geologist Paul Noland (Report available on www.sedarplus.ca). The Historical Resource totals 341,750 oz AuEq at a grade of 0.022 opt AuEq (~0.69 grams per metric tonne "g/t" AuEq) in 15,515,488 short tons (14,075,414 metric tonnes). The Resource also includes separate estimates of Au-only and Ag-only from the Historical Resource volume of 282,986 oz Au and 3,134,129 oz Ag. Note: AuEq equals gold in ounces per short ton (opt) plus silver (opt) valued at a 60:1 Au:Ag ratio, as defined in the Report.

The Report also includes a "Potential Exploration Target" of 12 to 17 million short tons (~11 to 16 metric tonnes) at potential grades of 0.015 to 0.025 opt AuEq (~0.51-0.86 g/t Au). The Potential Exploration Target does not extend beyond the limits of the existing drill holes and ignores possible strike extensions of the Historical Resource. Using these figures, the Potential Exploration Target could contain 180,000 to 425,000 ounces of AuEq (Table 2).

 

The drilling database used to calculate the Historical Resource included 266 holes totalling 30,546 meters, with 236 of the 266 holes containing sufficient mineral intercepts (≥0.01 opt AuEq) to be included in the Historical Resource calculation (Figures 3 and 4).

 

Table 1: Historical NI 43-101 Inferred Mineral Resource (Noland, 2010)

 

INFERRED |  AuEq |  AuEq |  Au |  Au |  Ag |  Ag  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
short tons |  opt |  oz |  opt |  oz |  opt |  oz  
15,515,488 |  0.022 |  341,750 |  0.018 |  282,986 |  0.202 |  3,134,129  
  |   |   |   |   |   |    
  
  1. The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared in accordance with the CIM Standards, and the CIM Guidelines, using geostatistical, plus economic and mining parameters appropriate to the deposit. 

  2. This estimate is considered to be a "historical estimate" under National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 

  3. Gold Equivalent ("AuEq") is derived from gold value in ounces per ton (opt) combined with the silver value in opt at a 60:1 Au:Ag ratio. 

  4. The cutoff grade used was 0.01 AuEq opt (equivalent gold expressed in troy ounces per short ton). 

  5. The isolated intercepts of 5 feet with cutoff grades above 0.01 AuEq opt were ignored unless the combined weighted average grade of that interval and any two adjacent intervals was greater than 0.01 AuEq opt. 

  6. Where data was missing for alternating intervals that were assayed, the missing data reflects the values of the lower of the two adjacent values. Where multiple adjacent intervals are missing data, each missing interval was assigned a zero value. 

  7. The Historical Resource was reported with an effective date September 3, 2010.  The qualified person for the Historical Resource was Paul D. Noland, CPG. 


 

Table 2: Historical NI 43-101 Potential Exploration Target (Noland, 2010)

 

POTENTIAL EXPLORATION TARGET |  AuEq |  AuEq |   |    
---|---|---|---|---  
short tons |  opt |  oz |   |    
12,000,000 - 17,000,000 |  0.015 - 0.025 |  180,000 - 425,000 |   |    
  |   |   |   |   |   |    
  
  1. Consists of the area between the two main inferred resource outlines plus down-dip extensions to the most westerly drill holes and up-dip extensions to the surface. Even though the Inferred Resource remains open-ended, the Potential Exploration Target was not extended beyond the limits of drilling along strike. 

  2. After determining the surface area of the Target, the average thickness and grade of the Inferred Resource was noted and bracketed as 60 to 70 feet with a potential grade of 0.015 to 0.025 opt AuEq, and a bracketed tonnage of 12 to 17 million short tons. 

  3. The Target’s quantity and grade described is conceptual. There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource. 


 

A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the Historical Resource as current, and the Company is not treating the Historical Resource as current mineral resources.

Metallurgical Testwork (McClelland Laboratories Inc.)

In 1988, Westmont Gold submitted 6 drill hole composite samples to McClelland Labs in Sparks, Nevada, for preliminary bottle roll and shake metallurgical testwork. Samples submitted included oxidized, reduced and mixed mineralization types. The oxidized samples demonstrated leach recoveries of gold between 75% and 77%.

Cautionary Note to United States Investors

Gold Basin prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws.  Terms relating to mineral resources in this news release are defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in CIM Standards.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted amendments effective February 25, 2019 (the "SEC Modernization Rules") to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC will now recognize estimates of "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral resources", which are defined in substantially similar terms to the corresponding CIM Standards.  In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of "proven mineral reserves" and "probable mineral reserves" to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Standards. 

U.S. investors are cautioned that while the foregoing terms are "substantially similar" to corresponding definitions under the CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Standards.  Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that Gold Basin may report as "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral resources" under NI 43-101 would be the same had Gold Basin prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.

In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of "inferred mineral resources" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43‑101.
