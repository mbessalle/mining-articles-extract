BRIGHTSTAR COMPLETES MONTAGUE EAST ACQUISITION 
WITH BTR GROUP MINERAL RESOURCES NOW 2.0MOZ AU 
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• 
Brightstar has completed the acquisition of the Montague East Gold Project (MEGP) from 
Gateway Mining Limited  
• 
The completion of the acquisition of the mineral resources at the MEGP signifies the 
strategic addition of shallow, advanced ounces to Brightstar which is aligned with the 
Company’s strategy of advancing multi assets towards near term commercialisation 
• 
The MEGP is located 70km from the Sandstone Gold Project, which is owned by Alto 
Metals Ltd, which is currently undertaking a merger with Brightstar by way of a Scheme 
of Arrangement  
• 
$5 million cash consideration paid and 466.67 million Brightstar shares issued to Gateway 
• 
Deferred contingent consideration of $2 million in Brightstar shares subject to further 
project milestones, including: 
o 
upon the commencement of commercial mining operations in respect of the gold 
mineral rights at MEGP, or  
o 
the delineation of a JORC Mineral Resource Estimate on the tenements exceeding 
1.0 Moz Au. 
• 
Following completion, the sale by Gateway of the consideration shares will be subject to 
orderly sales restrictions in consultation with Brightstar 
• 
Brightstar is planning a drilling program to commence at the MEGP in late October, 
targeting infill and extensional targets within and proximal to the Mineral Resources 
located at the advanced Whistler and Montague-Boulder deposits  
• 
Completion of the MEGP acquisition adds a further 9.6Mt @ 1.6g/t Au for 0.5Moz Au to 
Brightstar’s JORC Mineral Resource Estimate  
• 
Total mineral endowment owned by Brightstar now 38.3Mt @ 1.6g/t Au for 2.0Moz Au 
 
Brightstar Resources Limited (ASX: BTR) (Brightstar) is pleased to announce the completion of the 
acquisition of the gold rights at the Montague East Gold project (MEGP) from Gateway Mining Limited (ASX: 
GML) (Gateway). 
For further details regarding the Transaction please refer to the Company’s ASX announcement released on 
1 August 20241.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Brightstar’s Managing Director, Alex Rovira, commented “The completion of the acquisition of the Montague 
East Gold Project from Gateway achieves the first step in Brightstar’s previously announced consolidation plan of 
the Sandstone district, adding shallow ounces and a meaningful Mineral Resource inventory to our portfolio of 
advanced exploration, development and producing gold assets in Western Australia.  
We are working towards mobilising an RC drill rig to the Montague-Boulder and Whistler deposits in late October, 
which contain ~280koz Au of shallow, largely oxide material. It is our intent to move the Montague East Gold Project 
swiftly through resource drill-out and feasibility study workstreams to advance this asset towards development.  
With 2Moz of gold Mineral Resources situated on granted mining leases in the Company, combined with our low 
capex growth plans and near-term development and production expansion, Brightstar is well placed to maximise 
value of the portfolio in an all-time high gold price environment.  
Recent drilling success across the Lord Byron, Fish and Second Fortune deposits has illustrated the immense upside 
in the Company’s projects, as we seek to grow the Mineral Resource and de-risk future development through the 
DFS underway.” 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
MONTAGUE ACQUISITION 
Brightstar, via its wholly-owned subsidiary Montague Gold Project Pty Ltd (MGP), has acquired the interests 
held by Gateway and its wholly owned subsidiary Gateway Projects Pty Ltd (GPWA) in certain mining 
tenements in respect of Gateway’s Montague Gold Project, with Brightstar obtaining 100% of the gold 
mineral rights and Gateway retaining all other mineral rights.  
The total consideration paid by Brightstar in respect of the Montague acquisition is $14.0m, comprising:  
• 
an upfront cash payment of $5.0m; 
• 
466,666,667 Brightstar shares issued at an implied issue price of $0.015 per share for $7 million worth 
of fully paid Brightstar shares (Gateway Consideration Shares); and 
• 
$2.0m payable in cash or Brightstar shares, upon the commencement of commercial mining 
operations in respect of the gold mineral rights, or the delineation of a JORC Mineral Resource on the 
tenements exceeding 1.0 Moz Au. 
Following Completion, the sale by Gateway of the Gateway Consideration Shares will be subject to orderly 
sales restrictions in consultation with Brightstar.

ABOUT BRIGHTSTAR RESOURCES  
Brightstar Resources Limited is a Perth-
based gold development company listed 
on the Australian Securities Exchange 
(ASX: BTR).  
The Company hosts a portfolio of high 
quality assets hosted in the prolific 
Goldfields region of Western Australia, 
which are ideally located proximal to 
significant regional infrastructure and 
suppliers. 
The company currently operates the 
underground Second Fortune Gold Mine 
and recently completed the Selkirk 
Mining JV at Menzies pouring first gold in 
March 2024.  
In August 2024, Brightstar announced the 
consolidation of the Sandstone district with the integration of the Montague East Gold Project into Brightstar 
resulting in a combined JORC Mineral Resource of 38Mt @ 1.6g/t Au for 2.0Moz Au.  
Concurrently with this transaction, Brightstar’s planned merger with Alto Metals Ltd will deliver significant 
additional gold resources across three geographically separate hubs, providing excellent optionality for a 
staged development of all assets to build to a meaningful ASX-listed gold producer.
