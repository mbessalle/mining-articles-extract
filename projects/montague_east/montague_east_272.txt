Gateway’s Managing Director, Mr Mark Cossom, said: “We are delighted to have finalised this agreement with
Brightstar Resources, in the process crystallising significant value from our resource-level gold assets within
the Eastern Montague Project. The deal is structured in a way that delivers immediate cash into our balance
sheet while at the same time giving Gateway a seat at the table of an exciting potential emerging consolidation
play in the Sandstone region through a significant shareholding in Brightstar.
“Alex Rovira and his team at Brightstar are working hard to build a significant new gold production company
with an exciting growth future, and we are pleased to have been able to participate in what we believe amounts
to sensible rationalisation in the belt.

“By divesting our more advanced assets, Gateway has been able to create a significant liquidity event while
retaining all other mineral rights in the Eastern Tenement Group and gold and other mineral rights in the Western
Tenement Group. This means that our shareholders retain exposure to the exciting, value-creating exploration
opportunities that present across the broader tenement group – including the emerging magmatic nickel-copper
sulphide discovery opportunity we have reported recently.
“At the same time, we are able to strengthen our balance sheet in a non-dilutive way, putting us in an
unparalleled position in the current challenging equity market for the junior resource sector.
“This will enable us both to progress our own exploration opportunities and to evaluate and take advantage of
new and exciting growth and business development possibilities that are consistent with our skills-sets and
strategy. We also look forward to supporting Brightstar in their growth journey.”

Proceeds from the Transaction
Following completion of the Transaction, the Company will retain legal and beneficial ownership of all Other
Mineral Rights3 within the Sale Tenements (Montague East) and will retain legal and beneficial interest in the
tenements (and all mineral rights) which make up Montague West.
The Company’s immediate focus will be to continue systematic copper-nickel-PGE exploration at its Flametree
and Montague Range targets, including air-core drilling, reverse circulation (RC) drilling and diamond drilling
programs. In addition, Gateway will continue to progress early-stage exploration at several exciting new gold
targets on the Montague West group of tenements.

Flametree – An Emerging Cu-Ni-PGE Opportunity
• Flametree is an emerging mafic-ultramafic intrusive-hosted copper-nickel-PGE target identified through
a review of exploration undertaken in the area by Gateway in 2013/2014.
3 Exclude lithium rights within the Sale Tenements that subject to the farm-in joint venture agreement (PLC Farm-In) with Premier 1 Lithium
Limited (ASX:PLC) (PLC), whereby PLC has the right to acquire an 80% interest in the lithium rights (and related by-products). See
announcement dated 23 January 2023 for further details relating to the PLC Farm-In.

• Previous interpretation of the extensive oxide-zone copper occurrences at Flametree centred on a VHMS-
style mineralised system. However, one hole drilled into the unoxidized target area (GRC283) intersected
an ultramafic unit and associated copper-nickel-PGE mineralisation within massive sulphides, with
assays returning a significant intersection of 4m @ 1.03% Cu, 0.44% Ni, 0.9g/t Pt+ Pd, 426ppm Co
from 137m4.
• A subsequent series of ground EM surveys, including a fixed-loop time domain survey (FLTEM)
highlighted a significant EM anomaly at depth in the vicinity of this intersection.
• A recent reinterpretation of the regional geology based on a two-dimensional seismic survey suggested
that the regional dip of the stratigraphy is to the east, and that historic follow-up drilling of GRC283 and
targeting the FLTEM anomaly had subsequently been drilled in the wrong location.
• In December 2023, Gateway drilled an RC hole GRC1014 to confirm the easterly dip of the stratigraphy
and mineralisation, and returned sulphide mineralisation within an intrusive mafic-ultramafic package,
with significant Cu-Ni-PGE intersections of 1m @ 0.72% Cu, 0.41% Ni, 1.0g/t Pt+Pd, 840ppm Co from
195m and 1m @ 1.00% Cu, 0.39% Ni, 1.2g/t Pt+Pd, 756ppm Co from 209m (EOH)5.

ultramafic intrusive target.
Recent Diamond Drilling by Gateway
• Following the success of RC hole GRC1014, Gateway planned a single diamond drill-hole (GDD027) to
test the reinterpreted anomaly generated by the historic FLTEM survey (Figure 2), based on the revised
understanding of the regional geology. This hole was located approximately 450m south-east of the
previous RC drilling.
4 See ASX Release 27 November 2013.
5 See ASX Release 5 February 2024.

• Hole GDD027 was completed to a depth of 548.8m and intersected a thick basalt unit overlaying a
volcano-sedimentary rock sequence of conglomerates, shales and volcaniclastics containing variable
amounts of sulphides (pyrite+pyrrhotite).
• The targeted host mafic-ultramafic intrusion was also not intersected and, as such, the source of observed
sulphide mineralisation hosted in the two RC holes (GRC283 and GRC1014) located 200m to the north
is still open.
• The southern strike extent of the unit and mineralisation intersected in these two RC holes is still untested
for over 700m, with a mafic-ultramafic unit and Cu-Ni mineralisation indicated in historic hole GRC306
(see Figure 3).
DHEM Survey Results
• Following the completion of drilling, a down-hole EM (DHEM) survey crew was mobilised and successfully
surveyed the hole. The data generated by this survey was compiled and modelled by the Company’s
consultant geophysicists.
• This modelling process highlighted the fact that, although significant zones of sulphide were intersected
by GDD027, the conductance of these zones, being composed primarily of pyrite+pyrrhotite, was not
sufficient to explain the strength of the anomaly generated by the historic FLTEM survey.
• In addition, the DHEM data indicated that there was a significant off-hole anomaly building at the end of
the hole within the sedimentary rock package (Figure 4).
• This off-hole EM anomalism is not consistent with the logged geology, and indicates a potential conductor
located further to the west of the current drill-hole. However, this potential off-hole conductor was not able
to be modelled effectively based on the current DHEM data.
New Target Horizon
• Interpretation of the geology based on the historic drilling as well as GDD027, in conjunction with the
processing of the DHEM data, suggests that the targeted mafic/ultramafic intrusive unit is located further
to the west of hole GDD027.
• This position remains as a primary target for the source of copper-nickel-PGE sulphides intersected by
RC drilling.
• The indications of an off-hole conductor in this position, further to the west of GDD027, is extremely
encouraging.
• Combined with indications of mafic/ultramafic in historic RC and air-core drilling to the south (Figure 2),
this presents as a potential +700m target zone, with confirmed presence of copper-nickel-PGE sulphide-
hosted mineralisation.
• In order to progress this target, a comprehensive air-core program has recently been completed to map
the mafic-ultramafic intrusive unit between existing intersections in RC drilling and allow for the planning
of future diamond drilling to test the potential source of copper-nickel-PGE sulphides.
As outlined previously (see ASX release 5 February 2024), this target at Flametree forms part of a significant
corridor of potential mafic/ultramafic intrusive activity west of the Montague Granodiorite dome, as indicated by
interpretation of regional ground gravity survey data and Gateway’s recent two-dimensional seismic survey (see
Figure 5).
The positive identification of significant magmatic hosted copper-nickel-PGE mineralisation would highlight the
exciting prospectivity of the Montague Project for this style of deposit.
Montague Range Geochemical Sampling
First pass fine-fraction soil geochemical sampling has recently been completed at the Montague Range mafic-
ultramafic intrusive unit, located approximately 8km north of the Montague Granodiorite Dome (see Figure 3)6.
6 See ASX Release 5 July 2024.

Sampling was carried out on 400m x 50m sample spacing, with all samples analysed for an extensive multi-
element assay suite. The sampling program was highly successful, with the data received highlighting the
potential of this emerging Cu-Ni-PGE target area:
• Assays have mapped out prospective mafic-ultramafic units particularly through Ni and PGE responses
(see Figure 6).
• Coupled with this, discrete areas of copper anomalism have been identified, which present as highly
encouraging target areas, as the increase in copper response relative to the Ni-PGE lithological response
suggests a potential mineralisation source.
• As illustrated in Figure 7, several historic shallow drill holes have intersected Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation
within the oxide zone, further elevating the exploration potential of this complex.
• This has elevated the prospectivity of this mafic-intrusive complex as a potential host for Cu-Ni-PGE
mineralisation.
• Limited effective electrical geophysical surveys have been carried out on the area, and largely focused
on the volcanic interface in local stratigraphy (based on targeting VHMS-type mineralisation).
Following these highly encouraging results, the Company has recently mobilised a consultant geologist to site
who specialises in these mafic-ultramafic hosted deposits to undertake detailed mapping of the intrusive system.
This mapping has identified the geometry of the intrusive system and identify prospective zones to be followed
up with electrical geophysical surveys as well as possible stratigraphic drilling.
