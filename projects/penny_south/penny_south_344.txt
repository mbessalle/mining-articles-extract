ASX Announcement   
 
 
 
 
 
                  30 August 2024 
Acquisition of Penny South Gold Project, WA 
 
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• 
Binding Tenement Sale Agreement to acquire 100% of the Penny South Gold 
Project (E57/1045) to bolster West Australian Gold exploration portfolio 
• 
Penny South Gold Project located in world class gold district and ~550m south 
of one of Australia’s highest grade producing gold mines1, the Penny 
West/North Gold Mine (“Penny”), owned and operated by Ramelius Resources 
Limited (ASX:RMS) (“Ramelius”): 
‒ 
The Penny West mine produced 154,000t at 18g/t Au (89,000 Au) in the early 
1990’s2. 
‒ 
The initial Penny North deposit of 569,000t at 16.8g/t (306,000oz) was 
discovered by Spectrum Metals Limited and subsequently subject to a 
takeover by Ramelius for >$200M during 20203, with the deposit now being 
mined and extended. 
• 
The Penny West Shear, which hosts the Penny deposits, continues south into the 
Penny South Project (E57/1045) with ~2.5km of strike contained in E57/1045. 
• 
Average historical drill hole depth across E57/1045 is ~42m, with only 18 holes 
deeper than 100m and 7 holes deeper than 200m45, with no diamond drilling. 
• 
Historic drilling within E57/1045 has encountered various significantly 
anomalous intersections of gold mineralisation5. 
• 
Review of all available data to generate high priority drill targets underway. 
 
NickelX Limited (ASX: NKL or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding 
tenement sale agreement to acquire 100% of tenement E57/1045 known as the Penny South Gold 
Project.  
Commenting on the acquisition Managing Director Peter Woods said:  
“We are extremely pleased to have reached an agreement for the acquisition of the Penny South 
Project. The addition of this exciting gold exploration asset next door to one of the highest-grade gold 
mines in production in Western Australia, and in a district seeing current M&A activity, greatly 
enhances our existing portfolio. Given the minimal deeper drilling and lack of diamond drilling, it is the 
Company’s view there may be substantial value to be unlocked at depth and we are eager to execute 
a path forward to test the theory as the momentum for gold continues.”

Penny South Gold Project, WA 
The Penny South Gold Project (E57/1045) (Map 1) lies only 550m south of Ramelius’ operating Penny 
West/North gold mine project (Map 2), which is estimated to contain 440,000t of ore at 22g/t Au 
(320,000oz Au) (“Penny”)6. NKL’s Penny South Gold Project captures a ~2.5km strike extension of the 
Penny West Shear immediately south of Ramelius’ Penny deposits, southern Youanmi Greenstone Belt 
(Map 3).

As at the Penny deposits, tenement E57/1045 contains limited outcrop and with the prospective 
bedrock almost everywhere overlain by 1-30m of windblown sand and other sediments. 
Historic drilling at the Penny South Gold Project has encountered various significantly anomalous 
intersections of gold mineralisation, which are currently being compiled and assessed. Over 1,000 drill 
holes have been completed within E57/1045, mostly RAB and AC holes with RC holes accounting for 
only ~3% of the drill holes. The average downhole length of the historic drill holes within the Penny 
South Gold Project is ~42m with only 18 holes deeper than 100m and 7 holes deeper than 200m. There 
has been no diamond drilling completed at Penny South. 
Spectrum Metals Limited, which owned the Penny West Project prior to being taken over by Ramelius 
in 2020 for ~$215M, reported outstanding exploration success at Penny North and at the southern 
end of the Penny West pit within deeper drill holes beneath cover. NickelX intends to utilise a similar 
exploration strategy to reinterpret all available data and to test targets at depth. 
Key Acquisition Terms  
NickelX has entered into a binding tenement sale agreement to acquire a 100% interest in E57/1045 
(the Penny South Gold Project) from Aurum Resources Limited (ASX:AUE) (“Aurum”), the key terms 
of the acquisition are as follows:  
• 
NickelX will pay A$60,000 in cash and issue 3,000,000 shares at a deemed price of $0.02 ($60,000) 
to acquire 100% of the Project. 
• 
A deferred cash consideration of A$500,000 is to be paid upon the achievement of at least 
50,000oz Au resource as defined in the JORC Code (2012 Edition) with a grade of at least 1 g/t or 
more; and a further $500,000 to be paid for every additional 50,000oz Au resource with a grade 
of at least 1 g/t or more, within 5 years following Completion of the acquisition. 
• 
Completion of the acquisition and the issue of the 3,00,000 shares to the vendors is subject to 
shareholder approval pursuant to Listing Rule 7.1, and receipt of customary third party approvals. 
Shareholder approval will be sought at the Company’s upcoming EGM for the proposed share issue to 
Aurum, by way of an addendum to the existing resolutions to be contemplated at the EGM. 
NKL will also enter into a deed of assumption in respect of an existing 1% royalty on the Penny South 
Gold Project tenement. 
Location and Access Details 
Tenement E57/1045 is located approximately 450km northeast of Perth and 100km southwest of 
Sandstone (Map 1). Access to the tenement is via the Great Northern Highway and the unsealed 
Paynes Find to Sandstone Road as far as Youanmi and then southwards on the Youanmi to Lake Barlee 
Road. Access within the tenement area is via fence line tracks and historic exploration tracks. The 
licence E57/1045 currently consists of 4 blocks covering 9.95km2.

The Penny South Gold Project lies directly to the south of the Penny West/North gold mine project 
(Map 2), which is estimated to contain 440,000t of ore at 22g/t Au (320,000oz Au) (“Penny”)7. 
Geological Summary8 
Tenement E57/1045 is located at the southern end of the Youanmi Greenstone Belt, which straddles 
the boundary of the Murchison and Southern Cross Domains that is marked by the regionally extensive 
Youanmi shear zone. 
The Project lies to the south of the historic Penny West gold mine and covers approximately 2.5km of 
strike of the Youanmi Greenstone Belt, dominated by mafic and ultramafic rocks (Map 3). There is 
very little outcrop of the Archaean basement lithologies with the vast majority of the Project area 
covered by aeolian sand and other transported sediments reportedly up to 30m thick, averaging 
around 10m in thickness. 
Gold mineralisation at the Penny South Gold Project is controlled by the Youanmi shear zone and 
hosted in the hangingwall of mafic schists. Historic drilling across E57/1045 reveals a sequence of 
north-south striking mafic and ultramafic rocks of variable magnetic intensity from non- to moderately 
magnetic. Analytical and lithological data suggest that the historic gold intercepts are associated with 
quartz veins, sheared geological contacts and granodiorite.  
The Penny West gold mine host stratigraphy to the north is a sequence of steeply dipping mafic and 
ultramafic rocks with minor felsic intrusive where gold mineralisation is associated with steeply east 
dipping quartz-sulphide veins up to 5m in width. The Penny West mineralisation at the base of the 
historic open pit (80m depth) to the base of drilling at 220m depth indicates the mineralised lode dips 
to the east at 65-80° with strike extent of 300m. The main lodes typically have sharp boundaries 
controlled by shears and minor zones of discontinuous mineralisation occur in the hangingwall of the 
main lodes. The deposit is characterised by structurally controlled gold-quartz veins in a brittle-ductile 
shear zone. High grade gold is typically associated with sulphides such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, 
sphalerite and chalcopyrite. 
Mineralisation at Penny North is considered contemporaneous in origin to Penny West and is 
characterised by abundant vein quartz and sulphides. From drilling, the mineralisation has been 
interpreted to have an upper limit of 80m below surface and extend to a depth of 320m below surface 
with the orebody modelled as a gently south plunging shoot with a north-south extent of 400m and a 
vertical extent of 240m. The mineralisation is developed along a contact between gabbro and 
granodiorite. Wallrocks are typically mylonitic and display albite and sericite alteration. The quartz 
veins are variably massive, laminated or brecciated with a highly variable sulphide assemblage of 
pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite.

Next Steps 
The Company, together with its consultants, will seek to compile and review all geological, 
geochemical, and historic drill hole data with the aim to define high priority drilling targets at depths 
greater than 80m below surface, a search space that has been neglected by previous explorers. The 
Company will also investigate the use of electrical geophysics such as IP and/or EM in the search for 
Penny-style quartz-sulphide lodes.
