Vancouver, British Columbia – TheNewswire - March 25, 2025, Rockland Resources Ltd. (the “Company” or "Rockland") (CSE: RKL), is pleased to announce the acquisition of the Claybank Beryllium Project in Juab County, Utah, located five kilometers northeast of Spor Mountain, the largest global beryllium producer operated by Materion Corp. (NYSE: MTRN)(1). Claybank connects via a 4.5km spur to the paved Brush Highway that is used to ship ore from Spor Mountain’s mining operations to their treatment plant located 15 kilometers northeast of Delta, Utah. The location of Claybank relative to Spor Mountain and to Rockland’s Beryllium Butte Project is provided below.

“We are very excited to acquire Claybank which along with our Beryllium Butte Project to the west, strengthens our mandate to become a force in the niche global beryllium market.” stated Mike England, CEO of Rockland. “The global demand for beryllium is growing and Utah is the home of the largest source of beryllium in the world, making it an easy decision where to focus our efforts. Our next steps at Claybank will be to confirm historical results with the intent to expand the historic mineralized zone.”

Claybank Beryllium Project

The Claybank Beryllium Project consists of two unpatented claims with a contiguous area of roughly 16 hectares (40 acres). The property saw historical drilling in 1987 with 31 vertical drill holes distributed along strike of an altered Tertiary tuff that is the host rock for bertrandite ore being mined at Spor Mountain. Nineteen of the drillholes were closely-spaced and identified a zone of beryllium mineralization roughly 70 meters along strike of the tuff. Historical assays for the mineralization zone reported drillhole intercepts from 0.25-0.65% Be.(2)  

The images below show the location of Claybank relative to the Spor Mountain Mine, and the locations of the mineralization zone defined from the historical drilling.

Note that the historical data reported for Claybank has not been confirmed by the Company - historical results must be treated with caution when considering the potential economics of a deposit. The resources at Spor Mountain Mine are not necessarily indicative of what may exist at Claybank.

A spring reconnaissance surface sampling and mapping program over the Claybank property will commence once weather and access become favorable.

Terms of the acquisition, which was finalized on March 19, 2025, call for cumulative cash payments of $400,000 USD plus the granting of a staged release of one million warrants of the Company at $0.15 CAD. A 2.5% NSR will be granted to the vendor of which Rockland can purchase back, at any time, one percent for one million dollars USD. No finder’s fees were incurred in the acquisition of the project. 

The Company also announces it has set 25,000 options to a consultant of the Company at $0.15 for a period of two years in accordance with the Company’s stock option plan.
