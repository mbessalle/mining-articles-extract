Golden Mile confirms joint venture-acquisition over
highly prospective copper project in Arizona, USA
HIGHLIGHTS
• Golden Mile has entered into a joint venture-acquisition agreement with Outcrop Silver &
Gold Corporation (“Outcrop”) for the Pearl Copper Project located in Arizona, United States.
• Initial field reconnaissance has delineated multiple targets within the project area. This
highlights the near-term drill, and company making potential, of the Odyssey and Ford
Prospects.
• At Odyssey, which hosts the historic artisanal Pearl (Cu-Zn-Ag-Au) Mine, multiple vein
targets up to five metres wide extend continuously for approximately 800m and are evident
at the surface.
• At Ford, limited historic data indicates a shaft was developed to a depth of around 70
metres. Polymetallic Cu-Pb-Ag-Au-Zn vein type mineralisation, up to five metres wide, was
mined before excess water halted operations in circa 1942.
• Due Diligence indicates the Pearl Copper Project not only hosts near-term vein targets but
also shows widespread surface alteration, suggesting the presence of intrusive
disseminated mineralisation, making it a significant Cu-porphyry target.
• Golden Mile and Outcrop have agreed on terms for Golden Mile to acquire up to a 100%
ownership of the Pearl Copper Project through a staged, earn in and dilution, investment of
up to $A 12 million over eight years along with up to a 2% net smelter royalty.

Overview
Golden Mile Resources Limited (“Golden Mile”; “the Company”; ASX: “G88”) is pleased to report the
Company has completed successful due diligence and entered into a joint venture-acquisition
agreement with Outcrop Silver & Gold Corporation (“Outcrop”) over the Pearl Copper Project located
in Arizona, United States of America (“USA”).
A recently completed field trip, undertaken as part of the due diligence, has confirmed the very high
prospectivity of the project area for company-making copper resources.
Figure 1: Significant Copper Mines and Projects in Arizona USA
This field examination, undertaken in late July, and while only preliminary in nature, has delineated
the Odyssey and the Ford prospects within the Pearl project area as immediate highly prospective,
exploration drill targets.
At Odyssey, a sub outcropping multiple vein copper target with surface mineralised widths up to five
metres and a strike length of around 800 metres has been mapped. This prospect hosts the historic
largely artisanal Pearl working’s where historical records indicate around 60,000 of ore containing
copper oxide and sulphide, lead, silver, and gold was produced from 1915 to 1941 (Force, 1997).

There is no historic record or field evidence that the prospect has ever been drilled.
At Ford, which is a circa 1940’s copper-zinc development, extensive surficial alteration suggests a well-
developed mineralised system over which mining is reported to have ceased because of high water
flows at shallow depths (55 metres). Historic data (Baird, 1942) indicates grades up to 10.6% copper,
31.3% lead and 0.54oz (16.7 g/t) gold.
As for Odyssey there is no historic record or field evidence that the prospect has ever been drilled.
Golden Mile’s Managing Director, Damon Dormer stated:
“The completion of due diligence has reinforced our belief in the Pearl Copper Project as a potential
game-changer for the Company. Our initial field reconnaissance has already identified two
advanced targets, which, if they were in Australia, would have been heavily drilled by now.
The fact that both the Odyssey and Ford Prospects remain undrilled, despite showing all the surface
characteristics of major mineralised systems, presents Golden Mile with a fast-tracked opportunity
to make a significant copper discovery.
Located within the world-class Laramide Porphyry Copper Belt, which hosts numerous significant
deposits and mines, the Pearl Project’s exploration potential is substantial.
With due diligence complete and the formal agreement in place, we are eager to commence work
on this promising exploration venture.”
PEARL COPPER PROJECT
The Pearl Copper Project (“Pearl” and/or the “Project”) is situated in the San Manuel mining district,
Pinal County, Arizona, approximately 40km north-east of Tucson, near the town of Mammoth.
Arizona is a Tier 1 mining jurisdiction, and the USA’s top copper producing state. It is also an
established and attractive mining jurisdiction, ranking No. 7 in 2023’s Investment Attractiveness Index
by the Fraser Institute. It is supported by world class infrastructure which includes sealed roads,
railways and mains power transmission lines, with access to a highly skilled workforce.
Pearl lies within the world-class Laramide Porphyry Copper Province, within the prolific Southwestern
North American Porphyry Copper Province. This is the principal copper metallogenic province of the
USA, accounting for approximately 70% of total USA copper production in 2023.
The Project consists of 241 unpatented mining claims (4,983 acres), approximately 20.2km2, with
numerous copper occurrences, over 50 historic artisanal workings, and the historic Ford copper mine.
It has had minimal modern exploration yet is situated immediately north of BHP’s San Manuel-
Kalamazoo Mine, one of the largest deposits in the Laramide Porphyry Copper Province.
It also lies within the same geological trend as Capstone Copper’s Pinto Valley mine which to date has
produced over 4 billion pounds of copper

Project Geology
Within the Project area, porphyry copper prospective, Laramide age igneous rocks, situated
immediately north of San-Manuel-Kalamazoo, have been identified. Initial geological mapping has
also identified propylitic alteration and fault architecture similar to the San Manuel-Kalamazoo
deposit.
The Project area exhibits widespread mineralisation associated with epithermal veins, including the
Odyssey Prospect with visible copper mineralisation over more than 800 metres at surface. Propylitic
alteration observed in this prospect and the greater Pearl project area suggests significant exploration
potential for the presence of an underlying porphyry hydrothermal system.
Figure 2: Laramide Porphyry Copper Belt showing Pearl Project and major copper mines
At the Project, the basement (Proterozoic) rocks are locally overprinted by propylitic (chlorite-epidote-
carbonate) alteration, which is a common feature in distal porphyry hydrothermal systems. The
propylitic alteration occurs in several areas along a NW-SE trending zone roughly parallel to the San
Manuel fault that bisects the + 1 billion tonne San Manuel-Kalamazoo orebody.
Chlorite-epidote-carbonate ± silica-sericite (propylitic) alteration occurs within this NW-SE trending
zone and has been interpreted as related to the circulation of hydrothermal fluid.

Regional mapping conducted by Outcrop also identified porphyry dykes which have been dated as
coinciding in age, with the reported timing of formation of the San Manuel-Kalamazoo copper deposit
(approximately 68 Ma8).

mining claims and the proximity of San Manuel – Kalamazoo and Tiger Mine
Mineralisation
Numerous historic workings within the Project area relate to NW to NNW trending mineralised
structures, hosting quartz veins with disseminated pyrite, galena, and copper oxide mineralisation.
Immediately to the east of the Project area (600m) is the Tiger Mines area, which produced over
400,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, 6 million pounds of molybdenum oxide, 2.5 million
pounds of vanadium pentoxide, 70 million pounds of lead, and 50 million pounds of zinc. This
polymetallic mineralisation is hosted in faults trending NW to NNW.
The most significant working within the Project area are the Pearl and Ford Mines. The Pearl Mine is
located on the north-western portion of the Project within the Odyssey Prospect. It produced up to
60,000 tons of ore containing copper oxide and sulphide, lead, silver and gold from largely artisanal
workings from 1915 to 1941 (Force, 1997).

The structural trend of the mineralisation is NW-NNW with lines made by historic workings to the
north and south along this strike direction.

The Ford Mine, located in the eastern section of the Project, targeted an intensely altered and faulted
zone with production commencing in 1900. While ore production is unknown, high grades were
reported from lead-silver veins and historic surface and underground sampling (Baird, 1942) reported
the following:
• Lead assays ran from 5.7% to 31.3%
• Copper assays ran from 5.8% to 10.6%
• Gold increases in the deeper levels from 0.01 oz to 0.54 oz (16.7g/t)
Limited historic mine data suggests mining was terminated at around 55-60 metres with anecdotal
evidence indicating this was the result of increased water ingress, which as a result of the pumping
technology at that time, made further mining unprofitable.
Recent work by Outcrop included detailed geological mapping, rock-chip sampling and soil sampling.
Numerous highly anomalous copper and molybdenum bearing soil samples were observed, with up
to 1,415 ppm copper, 674 ppm molybdenum, 4,860 ppm lead, 2,580 ppm zinc, and 1.46 g/t silver
(Appendix 4).

Photo 4: Ford Prospect showing adit location and extensive alteration
At least two large, anomalous copper-in-soil footprints have been identified, each measuring greater
than 1 km by 1 km. Highly significant rock chip samples contain visible copper mineralisation with
assays up to 7.3% Cu, 0.43% Mo, 19.9% Pb, 4.9% Zn, 360 g/t Ag (Appendix 2).
The Laramide Porphyry Copper Belt
The Laramide Porphyry Copper Belt (Figure 4) is one of the most significant copper-producing regions
in the world.
It extends from northern Mexico through the southwestern USA, encompassing parts of Arizona, New
Mexico, and Sonora, Mexico. This belt is characterized by its numerous large-scale porphyry copper
deposits, which formed during the Laramide Orogeny (approximately 80 to 40 million years ago).
The Laramide Orogeny was a period of intense mountain building and magmatism resulting from the
subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American plate.
This tectonic activity created the right conditions for the formation of porphyry copper systems,
including extensive magmatic intrusions and hydrothermal fluid circulation.

INVESTMENT DECISION
The drivers for the investment have been based on an array of factors set out below:
The Laramide Porphyry Copper Province is highly prospective for copper deposits of significant size

Sampling
techniques |  |  | • Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific
specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals
under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF
instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad
meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public
Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold
that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation
types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. |  |  | Rock Chip Sampling
Samples were collected geological consultant SERAC Exploration,
commissioned by Zacapa Resources Limited.
Samples were collected using industry standard procedures.
Soil Sampling
Soil samples were collected using industry standard procedures.
Samples taken from a depth of approximately 10-30cm with a -20 mesh sieve
and approx. 700g collected. |  | 
Drilling
techniques |  |  | • Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast,
auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard
tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc). |  |  | Not Applicable. No drilling. |  | 
Drill sample
recovery |  |  | • Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and
results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative
nature of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether
sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse
material. |  |  | Not Applicable. No drilling |  | 
Logging |  |  | • Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically
logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation,
mining studies and metallurgical studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean,
channel, etc) photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. |  |  | Soil Sampling
