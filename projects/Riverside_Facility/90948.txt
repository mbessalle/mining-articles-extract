# NOVONIX Receives Approval for Purchase of Enterprise South Land for Planned Enterprise South Manufacturing Facility

BRISBANE, Australia, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVONIX Limited (NASDAQ: NVX, ASX: NVX) (“NOVONIX” or “the Company”), a leading battery materials and technology company, announced today, that it has received unanimous approval from each of the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County for the purchase of a 182-acre parcel of land for its second mass production plant (“Enterprise South”). Enterprise South will be acquired for approximately US$4.6 million and will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to be specified in the purchase and sale agreement. The Company also received an estimated US$54 million in net tax and other benefits to be realised over a 15-year period and are subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions. These transactions remain subject to final approval by the Chattanooga Industrial Development Board.

To meet increasing customer demand, the Company previously announced plans for its next large-scale synthetic graphite manufacturing plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Enterprise South is expected to reach full production capacity of 31,500 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) by the end of 2028 and is anticipated to create 500 full-time jobs. The Enterprise South facility, together with NOVONIX’s existing Riverside facility which is scaling up to production of 20,000 tpa, is planned to bring the Company’s total production capacity to over 50,000 tpa in Chattanooga by 2028.

Mr. Robert Long, Interim CEO of NOVONIX, said: “We are pleased to announce this next step in our expansion in Chattanooga and deepen our roots in the local community as we continue to grow as a company. We have worked closely with the city, county, and state over the past seven years of operations in Chattanooga. They have been great partners and we, in turn, are proud to strengthen our local hiring and workforce development commitments to the community.”

In addition to the commitments contained in the Company’s local Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement, NOVONIX also announced the extension and expansion of its local partnership with Lookout Valley Middle High School, NOVONIX Institute of Advanced Battery Technology (NIABT). As part of Hamilton County School’s Future Ready Institutes, the NIABT provides career-focused learning aimed at equipping students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the battery industry and other STEM innovation fields.In December, the Company announced a conditional commitment from the DOE through the Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) for a direct loan of up to US$754.8 million to be applied towards the financing of NOVONIX Enterprise South.

NOVONIX’s Riverside facility, also located in Chattanooga, is poised to become the first large-scale production site dedicated to high-performance synthetic graphite for the battery sector in North America. It is slated to begin commercial production in early 2026, with plans to grow output to 20,000 tpa to meet current customer commitments. Previously, the Company announced that the DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (“MESC”) awarded the Company a US$100 million grant and that it was selected for a US$103 million investment tax credit towards the funding of the Riverside facility. NOVONIX has signed binding offtake agreements to supply synthetic graphite to Panasonic Energy, Stellantis, and PowerCo, committing its full production capacity at its Riverside facility and triggering the need for additional capacity at Enterprise South.23456
