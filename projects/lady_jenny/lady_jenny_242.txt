HAMMER PROCEEDS WITH OPTION 
ON LADY JENNY MINING LEASE 
 
• 
Hammer has completed due diligence relating to an option to purchase 
an 80% interest in the granted Lady Jenny Mining Leases, strategically 
located near Hammer’s defined JORC Mineral Resources within its 
broader Mount Isa copper-gold portfolio.  
• 
Hammer has commenced earthworks in preparation for a reverse 
circulation drilling program to test the copper sulphide mineralised zone.  
The drilling program was expected to commence at the end of October but has 
been delayed due to bushfire interruptions around Cloncurry.

• 
The Lady Jenny Mining Leases have previously been mined for copper oxide 
ore that was transported to a processing facility in Cloncurry. Mining was 
suspended as the orebody transitioned into copper sulphide 
mineralisation. 
• 
The two Mining Leases (ML2701 and ML90601) are completely surrounded 
by Hammer’s 100%-owned EPM26904. Previous mining appears to have 
been limited by the northern tenement boundary, with potential identified for 
extensions of the mineralised zone to the north and south of the pit.. 
• 
Preparation for drilling at Tourist Zone South has been completed whilst 
preparations at Kalman South East are expected to be completed in the 
coming days.
