HAMMER ACQUIRES OPTION ON 
LADY JENNY MINING LEASE 
 
• 
Hammer has secured an option to purchase an 80% interest in the 
granted Lady Jenny Mining Leases, strategically located near Hammer’s 
defined JORC Mineral Resources within its broader Mount Isa copper-gold 
portfolio.  
• 
The Lady Jenny Mining Leases have previously been mined for copper oxide 
ore that was transported to a processing facility in Cloncurry. Mining was 
suspended as the orebody transitioned into copper sulphide 
mineralisation. 
• 
The two Mining Leases (ML2701 and ML90601) are completely surrounded 
by Hammer’s 100%-owned EPM26904. Previous mining appears to have 
been limited by the northern tenement boundary, with potential identified for 
extensions of the mineralised zone to the north and south of the pit. 
• 
Subject to due diligence and receipt of approvals, Hammer is planning 
to commence drilling to test the copper sulphide mineralised zone 
towards the end of October. 
• 
Historical drilling records are in the process of being verified by Hammer.

Hammer’s Managing Director, Daniel Thomas said: 
“This region continues to deliver substantial opportunities associated with historical mining operations. As we’ve 
seen with neighbouring projects, the propensity for these historical mines to deliver high grades of copper from 
close to surface offers Hammer an advanced exploration opportunity.   
“The Lady Jenny Mining Lease is entirely complementary to our established exploration tenure and our existing 
hub copper-gold resources at Kalman, Jubilee, Lakeview, Elaine and Overlander. The establishment of another 
potential source of ore for a regional processing mill represents another piece of the Mount Isa Inlier puzzle 
and will ensure that Hammer’s already substantial Resource inventory continues to grow.   
“As the region looks to establish the next set of mines to replace the Mount Isa copper operation, advanced 
prospects such as Lady Jenny, with proven production potential, will have a tremendous opportunity to 
expeditiously deliver the mines of tomorrow. The added bonus of this prospect is that it is located on a granted 
Mining Lease, with Hammer holding all of the tenure surrounding the established mine.”

Hammer Metals Ltd (ASX: HMX) (“Hammer” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered 
into a binding term sheet with Corella Valley Corporation Pty Ltd (Corella) to acquire an option to purchase an 
80% interest in the Lady Jenny Mining Leases, a historic copper and gold mining operation in NW Queensland 
surrounded by Hammer’s existing Mount Isa exploration tenure.

Lady Jenny Background and History 
Lady Jenny is located approximately 16km south along the Fountain Springs Road from the sealed Barkly 
Highway that runs between Mount Isa and Cloncurry in north-west Queensland. The Mining Leases are located 
within Hammer’s 100%-owned Exploration Licenses and in close proximity to the Company’s defined JORC 
Mineral Resources at Kalman, Overlander, Lakeview, Elaine and Jubilee.  
The Lady Jenny Mining Leases (ML2701 and ML90601) cover an area of approximately 26Ha with the Lady 
Jenny copper trend appearing to plunge shallowly to moderately north-north-east into Hammer’s surrounding 
exploration permit.  
The deposit has been mined historically by both underground and surface extraction methods, although surface 
extraction has been minimal with minor open pit ore cuts to maximum of 16m below surface. 
Mining at Lady Jenny has occurred in many forms during the historical copper rushes around the Ballara mining 
centre. Most recently, oxide ore was extracted from Lady Jenny and processed at the Cloncurry oxide treatment 
centre. Historical exploration activities have occurred on the property with Hammer looking to verify and digitise 
these results with a view to further exploring the property along the highly encouraging strike extent.  
As part of the diligence process, Hammer has completed a basic rock chip analysis of material from within the 
existing pit, highlighting the high-grade nature of the existing workings. Rock chips grading up to 58.5% copper 
were recorded using PXRF analysis; without the benefit of assay, this provides an estimate only of the potential 
copper samples within the existing pit.  
Hammer has also completed a first-pass review of the potential of the ground within Hammer’s existing EPM 
and has identified the Lady Jenny structure, 300m to the south of the current pit, with anomalous copper rock 
chips with laboratory analysis returning grades of up to 1.52% copper and 0.15g/t Au (Table 1).

Lady Jenny Upcoming Activities 
Hammer intends to commence an exploration program at Lady Jenny to verify historical records and test the 
mineralised system at depth. The program is expected to commence late this month and is expected to pave 
the way for the release of a JORC Mineral Resource at the prospect during 2025.  
 
* The samples depicted above are grab samples of in-pit material. Note that the portable XRF analyses cannot be 
considered representative of larger zones of mineralisation which may or may not be present below the current pit floor. 
Consequently, these analyses are indicative only and utilised herein to illustrate the variation of Copper mineralisation 
present within the pit area. The analyses were conducted on hand specimens with no sample preparation having been 
conducted.

The Project’s location within an existing Mining Lease provides Hammer with the opportunity to expedite the 
development of the prospect, providing a near-term cash generation opportunity for the Company.   
Pending the successful identification of near-surface copper sulphides, the Project has several potential 
commercialisation pathways at nearby copper concentrators at Mt Isa, Ernest Henry, Eloise and Rocklands.  
As part of the upcoming programs, Hammer will also test the potential extension of the Lady Jenny deposit into 
Hammer’s existing exploration permit as well as further examining the potential trends at the Neptune group of 
prospects and the nearby Lord Nelson prospect, where Hammer drilled some promising intersections in 2022 
and early 2023 respectively including (see ASX Announcement 12 May 2022 and7 March 2023):  
• 
100m at 0.48% Cu and 0.18g/t Au from 173m in HMLRRC002 including: 
o 
3m at 2.2% Cu and 0.20g/t Au, from 185m;  
o 
3m at 3.1% Cu and 1.4g/t Au from 198m; and  
o 
5m at 2.21% Cu and 0.37g/t Au from 234m   
• 
15m at 2% Cu and 0.34g/t Au in LKTPDM001; and 
• 
5m at 1.72% Cu and 1.18g/t Au from 14m within a mineralised envelope of 21m @ 0.59% Cu and 
0.33g/t Au from surface in HMLNRC001.

Acquisition Terms 
Hammer has secured an option to purchase an 80% interest in the Lady Jenny Mining Leases. 
An Option Payment fee of A$100,000 and $50,000 in Hammer shares is payable by Hammer upon the fulfilment 
of the condition’s precedent including Hammer completing satisfactory due diligence on the tenements. 
The quantum of Hammer shares to be issued, on satisfaction of the condition’s precedent, will be determined 
using the 10 day Volume Weighted Average Price of Hammer’s shares as at close of business on 1 October 
2024.  Shares issued as part of the option payment fee will be escrowed for six months from the date of issue. 
 
 
Page 6 of 14 
An option period of 24 months will allow Hammer to accurately define the size and grade of a potential resource 
on the property with a payment of A$500,000 required to secure an 80% interest in the project.  
Hammer will remain responsible for the costs associated with the exploration program until it completes the 
purchase of the interest in the project. Upon completion of the acquisition, both parties will be responsible for 
their pro-rata expenditure or be diluted based upon a standard JV dilution formula.  
Should Corella’s interest be diluted to less than 5%, their interest will convert to a 1% net smelter royalty.

Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut 
channels, 
random 
chips, 
or 
specific 
specialised industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down hole gamma 
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc).  
 
These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
Include reference to measures taken to

Aspects 
of 
the 
determination 
of 
mineralisation that are Material to the Public 
Report. 
 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has 
been done this would be relatively simple 
(e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to 
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire 
assay’). In other cases, more explanation 
may be required, such as where there is 
coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. 
Unusual 
commodities 
or 
mineralisation

(e.g. 
submarine 
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed 
information. 
Drilling 
No new drilling is reported in this release. 
 
 
Hammer Rock Chip Sampling 
The rock chip sampling reported herein is grab 
sampling. The method is utilised to determine 
general tenor and element mix for a given 
small area and is not intended to convey ideas 
of continuity.  
Sample size is in the range of 2 to 5kg. 
All samples submitted for assay underwent 
fine crush with 1kg riffled off for pulverising to 
75 microns.  
 
Samples were submitted to ALS for: 
• Fire Assay with AAS finish for gold. 
• 4 acid digest followed by ICP-MS for a 
comprehensive element suite.

Portable 
XRF 
analyses 
on 
selected rock samples 
Five portable XRF analyses are noted in this 
release. 
The analyses were undertaken on grab 
samples of loose and outcrop material within 
the Lady Jenny pit. The aim was to illustrate 
Cu mineralisation and the variation in Cu 
grades. 
The portable XRF used was an Olympus 
Vanta.  
No sample preparation was conducted and 
only single readings were conducted on each 
sample. 
 
The reader should note that the use of portable 
XRF analyses should be treated with caution.

Lady Jenny 
Lady Jenny is hosted within the Ballara

Argylla 
Formation. 
This 
large-scale 
geological setting is common to other 
Hammer Metals Prospects in the region 
such as the Neptune Group of prospects 
1km to the north of Lady Jenny.  
Mineralisation parallels lithology with a 
moderate northwesterly dip and a 20-30 
degree north-northeasterly plunge. 
Examination of pit walls indicates that 
mineralisation is up to 6m in true thickness 
however, an envelope of ferruginous 
fractured sediments occur on both the 
hangingwall and footwall suggesting that 
there is significant potential for thicker 
zones to occur at depth and down plunge. 
The mineralisation is shear zone hosted 
with the closest analogue being the Mt Colin 
Cu mine currently operated by Aeris 
Resources Limited.

Information 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drill holes: 
easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation 
above sea level in metres) of the drill hole 
collar dip and azimuth of the hole 
down hole length and interception depth 
hole length. 
 
If the exclusion of this information is justified 
on the basis that the information is not 
Material and this exclusion does not detract 
from the understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain 
why this is the case. 
Drilling 
No drilling is reported in this release. 
 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of 
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high-grade results and 
longer lengths of low-grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation 
should 
be 
stated 
and 
some 
typical 
examples of such aggregations should be 
shown in detail. 
 
The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
Drilling 
No drilling is reported in this release. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths 
and 
intercept 
lengths 
These 
relationships 
are 
particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down 
hole length, true width not known’). 
Drilling 
No drilling is reported in this release. 
 
Diagrams 
Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts should 
be included for any significant discovery 
being reported These should include, but 
not be limited to a plan view of drill hole 
collar locations and appropriate sectional 
views. 
See attached figures. 
Balanced 
reporting 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced avoiding misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
Drilling 
No drilling is reported in this release.
