ASX Announcement 
 
21 October 2024 
 
 
$12 Million Sale and Farm-in Agreement on Twin Hills Signed 
 
KEY POINTS 
 
GBM Resources Limited (GBM or Company) has executed a long form Farm-in Agreement with 
Wise Walkers Limited (Wise Walkers) to earn up to a 70% joint venture interest in the Twin Hills 
Gold Project (Twin Hills) in relation to the Heads of Agreement signed and announced on 15 July 
2024. Refer to area highlighted in pale green in Appendix 3.  
 
GBM to receive a total A$6 million in cash consideration and Wise Walkers to sole fund further 
exploration of A$6 million over an 18-month period to earn a 70% interest. 
 
GBM will retain a 30% interest free carried to a decision to mine.  
 
GBM is pleased to advise that Wise Walkers, who are a significant and supportive shareholder with an 
interest of ~9.6% of the Company’s issued shares, has entered into a Farm-in Agreement to advance the 
Twin Hills Gold Project to a decision to mine. 
Highlights Include: 
i. 
There will be a reduction in expenditure costs by the Company as pursuant to the 
Farm-in Agreement Wise Walkers would be responsible for sole-funding exploration 
expenditure up to a maximum of $6 million during the farm-in period. 
ii. 
The Company will manage the farm-in exploration spend of $6 million. 
iii. 
The farm-in exploration expenditure has to be completed within a period of 18 months, 
during which time the Company will aim to expedite the development of Twin Hills. 
iv. 
The consideration payable for the Farm-in Agreement includes a $6 million cash 
component providing for certainty of value. 
v. 
The $6 million cash component of the total consideration payable provides an 
immediate cash injection to allow the Company to pursue its current projects and 
improve its financial position by reducing the Collins St Convertible Notes debt owing. 
vi. 
The Transaction allows the Company, together with Wise Walkers, to advance the 
Twin Hills project to a decision to mine.  The Company retains its 30% interest and has 
no further funding obligation during this phase. 
vii. 
The remaining conditions precedent outstanding are: 
1. GBM Shareholders approving the Farm-in transaction by resolution at the Annual 
General Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for late November 2024 (If required); 
and 
2. Newmont exercising or waiving its "Right of First Refusal" to match the Farm-in 
transaction over the next ~60 days.

Wise Walkers has paid GBM an exclusivity fee of A$1 million. A further A$2 million has been received at 
GBM’s solicitor’s trust account from Wise Walkers, with the remaining A$3 million cash payment to be 
paid by Wise Walkers following satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent. (refer Appendix 1 for a summary 
of the material terms and conditions). 
 
GBM Managing Director and CEO, Peter Rohner, commented: 
‘GBM has continued to look to realise value from the advancement of assets for GBM’s shareholders. 
GBM’s focus continues to be on the prospective Drummond Basin where large high grade epithermal 
gold deposits exist and where it has expanded JORC resources to ~ 1.84 Moz of gold. This Farm-in 
agreement and the agreement with Newmont on the Mt Coolon Project, provides funding and support to 
advance these two large prospective tenement packages. The sale component of this agreement 
provides the necessary funding to repay the Convertible Note when completed. GBM will now focus on 
advancing the Yandan Gold Project. Wise Walkers has been a supportive shareholder, and recent 
discussions have demonstrated significant opportunities in which they can assist to grow value”

About Twin Hills Mineral Resources 
 
The combined resource at Twin Hills of 23.11 Mt @ 1.3 g/t Au and 6.5 g/t Ag for 999,200 oz Au 
and 4,824,600 oz Ag with 60% of the resource now in Measured and Indicated categories.  
 
Lone Sister - Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE)  
 
The MRE for Lone Sister deposit comprises 12.48 Mt @ 1.2 g/t Au for 475,900 oz Au with 55% of the 
resource now in Measured and Indicated categories (Table 1).  GBM considers Twin Hills as a stand-
alone operation and the estimate includes open pit style resources that have captured most of the 
previously unreported gold mineralisation.  
 
The Lone Sister ore body is currently defined for 350 m along strike, over 400 m in height, and is 
approximately 150 m wide. The broadly tabular shape directly reflects mineralisation that is preferentially 
hosted within a rhyolite dyke with some evidence for limited mineralisation having formed within specific 
lithological units adjacent to the dyke. Higher grade gold mineralisation displays a distinct plunge to the 
north and remains open at depth.  
 
Gold mineralisation manifests as quartz-pyrite veinlets and disseminated pyrite with higher grades 
associated with increased vein density and higher pyrite percentage. Silicification is also significantly 
increased around mineralisation. 
 
 
309 - Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) 
 
The MRE for 309 deposit comprises 10.63 Mt @ 1.5 g/t Au for 523,300 oz Au with 64% of the resource 
now in Measured and Indicated categories (Table1).  
 
Currently defined gold mineralisation extends from surface downward for 380 m, along strike in a WNW 
direction for 380 m and NNE for 330 m. Overall, the system dips steeply to the south and plunges to the 
east with high grade gold mineralisation remaining open at depth.  
 
A variety of hydrothermal mineralisation styles are present at 309. On surface, sinter crops out along an 
arcuate trend that rings near surface gold mineralisation. The complex shape of the 309 ore body is the 
result of both structural controls on fluid flow and hydrothermal processes. 
 
 At depth gold mineralisation is predominantly focused along WNW and, to a lesser extent, NNE structural 
zones as stockwork veins and breccia fill. The best grades form in two 50 -70 m high layers broadly sub-
parallel to bedding and presumably the palaeo surface.  
 
The uppermost of the two zones contains abundant bladed fluorite-chalcedony-quartz veins and breccia 
fill. GBM interprets this zone to represent a boiling and / or fluid mixing zone with associated abundant 
silicification potentially having formed a cap that allowed later gold rich fluids to be concentrated.
