# Sienna Resources Inc. Increases Size of "Elko Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 10, 2024) - Sienna Resources Inc. (TSXV: SIE) (OTC Pink: SNNAF) (FSE: A1XCQ0) ("Sienna" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has increased its acreage for a total of 1,839 contiguous acres on its "Elko Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. This project is directly bordering Surge Battery Metals' (NILI) "Nevada North Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. According to the news dated September 12, 2023 from Surge, "The first certified analytical results for the 2023 summer drilling program at Surge Battery Metals Inc.'s Nevada North lithium project (NNLP) have returned multiple zones of high values ranging from 1,000 parts per million to 8,070 ppm lithium, the highest grades for exploration to date on the Nevada North Lithium Project." Sienna management cautions that past results or discoveries on properties in proximity to Sienna may not necessarily be indicative of the presence of mineralization on the company's properties. The Company also wishes to announce an update regarding the first phase of drilling in Nevada. The initial drill program was moved forward quickly in hopes to beat the weather. This part of Nevada is difficult to work in during the winter and the location was chosen primarily due to ease of location for equipment access. The drill was planning to reach 1,000 feet as the location was a little higher up topographically than the formation in the valley below. The hole was only able to get to 450 feet due to weather, therefore it didn't test the full depth of the planned hole during this phase. The assays from the one hole drilled did not return economic grades of lithium. A follow up plan is being formulate now with this new data in hand.

Jason Gigliotti, President of Sienna, states, "With the spring and summer work season upcoming, we are formulating plans to expand the work program on this project and have sufficient cash on hand to do this. We are also expecting to be active in Clayton Valley as well."

About Sienna Resources Inc.

Sienna has recently acquired the "Elko Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. This project consists of approximately 1200 contiguous acres directly bordering Surge Battery Metals' (NILI) "Nevada North Lithium Project" in Elko County, Nevada. Sienna is also one of the larger landholders in Clayton Valley Nevada. Sienna's Clayton Valley projects include the Blue Clay Lithium Project, the Silver Peak South Project, and the Clayton Valley Deep Basin Lithium Project. Clayton Valley is home to the only lithium production in North America, being Albemarle Corp's Silver Peak deposit. This project is also near Tesla Motors Inc.'s Gigafactory in Nevada. On March 18, 2021, Schlumberger New Energy Venture announced the development of a lithium extraction pilot plant through its new venture, NeoLith Energy in a strategic partnership with Pure Energy. The deployment of the pilot plant will be in Clayton Valley, Nevada, USA. The NeoLith Energy sustainable approach uses a differentiated direct lithium extraction (DLE) process to enable the production of high-purity, battery-grade lithium material while reducing the production time from over a year to weeks. Results from this pilot plant are expected in 2023 and could have a significant impact on the brine prospects within Clayton Valley Nevada as Sienna is located in the deepest section of this brine deposit. One other project Sienna has is the 'Marathon North Platinum-Palladium Property' in Northern Ontario directly bordering Generation Mining Marathon Deposit.
