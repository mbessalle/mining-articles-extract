    "description": "<p><strong>GURNEE, IL / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2023 /</strong> BrightRock Gold Corp. (OTC PINK:BRGC) is pleased to announce an additional 20% expansion of its existing footprint at the Midnight Owl Lithium Project. Approximately 4,900 acres are now divided between 237 lode claims, each with full ownership rights. As a reference to this most recent expansion, new maps are attached. This expansion was planned immediately following the results of 10-meter satellite imaging carried out by Dirt Exploration (<a href=\"https://pr.report/TzCQuB0c\">see 8/8/2023 Update</a>). Mr. Steven Cyros, our Head of Exploration, worked tirelessly to see this project through to completion.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:787px;display:table;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/774425/image.jpeg\" alt=\"BrightRock Gold Corp, Wednesday, August 16, 2023, Press release picture\"></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><p> </p><p> </p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:801px;display:table;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/774425/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"BrightRock Gold Corp, Wednesday, August 16, 2023, Press release picture\"></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dirt Exploration's spectral correlation of prospective lithium minerals on the surface served as a crucial blueprint for validating and completing this expansion project.
