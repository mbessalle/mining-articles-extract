GREENVALE ADDS FOURTH HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE NT
URANIUM PROJECT TO ITS GROWING ENERGY PORTFOLIO
The new Elkedra Uranium Project sits within Cambrian Georgina Basin metasediments in
the NT and is prospective for sandstone-hosted and unconformity style uranium deposits
Highlights:
• Greenvale enters into a binding Heads of Agreement with Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd
to acquire an initial 80% interest in the Elkedra Uranium Project, located 300km
north-east of Alice Springs and 200km south-east of Tennant Creek.
• Elkedra comprises one large Exploration Licence, EL33756, encompassing an
area of 566km2.
• The Project is highly prospective for sandstone-hosted and unconformity type
uranium mineralisation, with an extensive U/Th ratio and coincident uranium
anomaly occurring over an 8km strike length.
• The anomaly is located immediately south-east of the fertile metamorphosed
halo of the Elkedra granite.
• The Elkedra Project represents a complementary addition to Greenvale’s
energy portfolio following its recent acquisition of the Douglas, Tobermorey
and Henbury Uranium Projects, all located within the NT.
• The Elkedra Project contains multiple shallow walk-up drill targets, offering the
potential for cost-effective exploration using shallow drilling methods.
Greenvale Energy Limited (ASX: GRV, “Greenvale” or “the Company”) is pleased to
announce the acquisition of a highly prospective new uranium project in the Northern
Territory which offers outstanding exploration potential for sandstone-hosted and
unconformity type uranium discoveries.
Greenvale has entered into an acquisition agreement with Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd over
EL33756 (Figure 1), comprising the Elkedra Uranium Project, which is located 300km
north-east of Alice Springs and 200km south-east of Tennant Creek in the south-west
Georgina Basin region of the Northern Territory.
The acquisition further strengthens Greenvale’s growing Australian uranium portfolio,
complementing its recent acquisitions of the Douglas, Tobermorey and Henbury uranium
projects. All four projects contain walk-up drill targets and offer the opportunity to utilise
shallow, cost-effective exploration methods.

Greenvale has secured the rights to acquire an immediate 80% interest in the Exploration
Licence, with the original project owners, Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd, being free-carried through
to a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). Greenvale has incurred a small upfront cost of
approximately $10,000 payable to Gempart as reimbursement of data acquisition costs to
secure its 80% Interest in the tenements.
Management Comment
Greenvale CEO, Mark Turner, said: “We are delighted to have secured the acquisition of
another high-potential uranium asset. The Elkedra Project represents another significant
addition to our growing Australian energy portfolio, complementing the recently acquired
Douglas, Tobermorey and Henbury Projects.
“The Elkedra Project has proven prospectivity for large-scale sandstone-hosted uranium
deposits in an attractive geological setting and comes with multiple high-priority exploration
targets. Elkedra is also prospective for unconformity type uranium mineralisation.
“Importantly, the nature of the mineralisation means we can explore using cost-effective
shallow air-core drilling techniques, making this a project that is easy to access and explore
– allowing us to advance it rapidly. We are looking forward to getting on the ground and
commencing exploration activity as soon as possible.”
The Project
The Elkedra Project area occupies an area of 566km in the Barkly region of the Northern
Territory. The region has a semi-arid, tropical climate with average rainfall of 350mm
during the summer period from November to March. The exploration field season
traditionally occurs from late March to mid-November.

A 400m line spaced airborne magnetics/radiometric survey completed by the NTGS (in
1999) has defined multiple uranium and Uranium/Thorium ratio anomalies (see Figures 3
and 4) which extend continuously over a strike length of approximately 8km.
The surface rocks comprise Cambrian grey black siltstones of the Arthur Creek Formation
which are calcareous, carbonaceous, phosphatic and pyritic at depth. Andagera
Formation quartz sandstones are also present within the Project area.
The Cambrian sediments unconformably overlie early Proterozoic Hatches Creek Group
rocks consisting of shallow water sandstones, siltstones and various thicknesses of felsic
and mafic volcanics.
The Hatches Creek Group was intruded by the Elkedra granite around 1660 Ma. The
Elkedra granite is a medium to coarse grained biotite granite with minor tonalite. There is
a ca 100m metamorphic aureole surrounding the granite, which is interpreted to be the
source of anomalous uranium and thorium identified in the 1999 magnetic/radiometric
survey.
It is yet to be determined if the anomalous U/Thorium mineralisation occurs within the
Cambrian sediments or within the unconformable interface between the Cambrian and
early Proterozoic rocks.

Previous Exploration
NTGS databases “Historical Mineral Titles” and “GEMIS” were interrogated to capture past
exploration titles overlapping EL33756, and all relevant reports were reviewed. Where
relevant, sample sites were digitised and assay results transcribed from older reports.
Table 1 below is a summary of the historical titles and results reported. Plans summarising
previous surface sample sites and drill-holes are provided in Figures 3 & 4.
There has been no historical field exploration over the anomalous uranium and
Uranium/Thorium ratio area. Most of the historical work conducted within EL33756 was in
the northern part of the tenement and focused on the outcropping Hatches Creek Group
rocks.
