VANCOUVER, BC / TheNewswire / May 8th, 2024 – Element79 Gold Corp.

Highlights

  * Since Acquisition in 2021, the Company has worked to advance the project, including an updated 43-101 compliant inferred resource of 3.71Mozi AuEq. 

  * In seeking funding partners for the development of the Maverick Springs project, management negotiated and subsequently engaged with Sun Silver in August 2023 via a Binding Option Agreement.   

  * As the Company is now focused on advancing the high-grade Lucero Project with near term production potential in Peru, this transaction allows realizing enhanced value for Mavericks Springs from an adjusted CAD $3.337M acquisition and carrying cost to a final sale value of CAD $5.033M an increase in value of $1,696M, or 51% ROI within 28 months. 

  * Sale proceeds will generate a total of CAD $4,400,000 cash and 3,500,000 ordinary shares in Sun Silver priced at AUD$0.20 (fair market value AUD $700,000.) which are expected to be listed Australian Stock Exchange (“the ASX”) on or around May 15, 2024.  

  * CAD $2,200,000 of cash sale proceeds will be used to pay out the loan associated with the Waterton Contingent Value Rights Agreement 

  * Remaining funds will fuel development of other corporate projects, operations and reduce both capital debt and accounts payable.
