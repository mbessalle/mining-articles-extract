Sun Silver Limited (ASX Code: “SS1”) (“Sun Silver” or “the Company") is pleased to advise that it has staked an additional 80 lode claims within the Maverick Springs North area, further enhancing its globally significant Maverick Springs Silver-Gold Project in Nevada, USA.

The strategic expansion follows the Company's recent drilling success, where outstanding results trending to the north have prompted the Company to expand its landholding along strike from the mineralised zone.

The newly staked claims represent a 34% increase in total land holding at the Project, allowing for further exploration and development opportunities. This expansion not only enhances the potential to discover additional silver and gold mineralisation, but also provides additional space for potential future development infrastructure.

**Sun Silver Executive Director, Gerard O'Donovan, said:**
> “We are pleased to announce the staking of an additional 80 lode claims at Maverick Springs North, which marks another important step in our growth strategy.
>
> “This land acquisition is crucial as it not only expands our exploration footprint along strike but also provide additional optionality for any potential future development infrastructure.
>
> “Our recent success with the drill bit has reinforced our belief in the Project's enormous potential, and this strategic expansion ensures we can fully capitalise on the opportunities ahead.”

The total cost for staking was a nominal US$34,000, reflecting the Company's commitment to maximising shareholder value while maintaining a prudent approach to expenditure.
