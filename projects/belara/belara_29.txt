THE KALAHARI COPPER BELT PROJECT
Project Introduction
The Kalahari Copper Belt Project (KCP or Project ) is situated within northern Botswana’s prolific Kalahari
Copper Belt. The Project consists of fourteen exploration licenses covering 4,268km2 of highly prospective
geology known to host several world-class, sediment-hosted copper-silver deposits, most notably the
producing operations, Motheo Mine and Boseto Mine, owned by Sandfire Resources and Khoemacau
respectively. Of particular interest is the Khoemacau operation with its satellite deposits as these are located
30km along strike from project licenses. (Mineralisation on adjacent projects does not necessarily replicate
similar mineralisation on the projects being reported on) (Endeavour Scientific (Pty) Ltd, 2024).
The Project is located in a geological setting with the potential to host significant deposits of copper and silver,
both low-risk, stable commodities with significant growth potential. Belararox has devised a cost-effective
exploration strategy that aims to rapidly reduce the search space with regional geophysics programs and
subsequent validation drilling.
Project History
Previous Ownership and Exploration
Exploration has been carried out on the Kalahari Copper Belt in Botswana by a number of companies since the
1960s. Most of the historical work has focussed on the Lake Ngami region and in the vicinity of the Ghanzi
Ridge, where the sequence is exposed or under a relatively thin Kalahari cover. The region around Maun is
mostly covered by Kalahari sands and is underlain by a dense system of Karoo dykes which have complicated
magnetic interpretations of the target stratigraphy. As a result, this part of the KCB has seen little to no modern
exploration.
The area presently covered by PL2256/2022 was previously held by Virgo Resources Ltd (Virgo) under previous
licence PL002/2018 as part of an extensive land package. Prior to Virgo’s involvement, there appears to be no
information regarding historic exploration on the licence. No information has been identified on exploration
activities carried out by Virgo on the licence.

Technical Summary
Regional Geology
The Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic Ghanzi-Chobe belt is situated along the northern margin of the Kalahari
Craton and extends NE-SW for ~500 km across northern Botswana (Modie, 1996). The Ghanzi-Chobe Belt
overlies the Paleoproterozoic basement of the Okwa Terrane (Ramokate et al., 2000) and broadly consists of
two stacked basin assemblages that were subsequently inverted and tightly folded. At the base of the
Mesoproterozoic stratigraphy and unconformably overlying the Okwa Terrane is the Kgwebe Volcanic Complex,
which consists of a bimodal suite of within-plate continental tholeiite and post-collisional high-K rhyolite
(Kampunzu et al., 1998). These rocks were interpreted to have been deposited within a continental rift basin,
referred to as the Botswana Rift Basin, which initially developed in response to orogenic collapse and extension
during the final stages of the Mesoproterozoic Kibaran Orogeny (Kampunzu et al., 1998; Ramokate et al., 2000).
The Meso-Neoproterozoic Ghanzi Group unconformably overlies the bimodal Khwebe Volcanics, and broadly
consists of a 5-10km thick sequence of siliciclastics and carbonaceous sediments deposited during a period of
renewed extension (Hall et al., 2018; Modie, 1996; Modie, 2000).

Stratigraphy of the Ghanzi Group
In stratigraphic order, the Ghanzi Group comprises the Kuke Formation, Ngwako Pan Formation, the D’Kar
Formation, and the Mamuno Formation, which collectively record marine transgression, and an unconformable
transition from alluvial, to shallow-marine depositional environments, and back again (Hall et al., 2018;
Lehmann et al., 2015). The Kuke Formation consists of a ~500m thick package of bedded conglomerates and
sandstones, with the basal layers containing clasts of the underlying Kwebge Volcanics. The Kuke Formation is
conformably overlain by the ~2000m thick Ngwako-Pan Formation, which is dominated by bedded sandstone
with subordinate intercalations of mudstone. This unit becomes progressively oxidized towards the top of the
sequence before it is truncated by an erosional unconformity. Sitting at the top of the unconformity are reduced
sediments of the lowermost D’Kar Formation, which consists of laminated siltstone, arkosic sediments,
subordinate carbonate layers and black shale. This reduced sequence conformably transitions to more oxidized
compositions of arkosic sediments, siltstone and minor carbonate layers. Finally, the D’Kar Formation is
conformably overlain by the ~1500m thick Mamuno Formation, which consists of oxidized, cross-bedded to
wave rippled sandstone and siltstone, with minor mudstone and limestone (Lehmann et al., 2015; Modie,
2000). The Ghanzi Group has been unconformably overlain by Phanerozoic sequences of the Karoo Supergroup
(Franchi et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 1996) and Kalahari Group (Haddon and McCarthy, 2005) , which cover
much of southern Africa and largely conceal exposures of the Ghanzi Group (Modie, 1996).
Figure 3: Compilation figure illustrating the local geological setting of the Kalahari Copper Belt Project (Hall et al., 2021). Note the
association between deposit locations and the lithological contact between the Ngwako-Pan Fm and D’Kar Formation. The stratigraphic
column is presented on the right.
The Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic stratigraphy of the Botswana Basin (Kwebge Volcanics and Ghanzi Group)
has been inverted and deformed during the events of the Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic Pan-African Orogeny (Fritz
et al., 2013; Rino et al., 2008). The Pan-African Orogeny has been locally recorded within the Damara Orogen
(Gray et al., 2008), a Paleozoic mobile belt which recorded continent-continent collision between the Kalahari
Craton and Congo Cratons (Foster et al., 2015). The collision of these two terranes imparted a bi-vergent fold
and thrust belt (Goscombe et al., 2020), which, along the northwestern margin of the Kalahari Craton, resulted
in southeastwards verging folding and thrusting of the inboard Ghanzi-Chobe Belt (Modie, 2000).

Mineralisation
The Ghanzi-Chobe Belt contributes to the larger Kalahari Copper Belt, extending for >800 Km from Namibia
through northwestern Botswana. The Kalahari Copper Belt contains world-class, sediment-hosted Cu-Ag camps
such as the Khoemecau cluster, which consists of several deposits, including Zone 5 and Boseto (Kelepile, Betsi,
& Shemang, 2020). Mineral systems within the Kalahari Copper Belt conform to the “Red-bed” sediment-
hosted – Cu deposit classification of Cox et al. (2007). Deposits are generally strata-bound and structurally
controlled, with mineralisation always occurring at the redox interface along the unconformity which divides
the D’kar Formation and Ngwako Pan Formation. Mineralisation at this interface is typically zoned from
oxidised, high sulphidation-state sulphides at the redox front (chalcocite-bornite) to more reduced species
distally (chalcopyrite-pyrite) (Sillitoe et al., 2010). Mineralising fluids are thought to have been derived from
basement volcanics and sediments, liberated during basin inversion associated with the Pan-African Orogeny.
These oxidised, metalliferous fluids coalesced and migrated through the stratigraphy along basement faults,
scavenging metals before ore deposition at the redox front. Mineralisation is typically concentrated within
dilational sites such as along antiformal fold hinges, shear zones, and zones of interlimb slip and parasitic
folding.
Several key vectors to mineralisation have been identified to assist in exploring sediment-hosted Cu deposits
within the KCB. They include:
• The Kwebge Volcanics, interpreted as the source rocks for the metalliferous fluids.
• Preservation of the Ngwako Pan Fm – D’Kar Fm contact.
• Fluid conduits to facilitate the transportation of metalliferous fluids through the overlying stratigraphy
and towards suitable trap sites.
• Dilational sites and ore traps, such as antiformal fold hinges, within proximity to basement faults, for
concentration of mineralising fluids and ore deposition.
NEXT STEPS
The following exploration workflow, outlined by Belararox, is designed to rapidly develop the Kalahari Copper
Belt Project towards the goal of discovery.
• Airborne gravity survey and gravity profile inversion modelling across the tenement package. 500m
spacing for high-priority licenses and 1,000m across lower priority. The airborne gravity survey will aim
to elucidate the regional-scale structural and stratigraphic architecture, emphasising the location of
basement highs and basement structures relative to preserved NPF-DF contacts and regional
antiformal structures. Rapid reduction in the search space will enable satisfaction of tenement
relinquishment requirements.
• 2D Seismic survey. Prospective settings defined by the gravity survey and inversion modelling to be
followed up with 2D seismic surveys. The seismic survey will aim to increase the resolution and
confidence of the stratigraphy and local structure.
• RAB or aircore drilling. Early-stage RAB or air-core drill program to validate geophysical interpretations,
including interpreted stratigraphic position and depth to basement. Downhole sampling to also provide
a geochemical dataset for further target delineation, which will be particularly useful within areas of
post-mineral cover. Downhole petrophysical datasets can be acquired to better model geophysical
data.
• Induced Polarisation (IP) survey. Close-spaced IP program across prospective stratigraphic and
structural targets verified by RAB or aircore drilling.
• Targeted RC and/or DD drilling program. Drilling of strong chargeability anomalies positioned at the
NPF-DF contact and within favourable structural settings.
