# West Point Gold Expands Gold Chain Land Package by 30%

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 19, 2025) - West Point Gold, (TSXV: WPG) (OTCQB: WPGCF) (FSE: LRA0) ("West Point Gold" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has staked an additional 113 lode claims on Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") land at its Gold Chain Project in Arizona. The Gold Chain project now consists of 492 lode claims on BLM land covering 9,840 acres (3,982 hectares) and 15 patented claims, covering a total of 282 acres (114 hectares). The new claims expand the Gold Chain project to the northwest along the regionally important Union Pass Fault where it merges with the Frisco Mine Fault which forms the southwest limit of the Frisco Graben (Figure 1).

_"This expanded area adds additional large-scale targets at Gold Chain. While our near-term focus remains on the Tyro Main Zone, we plan to continue advancing the many targets on the project to determine the scale potential of Gold Chain,"_ stated Quentin Mai, CEO, _"The highest priority targets are the Tyro Extensions to the South (Sunset and Sunrise Veins) and the Frisco Graben to the North, which are expected to be the next targets drilled."_

**New Claims Added on the Northwest of Gold Chain  
** These new claims (Figure 1) mostly cover the northwest extension of a major NNW-trending structural corridor which hosts numerous rhyolite flow domes, rhyolite dikes, local volcanic centers and several underexplored gold occurrences in the Black Mountain range. This structural corridor, referred to as the Union Pass fault, is a broad zone of parallel structures including the Frisco Mine fault which is the primary target at the Company's Frisco Graben target. In brief, this fault zone defines the northern boundary of the Katherine Horst where Miocene volcanic rocks have been offset and juxtaposed onto Precambrian rocks (Figure 1). The corridor has been invaded by rhyolite dikes and subsequently mineralized by several quartz events including up to three stages of gold bearing quartz events. Preliminary mapping and sampling have revealed broad zones of quartz veining in the Precambrian rocks and local hydrothermal breccia bodies. The mineralized zone has been roughly defined over 7 kilometres where it disappears under Quaternary gravel to the west. Numerous pits and small shafts (<20m) have been identified and testify to the presence of gold mineralization. Previous sampling has returned up to 2.07 g/t Au.

The inclusion of this highly prospective structural corridor into the Company's exploration portfolio provides a very accessible, likely shallow target. Next steps include mapping and sampling of the quartz veining and breccia bodies to better define near-term targets.
