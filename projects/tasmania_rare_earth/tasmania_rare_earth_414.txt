About the Tasmanian Rare Earths Projects
The Project is hosted in highly sought rare earth-rich ionic adsorption clay hosted deposits comprising
Jurassic Dolerites and Basalts and provide significant upside potential for economic rare earth
magnet metals.
Globally, most rare-earths are sourced from hard-rock mines. These typically require large, costly
processing plants and a significant lead time to reach production. A less common source of rare
earths is ionic adsorption clay (IAC) deposits. Historically, these have only been mined in southern
China. A major advantage of IAC deposits is that the rare earths can be extracted from the clay via a
simple leaching process. Secondly, they often exist at shallow depth. These advantages enable a
project to be developed rapidly and at lower cost. Furthermore, IAC deposits are relatively richer in Project Summary Com
the rare earths needed for permanent magnets, and they typically contain low concentrations of
radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium.
Meryllion CEO Richard Revelins commented: "Prices of the super-magnet rare-earth elements are
rising strongly due to a significant shortage of supply and buying by the major consumers and
governments. China currently controls over 80% of global REE supply but is not expanding
production at the same rate that demand for the critical REEs is rising. Accordingly, this is a highly

prospective acquisition opportunity in an area where prices are responding favorably to international
demand."
