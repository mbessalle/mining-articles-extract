earths is ionic adsorption clay (IAC) deposits. Historically, these have only been mined in southern
China. A major advantage of IAC deposits is that the rare earths can be extracted from the clay via a
simple leaching process, recoveries of up to 70% have been achieved utilizing a benign,
environmentally friendly ammonium sulphate leach. Secondly, these deposits generally exist at, or
close to surface. These advantages enable a project to be developed rapidly and at lower cost than
traditional hard rock deposits. Furthermore, IAC deposits are relatively richer in the rare earths
needed for permanent magnets, and they typically contain low concentrations of radioactive
elements such as uranium and thorium, making permitting and treatment significantly less complex.
