An OBA allows for special consideration to bring significant projects into production. This approval demonstrates the Government of Utah’s support for the development of the Green River project. This OBA lease increases the Green River land package abutting the Company's privately owned land parcel and the proposed Processing plant location. E 3 5% qT % ST a med] i 175%m.

Commenting on the OBA grant Executive Chairman and CEO Bruce Richardson said, “The decision to grant the 27.05 km? of mineral salt rights around the Companies privately owned land for the extraction brine to produce lithium by the Government of Utah further demonstrates its support for the Green River Lithium Project. In recent weeks we have seen the grant of the Underground Injection Control (UIC) permit and the confirmation of the Water (Brine) Extraction permit for the project as well as support earlier this year for the drilling program at Bosydaba#1 well. The Green River Lithium Project is progressing at an exceptional rate towards production.” Green River Lithium Project - Exploration Target An Exploration Target, based on the data derived from the drilling of the Bosydaba #1 well, was upgraded for the area surrounding well, see ASX Announcement 15 February 2023, and with the new OBA lease addition, an area now totaling 1,192 hectares (11.92km?). The area includes some of the northern claims of the Green River Lithium Project, see Figure 2. At the Green River Lithium Project, the targeted supersaturated brine units have no recorded historical lithium assays. However, these brines have been previously intercepted during historical oil and gas drilling. As a result, the Green River Lithium Project is classified as an Exploration Target. The Exploration Target for the Mississippian Leadville units have a range of 1.1 billion tons to 1.6 billion tons of brine, grading 100 — 150ppm Li, see Table 1.",
