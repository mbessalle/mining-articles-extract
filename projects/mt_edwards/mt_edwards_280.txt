WIN Metals Limited (ASX: WIN) (WIN) together with Auric Mining Ltd (ASX: AWJ) (Auric) are pleased to 
announce that the two parties have successfully settled and completed the partial purchase by Auric of WIN’s 
nickel, lithium and other associated metal rights within the Munda Gold Project and other assets. (See ASX 
announcement of 23 July 2024) 
The Munda tenement, M15/87, is a granted mining lease which contains the Munda Gold Project. 
Auric now has exclusive rights to mine within the Auric Rights Area (See Fig 1) for a period of 8 years and 
ongoing mining rights beyond that date.  
Auric now owns all minerals to a depth of 235m RL, or 150m in depth, within Auric’s Rights Area. 
 
Win Metals Managing Director and CEO, Mr Steve Norregaard, commented: 
“This is a good logical deal for both parties. Auric get a clean run to exploit their gold resource without the 
complication of dealing with a third party and WIN secure some funding without relinquishing the lions share 
of the Munda nickel resource… a WIN WIN”.
