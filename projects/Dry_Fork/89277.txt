Vancouver, BC – February 26, 2025 – URZ3 Energy Corp. ("URZ3" or the “Company”) (TSXV: URZ; OTCQB: URZEF) is pleased to announce that it has staked mineral claims in the uranium rich Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The claims, which cover approximately 890 acres, are situated in the well established in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium district west of the Christensen Ranch (Uranium Energy Corp.) and Nichols Ranch (Energy Fuels Inc.) ISR mines. The claims comprise the Company’s Dry Fork Project and are believed to host favorable geological structures suggesting prospectivity for uranium exploration. 

The Powder River Basin has long been recognized as one of North America’s key ISR uranium districts, and URZ3's latest staking represents a significant step in the Company’s strategy to expand its uranium portfolio. The proximity to the proven Christensen Ranch and Nichols Ranch ISR mines further reinforces the potential of the area and the exploration upside of the Dry Fork Project. 

Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO, commented, “This new project allows URZ3 Energy Corp. to leverage its experienced team and proven exploration expertise to try to replicate the success many of the Company’s founders and principals (those formerly with Uranerz Energy Corp.) achieved at the Nichols Ranch project prior to Uranerz being acquired in 2015 by Energy Fuels. The favorable geological setting of this newly staked project, combined with the district’s reputation for high-quality ISR uranium resources, provides an exciting opportunity to build another successful uranium project.” 

The Powder River Basin’s extensive uranium mineralization, combined with the growing demand for clean energy, presents a compelling opportunity for investors interested in North American, and specifically United States, uranium resource exploration and development. URZ3 Energy Corp. is formulating plans to advance its uranium exploration activities. 

The claims were staked and filed with the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) in October and November, 2024, respectively and are subject to final adjudication by the BLM.
