**Commenting on the acquisition, Eagle Mountain Mining's CEO, Tim Mason, said:**
> “The completion of the Cochise claim acquisition marks a key milestone for Eagle Mountain. We have now acquired the last privately held property between our tailings storage facility and the Oracle Ridge mine. Cochise is important for access and infrastructure between the Oracle Ridge mine and the tailings facility, along with valuable water rights. We are confident this acquisition will have a positive impact on the long-term success and sustainability of the Wedgetail Project.”

Eagle Mountain Mining Limited (ASX: EM2) (Eagle Mountain, or the Company) is pleased to provide an update on the Company's 100% owned Wedgetail Project (Wedgetail, or the Project) in Arizona, USA.

In February 2024, the Company exercised a first right of refusal to acquire the approximately 15 acres of the Cochise patented claim adjacent to existing patented claims owned by the Company. The acquisition is for 100% of the surface rights (refer to ASX announcement dated 28 February 2024).

The acquisition terms are US$325,000 comprising a down payment of US$200,000 and a secured seller's loan of US$125,000 over a 5-year period at 6% interest per year, with monthly repayments. The purchase of Cochise avoids approximately US$190,000 of further lease payments which were payable under the lease agreement with the vendor.

The Company has now finalised the legal agreements, transferred the down payment and received the legal title for the Cochise patented claim.

The Company does not have mineral rights to Cochise at this time, however exploration activities are currently being planned to broaden the understanding of OREX and Golden Eagle targets. Furthermore, Cochise hosts the Sanderson gold mine which shares similar geology to nearby claims. The Sanderson mine operated as an underground operation between 1936 and 1941².

This ASX announcement was authorised for release by the Board of Eagle Mountain Mining Limited.
