    "description": "ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 23 DECEMBER 2024 EAGLE MOUNTAIN MINING Acquisition of Strategic Patented Claim Completed Highlights « Eagle Mountain has successfully completed the acquisition of a strategic land package at Wedgetail Project in Arizona USA. « The Cochise private patented claim lies between the Oracle Ridge mine and tailings storage facility. «Cochise provides strategic access and infrastructure between the Oracle Ridge mine’ and the tailings facility, along with valuable water rights. «The Company has paid US$200,000 to complete the acquisition, and title for the property has been transferred to Wedgetail Operations LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle Mountain. Commenting on the acquisition, Eagle Mountain Mining's CEO, Tim Mason, said: “The completion of the Cochise claim acquisition marks a key milestone for Eagle Mountain. We have now acquired the last privately held property between our tailings storage facility and the Oracle Ridge mine. Cochise is important for access and infrastructure between the Oracle Ridge mine and the tailings facility, along with valuable water rights. We are confident this acquisition will have a positive impact on the long-term success and sustainability of the Wedgetail Project.” Eagle Mountain Mining Limited (ASX: EM2) (Eagle Mountain, or the Company) is pleased to provide an update on the Company's 100% owned Wedgetail Project (Wedgetail, or the Project) in Arizona, USA. In February 2024, the Company exercised a first right of refusal to acquire the approximately 15 acres of the Cochise patented claim adjacent to existing patented claims owned by the Company. The acquisition is for 100% of the surface rights (refer to ASX announcement dated 28 February 2024). The acquisition terms are US$325,000 comprising a down payment of US$200,000 and a secured seller's loan of US$125,000 over a 5-year period at 6% interest per year, with monthly repayments. The purchase of Cochise avoids approximately US$190,000 of further lease payments which were payable under the lease agreement with the vendor. 1 The Oracle Ridge Mine is subject to a reversion right, and the Company has provided notice that it will not exercise its option to extend ownership of the mineral rights upon which the mine is located.
