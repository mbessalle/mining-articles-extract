# Fairchild Gold Corp Announces Successful Completion of Transaction with Koba Resources Ltd.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 14, 2025) - Fairchild Gold Corp (**TSXV: FAIR**) ("**Fairchild** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that its previously announced transaction disclosed on February 11, 2025, with Koba Resources Ltd. ("**Koba** "), has successfully completed on March 12, 2025.

_**Strategic Acquisition Completed**_

Having secured all necessary approvals and with all conditions satisfied, the Company's transaction with Koba has been completed. Fairchild has begun the process of integrating the extensive database received through this acquisition, which includes thousands of rock and soil samples as well as geophysical surveys.

"This is a significant acquisition for Fairchild," said Luis Martins, Chief Executive Officer of Fairchild Gold Corp. "The completion of this transaction represents an important milestone in our growth strategy and positions us as the dominant claim holder in the historic Goodsprings mining district. The acquired database which covers most of our enlarged and consolidated claim package will allow the company to collapse the timeframe it originally anticipated would be required prior to drilling."

_**Expanded Land Position**_

With the completion of this transaction, Fairchild's Copper Chief Project now covers a total of 300+ claims, spanning approximately 6150 acres in the Goodsprings mining district of Nevada. This substantial land package consolidates a significant portion of this historically productive region.

 _**DATA PACKAGE**_

Fairchild Gold received a substantial package of historical geological, geochemical, and geophysical data from Koba Resources that were summarized in an analyst's publicly disclosed report by Ian Spence of Peloton Capital Pty Ltd. dated June 7, 2022. These data were originally acquired from work conducted by Koba's predecessor company New World Resources, starting in 2019. This work was conducted by geologists and geophysicists who were qualified persons as defined by Instrument NI 43-101, and Fairchild Gold is confident that this historical work and these historical data and descriptive maps and interpretive summaries are of high quality and are an accurate representation of the work conducted by Koba and New World Resources.

**Historic Goodsprings Data Highlights:**

  * **1361 Rock samples** and**2653 Soil samples**

  * **Copper Assays** : up to _**25% Copper**_ in multiple locations. Confirming _**Copperside Mine**_ anomaly. (Sample PS0014) Top 25 sample average _**13.7 %**_

  * _**Gold Assays:**_ Up to _**151 g/t**_ (sample 2645) Top 25 sample average _**18.11 ppm**_

These data will be carefully analysed and, in some cases, reprocessed, giving a much more robust basis for preparation of the next exploration steps. Updates will be coming soon.

_**Next Phases of Exploration**_

  1.  _Comprehensive review and integration of the newly acquired database_
  2.  _Detailed geological mapping and innovative geophysical surveys to rank numerous high-priority targets already identified_
  3.  _Targeted drill program_



 _"We are extremely excited about the potential of the Copper Chief Project and the broader Goodsprings district, The historical production in this area only scratched the surface. Modern exploration techniques, combined with our large, consolidated land position and comprehensive database, give us a unique opportunity to unlock substantial value for our shareholders." -Luis Martins (CEO)._

**The Company believes the Goodsprings district has the potential to host a large-scale, district-wide mineral system with multiple deposit types, including:**

  * _High-grade copper-lead-zinc carbonate replacement deposits_

  *  _Structurally controlled precious and PGE metal veins_

  *  _Potential for porphyry copper-gold-related mineralization_




Fairchild's strategic position in this historically productive yet underexplored district represents a compelling opportunity to make significant discoveries using modern exploration techniques.
