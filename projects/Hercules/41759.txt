# Hercules Silver Enters into Lease Option Agreement for Copper-Gold Porphyry Target in Hercules Mining District

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - October 2, 2023) - **Hercules Silver Corp.**  (**TSXV: BIG**) (**OTCQB: BADEF**) (**FSE: 8Q7**) ("**Hercules Silver** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce it has entered into a lease option agreement (the "**Agreement** ") between the Company, Anglo-Bomarc, U.S., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "**Lessee** ") and local prospector Merrill Palmer (the "**Lessor** "), dated September 27, 2023, which grants Hercules Silver the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Mineral property, comprising eighty-seven (87) unpatented lode mining claims within the Mineral mining district ("**Mineral** " or the "**Property** ") located on Bureau of Land Management ("**BLM** ") administered lands, 14 miles southwest of the Company's flagship Hercules property in Washington County, Idaho.

Chris Paul, CEO and Director of the Company, noted: "_We've entered into a lease option agreement to secure another key piece of ground in the Hercules mining district, which the Company believes shows strong potential to emerge into a significant copper porphyry belt. The Hercules Copper Belt, as it's referred to internally, represents a trend of underexplored copper porphyry targets with excellent discovery potential. Relative to Hercules, the Mineral Project appears to be the next best developed prospect in the district and adds another compelling copper-gold porphyry target to the portfolio. We are highly encouraged by Mineral's historical drilling, strong soil geochemistry and similar geological setting to the Hercules project."_

**About the Mineral Property:**

The Mineral Property was staked by renowned prospector, Merrill Palmer, who previously staked and discovered the Palmer VMS Project in Alaska. Mr. Palmer resides in the nearby town of Oxbow, Oregon, and has been prospecting the Hercules and Mineral mining districts for the past 15 years, including staking of the Mineral Property in 2011.

The Mineral mining district was so-named after prospectors discovered rhyolite-hosted silver-copper-lead-zinc-bearing replacement mineralization in the area during the 1870s. A town site was established, and small-scale mining began in the 1880s and continued in earnest until the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act by U.S. President Cleveland in 1893, which caused a collapse in the silver price and decimated the silver mining industry. The mines and smelters at Mineral shut down at that time, and subsequent mining was very sporadic and conducted at a small scale through to 1950. The district has been essentially dormant ever since, apart from a few years of historical exploration during the late 1960s/early 1970s, but has never had a modern, systematic exploration approach applied to it. 

Cyprus Mines Corporation ("**Cyprus** ") acquired a position in the district in 1968, after reconnaissance work indicated the presence of two potential deposit types: rhyolite-hosted, replacement-style silver-copper-lead-zinc mineralization on the southern half of the Property (similar in nature to the near-surface mineralization style that occurs at Hercules) and porphyry copper-gold style mineralization, hosted in potassium-rich dioritic intrusive rocks which underlie the rhyolite and outcrop on the northern half of the Property. 

Cyprus carried out exploration activities between April of 1968 and February of 1970, consisting of geological mapping, geochemical soil surveys, a 17 line-mile IP-resistivity geophysical survey, and a 40-hole program of reverse circulation, churn, and core drilling. Cyprus's exploration efforts were focused on near-surface silver mineralization, amenable to bulk mining methods. Although they intersected narrow, high-grade silver-bearing structures - including up to 7 meters grading 701 g/t Ag and 3.5% Cu in MDD-4[1],2 a hole drilled between the historical Boone and Enterprise mines, on an inlying (adjacent) patented mining claim currently held by a 3rd party - they terminated the program without evaluating the copper-gold porphyry potential in the underlying and adjacent intrusive rocks which outcrop on the northern half of the Property. Merrill Palmer has provided the Company with significant exploration data from these historical exploration programs by Cyprus.

Cyprus's soil survey outlined a >400 ppm Cu-in-soil anomaly over an approximate area of 1.5 km by 3 km, which overlies a broad zone of anomalous IP chargeability associated with the potassium-rich dioritic intrusions1. 

Cyprus drilled just two holes into the copper porphyry target zone. These holes were drilled prior to Cyprus conducting their IP survey. A 2014 geophysical inversion of the IP data shows that the holes were both drilled at the northeast edge of a weaker portion of the anomaly, as shown in Figures 1-3. Regardless, holes MDD-1 and MDD-2 both intersected copper mineralization accompanied by distal alteration (propylitic) that typically surrounds the outer margin of a porphyry copper system. Gold and molybdenum were not assayed for at the time, however modern sampling indicates the presence of both metals within the porphyry target. MDD-2 assayed 266 m of 0.17% Cu from 5 m depth to the end of the hole at 271 m. Hole MDD-1 assayed 52 m of 0.13% Cu from 70 m to 122 m, and 151 m of 0.11% Cu from 151 m to end-of-hole at 302 m1,[2]. This grade of mineralization is consistent with distal propylitic alteration, which was historically logged by Cyprus throughout these holes. The main body of the chargeability anomaly, as outlined by the purple dashed lines on Figures 1-3, has not yet been tested.

In 2013, Newmont Corporation ("**Newmont** ") carried out an evaluation of the Property and collected 41 select rock grab samples at mineralized showings and 213 soil samples on a regular 100m spaced grid that covers a portion of the porphyry target. The soil results revealed a strong copper-gold-molybdenum anomaly, with values ranging up to 6,370 ppm Cu, 206 ppb Au, and 65 ppm Mo, over 1.8 kilometers in length[3]. The soil anomaly is consistent with a porphyry copper target that remains open for expansion. Select rock grab samples returned up to 30.3 g/t Au, 852 ppm Mo and 5.9% Cu. Figures 1-3 present the anomalous geochemistry and IP chargeability associated with the porphyry copper-gold zone.

In 2014, Radius Gold Inc. ("**Radius** ") leased the Property from Merrill Palmer and flew a large airborne magnetic and radiometric survey, carried out selective rock and soil sampling and carried out a modern inversion of the digitized historical IP geophysical data. Geophysical inversions provide machine interpreted 3D models of both resistivity and chargeability data. A depth slice of the 3D chargeability model is presented on Figures 1-3.

More recently, prospecting work undertaken by the Lessor, Merrill Palmer, has reported the existence of 0.1 to 1 m thick quartz-tourmaline veins within the intrusion that grade up to 20.1 g/t Au and 5% Cu to the southeast of the historical Jessie mine3. This zone has not been tested by drilling.
