ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
7 April 2025 
Rumble acquires 100% of the Thunderstorm 
Gold Project 
Highlights 
• 
Rumble has entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding 70% in three exploration 
tenements in the Fraser Range Province from joint venture partner IGO Limited to secure 100% of 
the highly prospective Thunderstorm Gold Project  
• 
The Thunderstorm Project includes the gold discoveries at Gazelle and Pion 
• 
At the Gazelle Prospect, wide-spaced drilling on 1,500m traverses returned high-grade 
palaeochannel/supergene gold mineralisation. Results included: 
o 
16m @ 6.69 g/t Au from 42m (20AFAC11321)1 
o 
6m @ 9.15 g/t Au from 48m (18AFAC30771)1 
• 
The Pion Prospect returned gold anomalism in six consecutive drill holes over a section length of 
1.2km with the best intersection returning: 
o 
4m @ 3.80 g/t Au from 86m (18AFAC20486)2 
• 
The style of gold mineralisation is considered having potential for hosting both large-scale 
palaeochannel and primary basement gold deposits 
o 
Palaeochannel Gold Deposits 
The Gazelle and Pion gold prospects have similar characteristics to the palaeochannel/placer 
gold deposits of the Higginsville Gold Centre (120km south of Kalgoorlie). A number of these 
style deposits were mined successfully with the main deposit, Challenger, returning over 
230,000oz @ 3.4g/t Au  
o 
Primary Basement Gold Deposits 
Wide zones of supergene gold anomalism with the higher-grade core zones at Gazelle (16m @ 
6.69 g/t Au) is indicative of a potential proximal primary basement source 
Peter Harold, Managing Director and CEO commented: 
“We are pleased to have secured the balance of the Thunderstorm Gold Project from IGO under attractive terms. The 
Project contains two high-grade gold discoveries at Gazelle and Pion. Based on this and the style of mineralisation we 
believe there is significant potential to discover large scale palaeochannel and primary basement hosted gold deposits. 
Our exploration team is preparing an exploration program and budget for the next phase of work which will be an infill 
aircore drill program at Gazelle.”

Rumble Resources Limited (ASX: RTR) (“Rumble” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered 
in an agreement to acquire the outstanding 70% in three exploration tenements in the Fraser Province from joint 
venture partner IGO Limited (“IGO”) and thus securing 100% of the highly prospective Thunderstorm Gold 
Project. 
Acquisition Terms 
• 
Purchase price of $300,000  to be paid in Rumble fully paid shares (“Consideration Shares”) at a deemed 
issue price of the 5-day VWAP immediately prior to the Execution Date. The Consideration Shares will 
be issued at completion of the acquisition, without Rumble shareholder approval using Rumble’s existing 
placement capacity available under ASX Listing Rule 7.1. 
• 
1.05% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty over E28/2528, E28/2595, and E28/2529 
Project Overview 
The Thunderstorm Gold Project comprises six granted exploration licenses (E28/2528, E28/2529, E28/2595, 
E28/3219, E28/3240 and E28/3384) for a total area of 348 km². The Project lies over a major northeast trending 
terrane boundary (Newman Shear Zone) between the Fraser Zone (hosting the Nova Ni Deposit-IGO) and the 
Nornalup Zone. The project area is completely under cover (mainly Eocene to Miocene) and sits on the edge of 
the Eucla Basin (Cenozoic). 
Previous exploration completed by IGO includes 530 vertical air core drill holes over an area of approximately 
40km by 20km on 1,500m line spacings. Airborne geophysics including magnetics and EM (Spectrum EM survey) 
complemented the drilling.  
Results from the air core drilling returned widespread gold anomalism from within both the lower Cenozoic cover 
sequence and the underlying gneissic rocks (see Figure 1). Higher tenor gold mineralization discovered at Gazelle 
and Pion is inferred to be associated with the earlier Eocene palaeodrainage systems and nearby potential 
basement gold sources. 
Gazelle Gold Prospect 
Widespread gold mineralisation at Gazelle includes: 
• 
16m @ 6.69 g/t Au from 42m (20AFAC11321) 1 
 
including 4m @ 22.2 g/t Au from 50m  
• 
6m @ 9.15 g/t Au from 48m  
• 
8m @ 1.31 g/t Au from 58m (20AFAC11310) ⃰ 
• 
4m @ 1.37 g/t Au from 70m (20AFAC11311) ⃰ 
 
Pion Gold Prospect 
Six consecutive drillholes (1.2km along section) returned gold anomalism with the best result of: 
• 
4m @ 3.80 g/t Au from 86m (18AFAC20486) ⃰ 
⃰ All Air Core Drilling Vertical – True Width

Mineralisation Style 
Research by IGO on the particulate gold from Gazelle and Pion has shown three types of gold grains are present. 
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) has shown: 
• 
Particulate gold grains derived from alluvial processes;  
• 
Chemically regrown crystalline gold grains – grown in situ; and 
• 
Chemically plated gold grains – gold deposited onto biogenic material. 
Gold found in the basement gneissic rocks is inferred to be both chemical gold mobilised from the overlying 
Cenozoic cover sequence and supergene gold mineralisation that has migrated laterally from a primary basement 
gold system.

Economic Potential 
Palaeodrainage Placer Gold Deposits 
Potential for large scale palaeodrainage placer gold deposits based on widespread gold anomalism in multiple 
inferred palaeodrainage systems within the Thunderstorm Project is very high. The best-case analogy is the 
palaeodrainage placer economic gold systems located in the Higginsville gold camp (120km south of Kalgoorlie). 
The Challenger deposit was mined over 5km in length and produced over 230,000oz @ 3.4g/t gold. 
Basement Gold Deposits 
Potential for basement gold is also very high. The wide-spaced (1,500m) air core drilling did not intersect in-situ 
economic basement gold mineralisation and alteration, however, at the Gazelle Prospect (see Figure 2), wide 
zones of anomalous gold (>100ppb Au halo) with high-grade zones is indicative of lateral supergene gold 
dispersion  close to a primary/basement source. Note that at Gazelle, high grade gold mineralisation (16m @ 
6.69 g/t Au) increases up the basement slope towards a basement high, suggesting a potential source to the 
southeast.

Next Steps 
The Company is currently planning an infill aircore drilling campaign that will initially test the attitude of the 
mineralised palaeo channel mineralisation at Gazelle. This program will commence once Heritage clearances 
are obtained.
