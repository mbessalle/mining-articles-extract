RareX gains access to bull‘s-eye magnetic anomaly in the NT Aileron 
Province prospective for Rare Earths and Niobium 
 
Engage with this announcement at the RareX investor hub. 
 
Highlights 
• 
The Piper Project contains an untested 2.5km wide bullseye magnetic anomaly forming a large carbonatite 
target under sedimentary cover in the same Aileron tectonic province extending from the West Arunta of WA 
into the NT 
• 
Aileron Province is proven to host mineralised alkaline magmatism related to a mantle hotspots, with 
multiple niobium (Nb), phosphate (P) and rare earth element (REE) carbonatite occurrences, such as the 
WA1 Resources Luni Nb discovery 380 km to the west of Piper and the Nolans Bore REE deposit 170 km to 
the southeast 
• 
Low-risk, low-cost, high-reward deal terms: 
o 
Earn-in over a five year period by drilling at least 3x 300m deep drill holes for a total of at least 1,000m 
for 80% of the project’s interest. 
o 
RareX will solely fund project development up to decision-to-mine.  
o 
The vendor can elect to be diluted from 20% to 5% of ownership following the decision-to-mine if JV 
spending is not matched after that point. 
o 
At 5% interest the vendor will either need to contribute to JV spending or relinquish its interest in the 
tenure in return for a 1.0% net smelter royalty (NSR).  
o 
During the Earn-in & Development period, RareX is responsible for all aspects of tenure ownership and 
management, as well as permitting and landholder approvals to conduct the earn-in work. 
 
RareX Limited (ASX: REE – RareX, or the Company) is pleased to announce it has formed an agreement with True 
Fella Pty Ltd (True Fella) for the Piper Project located in the Aileron Province, Northern Territory. The Piper Project 
is a carbonatite pipe target, which has similarities to RareX’s Cummins Range carbonatite in WA, and has been 
identified as a high priority drill target by the Resource Potentials geophysical team, who helped WA1 Resources 
discover the Luni carbonatite. 
 
The Piper Project will join a select group of RareX portfolio projects, including the Mt Mansbridge heavy rare earths 
project. Cummins Range is the flagship engineering project and Khaleesi is the current flagship exploration project 
within the RareX project portfolio. RareX is also active at pursuing advanced projects in other parts of the world 
whilst ensuring a pipeline of exploration projects in Australia.  
 
Managing Director, James Durrant, commented: “We are very pleased to establish a deal with True Fella Pty Ltd to 
explore the Piper Project. We believe this project has high potential to be a niobium-rare earths carbonatite pipe. The 
deal is structured to make sure the exploration dollars go into the ground and RareX is looking forward to testing True 
Fella’s geophysical carbonatite target model. We see this project as complementary to our existing niobium and REE 
exploration portfolio and a robust medium-term proposition.”

The Piper Project is located 320km north west of Alice Springs and 170km along strike to the north west from 
Nolans Bore REE deposit (resource 56Mt at 2.6% TREO1, see Figure 1). The Piper Project is comprised of 2 
tenements (see Table 1), with the smaller of the two granted and the larger tenement pending a heritage land 
access agreement. 
 
Both tenements were pegged in 2023 and, in recent months, all the surrounding ground has been applied for by 
WA1 Resources, supporting the Nb-REE-P prospectivity of the region (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 2. Image at top shows Piper Project tenements on Total Magnetic Intensity image, and bottom image shows Piper Project 
tenements on interpreted bedrock geology.  Note the magnetic carbonatite target in the top image. 
 
The Piper Project is located in the central Aileron Province of the NT and is composed of Palaeoproterozoic granite-
gneiss and Lander Rock Beds greenstone-gneiss domains, with the northern half of the tenement covered by 
younger Neoproterozoic Arumbera Sandstone from the Georgina Basin, which forms a layer that sits over the 
magnetic carbonatite target which is hosted in the Palaeoproterozoic gneiss.  
 
The carbonatite target is comprised of a strong bull’s-eye magnetic anomaly 2.5km in diameter (Figure 2 upper 
image). The geophysical anomaly sits under the Arumbera Sandstone which is interpreted to be 100m to 200m 
thick based on geophysical survey data and two historical air-core drill holes to a max depth of 93m over the 
magnetic anomaly, where none of the holes reached magnetic basement rocks (see Table 2).

The magnetic anomaly response of the carbonatite target indicates that the source body is in the upper 100m to 
200m, and the target mineralisation is Nb-REE-P similar to the Cummins Range and Mt Weld carbonatite hosted 
deposits. The Aileron province has numerous alkaline intrusion complexes along its length, including mineralised 
bodies such as niobium enriched carbonatites in the western portion of the province forming the Western Arunta, 
such as WA1 Resources and Encounter Resources projects, and the Nolans Bore rare earths deposit located 170km 
along strike to the south east of the Piper project (see Figure 1). 
 
RareX will negotiate a land access agreement with the Central Land Council on tenement EL33674 in coming 
months and will aim for a drilling program in 2025.

Key Terms 
Under the agreement, RareX will earn-in to the Piper Project over a five-year period by drilling at least 3x 300m deep 
reverse circulation or diamond holes for a total of at least 1,000m to gain an 80% interest. 
 
During the earn-in period, RareX is responsible for all aspects of tenure ownership and management, as well as 
permitting and landholder approvals to conduct the earn-in work.  
 
Following the initial drilling earn in milestone, RareX will solely fund the project development up to the decision 
point to mine the Project. 
 
Following the decision-to-mine, the project vendor, True Fella Pty Ltd (an unrelated party), can elect to match joint 
venture spending in line with its interest to retain 20% of the Project or be diluted down to a 5% ownership stake. 
At 5% interest, True Fella Pty Ltd will either need to contribute to joint venture spending or relinquish its interest in 
the tenure in exchange for a1.0% NSR type royalty.

Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, 
random chips, or specific specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of 
sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample 
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are 
Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done 
this would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation 
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg 
was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). 
In other cases, more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types 
(e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information. 
• 
Composite samples are taken on all RAB/Aircore 
drill spoil. Samples are taken as 3 metre 
composite intervals. Drill spoil is collected in a 
bucket beneath the cyclone and at the end of 
each drill rod, The sample is speared using a 
plastic tube to gain a representative sample. This 
sample is placed into a calico bag (approx. 2kg) 
and sent to the laboratory for analysis. 
 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole 
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc.) and 
details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth 
of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, 
whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
• 
Two Aircore holes were drilled as per Table 1 in 
the body of the announcement. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip 
sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and 
ensure representative nature of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery 
and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred 
due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
• 
There are no descriptions of assessing chip 
sample recoveries or results.  
• 
No measures were described in the historic 
reports regarding maximising sample recovery 
• 
There are no details in the historic reports 
regarding the relationship between sample 
recovery/grade and sample bias 
 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been geologically 
and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support 
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies 
and metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. 
Core (or costean, channel, etc.) photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged.

Commentary 
(Figure 2 upper image). The geophysical 
anomaly sits under the Arumbera Sandstone 
which is interpreted to be 100m to 200m thick. 
Historically, two air core drill holes to a max 
depth of 93m have been drilled on the anomaly 
and neither reached magnetic basement rocks 
(Table 2). 
Drillhole 
information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results including a 
tabulation of the following information for all Material 
drillholes: 
o easting and northing of the drillhole collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above 
sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o downhole length and interception depth 
o hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the 
basis that the information is not Material and this 
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of 
the report, the Competent Person should clearly 
explain why this is the case. 
• 
Drill hole details are in Table 1. 
 
Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging 
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade 
truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off 
grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths 
of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade 
results, the procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical examples of such 
aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal 
equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
• 
There are no aggregation methods.  
• 
There are no metal equivalents  
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to 
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be 
reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are 
reported, there should be a clear statement to this 
effect (e.g. ‘downhole length, true width not known’). 
• 
No mineralisation reported. 
 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and 
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any 
significant discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole 
collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Relevant diagrams are presented in the body of 
this report. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration 
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of 
both low and high grades and/or widths should be 
• 
Reported exploration results are considered 
balanced.

Commentary 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, 
should be reported including (but not limited to): 
geological observations; geophysical survey results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• 
The project is at early exploration phase. As more 
information becomes available, RareX will report 
these results. 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. 
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or 
large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible 
extensions, including the main geological 
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this 
information is not commercially sensitive.
