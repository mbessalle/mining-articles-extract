RareX gains access to bull‘s-eye magnetic anomaly in the NT Aileron 
Province prospective for Rare Earths and Niobium 
 
Engage with this announcement at the RareX investor hub. 
 
Highlights 
• 
The Piper Project contains an untested 2.5km wide bullseye magnetic anomaly forming a large carbonatite 
target under sedimentary cover in the same Aileron tectonic province extending from the West Arunta of WA 
into the NT 
• 
Aileron Province is proven to host mineralised alkaline magmatism related to a mantle hotspots, with 
multiple niobium (Nb), phosphate (P) and rare earth element (REE) carbonatite occurrences, such as the 
WA1 Resources Luni Nb discovery 380 km to the west of Piper and the Nolans Bore REE deposit 170 km to 
the southeast 
• 
Low-risk, low-cost, high-reward deal terms: 
o 
Earn-in over a five year period by drilling at least 3x 300m deep drill holes for a total of at least 1,000m 
for 80% of the project’s interest. 
o 
RareX will solely fund project development up to decision-to-mine.  
o 
The vendor can elect to be diluted from 20% to 5% of ownership following the decision-to-mine if JV 
spending is not matched after that point. 
o 
At 5% interest the vendor will either need to contribute to JV spending or relinquish its interest in the 
tenure in return for a 1.0% net smelter royalty (NSR).  
o 
During the Earn-in & Development period, RareX is responsible for all aspects of tenure ownership and 
management, as well as permitting and landholder approvals to conduct the earn-in work. 
 
RareX Limited (ASX: REE – RareX, or the Company) is pleased to announce it has formed an agreement with True 
Fella Pty Ltd (True Fella) for the Piper Project located in the Aileron Province, Northern Territory. The Piper Project 
is a carbonatite pipe target, which has similarities to RareX’s Cummins Range carbonatite in WA, and has been 
identified as a high priority drill target by the Resource Potentials geophysical team, who helped WA1 Resources 
discover the Luni carbonatite. 
 
The Piper Project will join a select group of RareX portfolio projects, including the Mt Mansbridge heavy rare earths 
project. Cummins Range is the flagship engineering project and Khaleesi is the current flagship exploration project 
within the RareX project portfolio. RareX is also active at pursuing advanced projects in other parts of the world 
whilst ensuring a pipeline of exploration projects in Australia.  
 
Managing Director, James Durrant, commented: “We are very pleased to establish a deal with True Fella Pty Ltd to 
explore the Piper Project. We believe this project has high potential to be a niobium-rare earths carbonatite pipe. The 
deal is structured to make sure the exploration dollars go into the ground and RareX is looking forward to testing True 
Fella’s geophysical carbonatite target model. We see this project as complementary to our existing niobium and REE 
exploration portfolio and a robust medium-term proposition.”

The Piper Project is located 320km north west of Alice Springs and 170km along strike to the north west from 
Nolans Bore REE deposit (resource 56Mt at 2.6% TREO1, see Figure 1). The Piper Project is comprised of 2 
tenements (see Table 1), with the smaller of the two granted and the larger tenement pending a heritage land 
access agreement. 
 
Both tenements were pegged in 2023 and, in recent months, all the surrounding ground has been applied for by 
WA1 Resources, supporting the Nb-REE-P prospectivity of the region (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 2. Image at top shows Piper Project tenements on Total Magnetic Intensity image, and bottom image shows Piper Project 
tenements on interpreted bedrock geology.  Note the magnetic carbonatite target in the top image. 
 
The Piper Project is located in the central Aileron Province of the NT and is composed of Palaeoproterozoic granite-
gneiss and Lander Rock Beds greenstone-gneiss domains, with the northern half of the tenement covered by 
younger Neoproterozoic Arumbera Sandstone from the Georgina Basin, which forms a layer that sits over the 
magnetic carbonatite target which is hosted in the Palaeoproterozoic gneiss.  
 
The carbonatite target is comprised of a strong bull’s-eye magnetic anomaly 2.5km in diameter (Figure 2 upper 
image). The geophysical anomaly sits under the Arumbera Sandstone which is interpreted to be 100m to 200m 
thick based on geophysical survey data and two historical air-core drill holes to a max depth of 93m over the 
magnetic anomaly, where none of the holes reached magnetic basement rocks (see Table 2).

The magnetic anomaly response of the carbonatite target indicates that the source body is in the upper 100m to 
200m, and the target mineralisation is Nb-REE-P similar to the Cummins Range and Mt Weld carbonatite hosted 
deposits. The Aileron province has numerous alkaline intrusion complexes along its length, including mineralised 
bodies such as niobium enriched carbonatites in the western portion of the province forming the Western Arunta, 
such as WA1 Resources and Encounter Resources projects, and the Nolans Bore rare earths deposit located 170km 
along strike to the south east of the Piper project (see Figure 1). 
 
RareX will negotiate a land access agreement with the Central Land Council on tenement EL33674 in coming 
months and will aim for a drilling program in 2025.

Key Terms 
Under the agreement, RareX will earn-in to the Piper Project over a five-year period by drilling at least 3x 300m deep 
reverse circulation or diamond holes for a total of at least 1,000m to gain an 80% interest. 
 
During the earn-in period, RareX is responsible for all aspects of tenure ownership and management, as well as 
permitting and landholder approvals to conduct the earn-in work.  
 
Following the initial drilling earn in milestone, RareX will solely fund the project development up to the decision 
point to mine the Project. 
 
Following the decision-to-mine, the project vendor, True Fella Pty Ltd (an unrelated party), can elect to match joint 
venture spending in line with its interest to retain 20% of the Project or be diluted down to a 5% ownership stake. 
At 5% interest, True Fella Pty Ltd will either need to contribute to joint venture spending or relinquish its interest in 
the tenure in exchange for a1.0% NSR type royalty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
About RareX Limited – ASX: REE 
RareX is a critical minerals company specialising in rare earths and niobium in hard rock carbonatites. 
 
The exploration focus of the business is on the new Khaleesi Project in the East Yilgarn which is a district-scale, 
elevated-niobium, alkaline intrusive complex - a breeding ground for mineralised carbonatites. Data from Tier-1 
exploration programs with elevated niobium values suggests a highly fertile system. 
 
The Company’s engineering and commercial focus is on offtake and approvals at the mid-study-level, Cummins 
Range Project (+$330M NPV8 post-tax*) - a carbonatite hosted rare earths and phosphate project, containing 
magnet grade rare earths and battery grade phosphates and technically Australia’s largest undeveloped rare 
earths project. 
 
RareX have been curating a portfolio of carbonatite related prospects within which the newly acquired Khaleesi 
Project represents the exploration flagship. RareX will continue to develop and optimise its portfolio.  
 
RareX maintains material investments in Kincora Copper (ASX:KCC), Cosmos Exploration (ASX:C1X) and Canada Rare 
Earth Corporation (LL.V).
