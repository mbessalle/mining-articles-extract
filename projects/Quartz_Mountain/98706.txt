The Q-Gold common shares to be issued to Alamos upon closing of the Transaction, or at a later date, are to be based on a 10-day volume weighted average trading price prior to the date of issuance. Torys LLP is acting as legal advisor to Alamos.

The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature.

Alamos cautions that forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon several factors and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management at the time of making such statements, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, technical, legal, political and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information.

These factors and assumptions include, but are not limited to: failure by either party to meet requisite closing conditions for the Transaction; actions required to trigger Milestone Payments not being implemented or coming to fruition; changes within Q-Gold, or issues with respect to permitting and/or construction causing non-advancement of the Quartz Mountain project; the actual results of current exploration activities; conclusions of economic and geological evaluations; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; operations may be exposed to serious illness, disease, epidemics and/or pandemics, any regulatory responses to same, and any of their associated impacts on the broader market; changes in national and local government legislation, controls or regulations; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; labour and contractor availability (and being able to secure the same on favourable terms); ability to sell or deliver gold doré bars; disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; fluctuations in the price of gold or certain other commodities such as, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and changes to production estimates (which assume accuracy of projected ore grade, mining rates, recovery timing and recovery rate estimates and may be impacted by unscheduled maintenance); changes in foreign exchange rates (particularly the Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar, Mexican peso and Turkish Lira); the impact of inflation, the implementation of tariffs, trade barriers and/or regulatory costs; employee and community relations; litigation and administrative proceedings; disruptions affecting operations; availability of and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labour; risks associated with the start-up of new mines; delays with the Phase 3+ Expansion Project at the Island Gold mine; delays in the development or updating of mine plans; delays in the construction of the Lynn Lake Project or the Puerto Del Aire Project; changes that may be required to the intended method of accessing and mining the deposit at Puerto Del Aire and Lynn Lake projects; inherent risks and hazards associated with mining and mineral processing including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures and cave-ins; the risk that the Company’s mines may not perform as planned; uncertainty with the Company's ability to secure additional capital to execute its business plans; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; risks in obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses, permits and authorizations for the Company’s development stage and operating assets; risk that required amendments to existing permits for the Lynn Lake project to accommodate the Burnt Timber and Linkwood deposits may not be obtained; contests over title to properties; expropriation or nationalization of property; political or economic developments in Canada, Mexico, the United States, Türkiye and other jurisdictions in which the Company may carry on business in the future; increased costs and risks related to the potential impact of climate change; the costs and timing of construction and development of new deposits; effects of construction decisions, risk of loss due to sabotage, protests and other civil disturbances; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; and business opportunities that may be pursued by the Company.
