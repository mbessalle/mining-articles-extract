GREENVALE ACQUIRES THE DOUGLAS RIVER URANIUM 
PROJECT IN THE WORLD-CLASS PINE CREEK MINERAL 
FIELD, NT 
 
High-potential sandstone-hosted uranium project contains multiple shallow drill-ready 
targets analogous to the Honeymoon deposit in South Australia 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
• 
Greenvale enters into a binding Heads of Agreement with Gempart Pty Ltd to 
acquire an initial 80% interest in the Douglas River Uranium Project, located 
200km south of Darwin in the Pine Creek Mineral Field. 
• 
The project is highly prospective for a suite of elements including uranium, tin 
and gold. 
• 
The Pine Creek Region is one of the world’s largest and richest uranium 
provinces, containing the Alligator River (Ranger and Jabiluka) deposits as well 
as the Rum Jungle and South Alligator Valley (Coronation Hill and El Sherana) 
deposits.  
• 
Despite this, the region remains lightly explored – particularly in the southern 
Daly Basin area, where the geology supports multiple ideal settings for 
sandstone-hosted uranium deposits. 
• 
The Douglas Project contains multiple Uranium/Thorium ratio anomalies 
concentrated within two interpreted palaeo-channels on the western and 
eastern margins of the tenements.  
• 
Two compelling high-order radiometric anomalies have been identified in the 
eastern palaeo-channel which are walk-up drill targets prospective for 
sandstone-hosted uranium mineralisation analogous to the Honeymoon (Boss 
Energy), Pamela/Angela and Napperby (Core Lithium) deposits.  
• 
These targets are interpreted to be shallow, less than 50m depth, and subject 
to field inspection could potentially be drilled using low-cost auger, sonic or 
air-core methods. 
Greenvale Energy Limited (ASX: GRV, “Greenvale” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise 
it has further enhanced its Australian energy portfolio with the acquisition of a highly 
prospective sandstone-hosted uranium exploration project in the prolific Pine Creek 
Mineral Field in the Northern Territory.  
Greenvale has entered into an acquisition agreement with Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd over 
EL33670 and ELA33900 (Figure 1), comprising the Douglas River Uranium Project, which 
is located in the Daly Basin on the south-western portion of the Pine Creek Mineral Field.

Greenvale has secured the rights to obtain an immediate 80% interest in the two 
tenements with the original project owners, Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd, being free-carried 
through to a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). Greenvale has incurred a small upfront cost 
of approximately $20,000, payable to Gempart as reimbursement of data acquisition costs 
to secure its 80% interest in the tenements. 
Management Comment 
Greenvale CEO, Mark Turner said: “This is a compelling addition to Greenvale’s portfolio, 
giving our shareholders exposure to a commodity which has exceptional market fundamentals 
because of the growing use of nuclear energy as an essential source of baseload energy for 
the global energy transition.   
“The Douglas Project is an extensive and highly prospective ground package located in the 
heart of one of the world’s great uranium provinces, which hosts several world-class deposits 
and yet has remained virtually unexplored for over a decade. Importantly, the farm-in 
agreement is attractively structured with a low upfront entry cost and, because the targets are 
shallow, the project can be explored with low-cost drilling techniques.   
“There are multiple uranium/thorium ratio anomalies within two interpreted palaeo-channels, 
including two compelling drill targets on the eastern side of the tenements. These targets are 
analogous to the Honeymoon deposit in South Australia, which recently commenced 
operations, as well as the Pamela/Angela and Napperby deposits. We are very much looking

forward to getting on the ground and commencing exploration activities at this exciting new 
project.”  
The Project 
The Douglas Project is located approximately 200km south of Darwin in the Daly Basin on 
the south-western side of the Pine Creek Mineral Field. The project area has been 
historically explored for a number of minerals including uranium, gold, tin, base metals 
and diamonds with extensive anomalism defined from surface sampling (Figure 2.) 
 
Figure 2: EL 33670 & ELA 33900 Historical surface sampling 
 
The most recent exploration by United Uranium in 2012 included a Tempest airborne EM 
survey over the entire project area and a close-spaced (50m) airborne radiometric survey 
over a well-defined geochemical anomaly in the eastern paleochannel.  
United’s work defined two significant paleochannels (Figure 3) located on the eastern and 
western margins of the Project area. Historical 400m line spaced airborne 
magnetics/radiometric survey by the NTGS had defined multiple U/Th ratio anomalies 
which are concentrated within the eastern and western paleochannels with two highly 
anomalous zones defined in the eastern paleochannel.  
United followed up eastern paleochannel ground sampling with a close-spaced airborne 
radiometric survey immediately over the south-eastern anomaly which defined a 
significant drill target. United abruptly ceased work subsequent to the Fukushima tsunami 
impact. The south-eastern anomaly is considered by Greenvale to be an immediate drill 
target.

The north-eastern uranium anomaly is defined by 400m line spacing radiometrics and 
requires close-spaced (100m) airborne radiometrics to better define the anomaly prior to 
drilling. 
Greenvale proposes to fly 100m spaced airborne magnetics/radiometrics over the entire 
project area as a precursor to ground exploration.

Key Terms of the agreement 
• The tenements vendor is Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd. 
• Purchaser is Greenvale Utilities Pty Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Greenvale Energy Ltd. 
• Greenvale to earn an 80% project interest by completing a Definitive Feasibility 
Study. The 80% interest is transferred to Greenvale upfront. 
• There is no time limit on completing the DFS, Greenvale to maintain tenements in 
good standing for duration of earn in period. 
• Greenvale may withdraw at any time and the tenements will revert to Gempart. 
• Once Greenvale has earned its 80% interest Gempart can opt to contribute pro rata 
to maintain its 20% interest or 1. Negotiate to sell its interest to Greenvale 2. Convert 
its 20% interest to a 1.5% NSR.

Historical Exploration Summary 
NTGS databases “Historical Mineral Titles” and “GEMIS” were interrogated to capture past 
exploration titles overlapping EL33900 and EL33670, and all relevant reports were 
reviewed. Table 1 is a summary of historical titles and results reported.    
 
Previous exploration efforts relevant to the area of EL33900 and EL33670 involving 
investigations or collection of new data are summarised thereafter. A plan summarising 
previous surface sampling and results is included in Figure 2. 
 
Work on many promising prospects ceased prematurely due to corporate restructuring 
by the major exploration/mining companies, or lack of funds in the junior sector 
particularly in the period 2012-2015.
