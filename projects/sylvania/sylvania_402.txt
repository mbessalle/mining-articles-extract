ASX Announcement 
ASX:LAT 
23 December 2024 
Sylvania Project Sale Completed 
 
Latitude 66 Limited, ACN 115 768 986 (ASX: LAT) (“Lat66” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise that 
the Sylvania Project sale transaction with Capricorn Metals (CMM) has now been completed. The Sylvania 
Project is located in the Pilbara Region of Western Australia immediately to the west (approximately 60km) 
of CMM’s Karlawinda gold mine. 
As per ASX Release on 9 December 2024, the Binding Sale Agreement includes Consideration and Net 
Smelter Royalty components, as outlined below. Pursuant to these terms, CMM has now issued 228,391 
fully paid ordinary shares to Lat66 under Consideration (a) and granted the Net Smelter Royalties for both 
precious and non-precious minerals.  
Latitude 66’s Managing Director, Grant Coyle, commented: 
“Lat66 is pleased to have completed the sale of the Sylvania Project to Capricorn Metals. The sale realises 
latent value for shareholders from a non-core Australian asset and boosts funding for Latitude 66’s future 
exploration and development activities in Northern Finland. 
“As we advance our Finnish Projects towards development, we will continue to pursue opportunities to 
realise further value from our remaining Australian assets.”

(c) $750,000 (plus GST) payable on the date CMM makes a decision to commence a stand-alone
