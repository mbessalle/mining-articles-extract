# Kraken Energy Executes Binding Letter Agreement for the Harts Point Uranium Property, Utah

****Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - May 2, 2023) -**Kraken Energy Corp.**(**CSE: UUSA) (OTCQB: UUSAF**) (the "**Company** " or "**Kraken** ") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of agreement (the "**Agreement** ") to acquire up to a 75% interest in the Harts Point Uranium Property (Figures 1 & 2) in San Juan County, southeast Utah ("**Harts Point** " or the "**Property** "). The Property is located in the center of the Colorado Plateau, referred to by some as "the US version of the Athabasca Basin," and is 64 kilometers ("km") (40 miles) north of the White Mesa Uranium Mill, the only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the United States.

_Garrett Ainsworth, Chairman of Kraken, commented: "Since Kraken's inception in mid-2022, we have been reviewing numerous uranium properties in the western US to acquire or option. This process has led us to selecting the Harts Point Uranium Property based on its potential to host another Lisbon Valley style trend of uranium deposits. Harts Point has been de-risked from an exploration standpoint given that there are three widely spaced historic oil and gas wells that encountered intervals of off-scale radioactivity within the favorable Chinle Formation host rock. Historic uranium mining has taken place 11 km west of the Property where the Chinle Formation outcrops, which confirms that significant uranium mineralization is associated with the flanks of the Harts Point anticline feature."_

**Harts Point Property Highlights:**

  * **World class uranium jurisdiction:** located in the center of the Colorado Plateau, which has produced **over 328 million ("M") pounds ("lbs") U****3****O****8****at 0.2 to 0.4% U****3****O****8** since the 1950s1.
  * Property consists of **324 lode mining claims** on Bureau of Land Management ("**BLM** ") ground that covers an area of **2,622 hectares ("ha") (6,480 acres)**.
  * **Harts Point Anticline is Analogous to the Lisbon Valley Anticline:** where the Lisbon Valley Uranium District (Figure 1) had **17 large uranium mines which produced approximately 80M lbs U****3****O****8****at 0.34% U****3****O****8** from 1948 to 19882.
    * The dimensions of these tabular sandstone-hosted uranium deposits range from **2 to 13 meters ("m") (7 to 43 feet) thick, 100 to 3,048 m (328 to 10,000 feet) long, and 31 to 427 m (100 to 1,400 feet) wide** 3.
  * **Significant Historic Uranium Production:**
    * Several historic mines located 11 km (7 miles) west of the Harts Point Property produced approximately **280,000 lbs U****3****O****8****at 0.3% U****3****O****8** from the **favorable Chinle Formation host rock** 4**.**
    * The Lisbon Valley Anticline is located 31 km (19 miles) to the east of the Harts Point Property (Figure 1) produced approximately **80M lbs U****3****O****8****0.3% U****3****O****8** 2**.**
  * **Historic Exploration:** **Three wide-spaced historic oil and gas wells on the Property** (Figure 2) along the east flank of the Harts Point Anticline **show 'off-scale' radioactivity within the favorable Chinle Formation host rock.**
  * **Permitted to Drill:** The Harts Point Property is **permitted for up to 25 exploration drill holes** upon payment of the US$58,000 bond to the BLM.
  * **Excellent Infrastructure:** located approximately **64 km (40 miles) north of the White Mesa uranium processing facility.**
      * There is excellent access throughout the Property, which is situated 45 km (28 miles) from the town of Monticello, Utah.

**Terms of the Agreement:**

Under the terms of the Agreement, the parties will enter into a definitive option agreement (the "Option Agreement") within 60 days, pursuant to which the Company may acquire up to 75% of the Harts Point Property from Atomic Minerals Corporation (**TSXV: ATOM**) ("**Atomic** ") by meeting the following requirements:

  * Kraken will be the operator and must incur US$1.5 million of eligible expenditures within 18 months from the date of the Option Agreement to earn a 65% interest.
  * Kraken has the option to increase interest in the Property from 65% to 75% by incurring an additional US$2.0 million of eligible expenditures within 30 months from the date of the Option Agreement and issuing Atomic 2.0 million common shares of Kraken.
  * Kraken will grant Atomic a 2.0% net smelter royalty (subject to a buy down to 1.0% for US$5.0 million).
  * After the initial option (Kraken 65%: Atomic 35%) or the extended option (Kraken 75%: Atomic 25%), a definitive Joint Venture Agreement will be formed.
