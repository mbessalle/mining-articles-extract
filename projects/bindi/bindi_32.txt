INFINITY ACQUIRES GOLD PROJECTS
KEY POINTS
 Acquisition of 100% of four granted, advanced high-grade gold exploration
assets in the Lachlan Fold Belt, Victoria.
 Project tenure covers historical gold fields, drill ready high-grade targets with
huge untested upside.
 Comstock Prospect – UNDRILLED, Shallow (<50m) walk-up drill targets defined
by coincident I.P. geophysics and gold rock chip sampling up to 4.4 g/t gold
(Au) and 303 g/t silver (Ag).
 Comstock Prospect - Drill ready with drill permits approved, environmental
bonding in place and land holder access agreements secured, facilitating a
near term exploration programme.
 Forsyth Prospect – only 5 holes to date yet returned results such as 5.35m @
4.7 g/t gold (Au), 334 g/t silver (Ag) from 143m (FS11-01). Mineralisation open.
Landholder agreements are in place to facilitate further drilling.
 Acquisition required modest upfront consideration with payment weighted to
shared success of exploration.
 Immediate exploration now activity possible whilst San Jose Lithium Project
Mining Licence Application is being assessed.
Infinity Lithium Corpora(cid:415)on Limited (‘Infinity’, or ‘the Company’) is pleased to announce the
acquisi(cid:415)on of a 100% interest in Highland Resources Limited (Highland), a subsidiary of unlisted
company, Jubilee Metals Limited. Jubilee is solely focussed on the financing and proposed
development of its proposed Croydon gold project in Queensland, enabling Infinity to acquire these
prospec(cid:415)ve explora(cid:415)on licenses (see Schedule 1) for minimal upfront considera(cid:415)on.

Infinity Execu(cid:415)ve Chairman Mr Adrian Byass said “Following a due diligence period we are very pleased
to have acquired these en(cid:415)cing explora(cid:415)on assets, which have been underexplored over the past
several years. Set against a backdrop of strengthening gold prices and increased ac(cid:415)vity in eastern
Australia, the Company intends to rapidly and cost-effec(cid:415)vely test these explora(cid:415)on assets whilst it
maintains progress in Spain with its Direct Exploita(cid:415)on Concession Applica(cid:415)on (‘ECA’) (‘Mining Licence
Applica(cid:415)on') for San Jose. To that end the Company is mindful of the con(cid:415)nued downturn in the broader
lithium market and delays experienced with administra(cid:415)ve bodies managing the permi(cid:427)ng of San
Jose. “
Highland Gold Assets
Highland Resources Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiary Pele Resource Pty Ltd, holds a 100%
interest in four granted Explora(cid:415)on Licences in eastern Victoria (Schedule 1). All have proven gold
mineralisa(cid:415)on evident in either historical gold workings (Bindi, Goodhope-Union, Mi(cid:425)a, Cobungra) or
from modern explora(cid:415)on results (Cobungra Project). These tenements are located in Victoria within
the prospec(cid:415)ve Lachlan Fold Belt (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Highland Resources Limited tenure.
Highlights of the Highland assets (as acquired by Infinity) are summarised in the following;

Cobungra Project
The Cobungra Project (Figure 2) is characterised by structurally controlled, intrusive-related gold
mineralisa(cid:415)on as highlighted by lineaments of historical workings (Figure 2). These historical workings
are characterised by mineralisa(cid:415)on hosted in brecciated, silica-sulphide rich altera(cid:415)on. Two NNW-SSE
trends hos(cid:415)ng several gold workings are evident and interpreted to be possible dilu(cid:415)onary splays off
the Ensay Shear Zone.
The Comstock Gold-Silver Prospect lies 2 km along strike to the southeast from Forsyth Prospect. At
this prospect, rock chip samples returned up to 4.4 g/t Au and 302.6 g/t Ag (Table 1). Geophysical (I.P)
targets were defined in 2011-2014, but these remain untested. There has been no drilling to date.
The Company views this as an extremely compelling target which is intends to expedite explora(cid:415)on
on.
Figure 2: Cobungra Project (EL 7073) showing location of Forsyth and Comstock prospects.

The Forsyth Gold-Silver Prospect (also inside the Cobungra Project) was explored by Mt Wills Gold
Mines, with a diamond drilling programme of 5 drillholes for 704m in 2011-2. Significant results
returned:
 5.35 m @ 4.7 g/t Au, 334.2 g/t Ag from 143 m,
including 1.3 m @ 11.5 g/t Au, 906 g/t Ag from 74m in (FS11-01).
 2.9m @ 0.7 g/t Au, 134 g/t Ag from 58m,
and 0.75m @ 3.7 g/t Au, 185 g/t Ag from 64m (FS-04)
There has been no follow up explora(cid:415)on at Forsyth since 2012.
The historical results are detailed in Table 1. Subsequent to drilling at the Forsyth prospect, addi(cid:415)onal
explora(cid:415)on (geophysics and rock chip sampling) was conducted at Comstock prospect, 2km along
strike to the southeast which has iden(cid:415)fied shallow (<50m) drilling targets (Figure 3). Access has been
obtained but these have not yet been drilled. These are high priority targets for Infinity.
At this prospect, rock chip samples returned up to 4.4 g/t Au and 302.6 g/t Ag. Soil geochemical
anomalies and IP targets were defined in 2011-2014, but these remain untested. There has been no
drilling to date. The I.P. survey conducted consisted of 8 lines totalling 7.2km.

photograph, rock chip results and interpreted coincident linear IP anomalies as target vectors (proposed drilling).

The Comstock prospect within the Cobungra Project is in open pasture (Figure 4) and land access has
been obtained for explora(cid:415)on ac(cid:415)vity with the landowner, drilling permits have been obtained from
regulators and environmental bonding is in place.
There are no further permi(cid:427)ng or land access requirements to be completed prior to mobilisa(cid:415)on of
a drilling contractor. This prospect offers a further near-term explora(cid:415)on opportunity with a high-
impact target. There are several other geologically similar opportuni(cid:415)es within the subparallel
structural trends in the Project. These include historic workings such as such as Mountain Maid
(undrilled) (Figure 2) where samples of altered (unassayed) were obtained from a road cu(cid:427)ng (Figure
5).

The photograph shown in Figure 5 is a photograph of a poten(cid:415)al host rock. The rocks photographed
do not contain visual gold mineralisa(cid:415)on nor do the images imply that gold mineralisa(cid:415)on is present.
Mi(cid:425)a, Goodhope-Union and Bindi Projects
Other projects within the por(cid:414)olio (Mi(cid:425)a, Good Hope-Union, Bindi) are equally prospec(cid:415)ve
geologically though have had less modern explora(cid:415)on ac(cid:415)vity to define immediate drilling targets. The
Company believes they offer good opportunity explora(cid:415)on programmes being formulated for
prospects such as the northern extension of the Banimboola Quartz-Monzogranite which extends into
the north-eastern por(cid:415)on of the tenement (Mi(cid:425)a Project, EL 7072). Here, gossanous iron-staining from
sulphidic altera(cid:415)on is evident in shear zones exposed in road cu(cid:427)ngs (Figure 6).

This prospect (Granite Flat North) area covers the northern extension of the Banimboola Quartz-

Mining Limited (Figure 7) which has recorded hits such as 19m @ 9.4 g/t Au and 19 g/t Ag from 28m
(ASX release Dart Mining ASX.DTM 8 March 2021).

Acquisi(cid:415)on Summary
The agreement to acquire the Highland projects has been structured to incen(cid:415)ve explora(cid:415)on success
and reward for both par(cid:415)es (Schedule 2), with a modest upfront payment, predominantly comprising
Infinity shares ($50,000 cash and 10,000,000 Ordinary Shares in Infinity (ini(cid:415)ally approximately 2.5%
of issued capital), therefore maximising the alloca(cid:415)on of funds to explora(cid:415)on.
Performance Rights will vest based on shared success resul(cid:415)ng in increased explora(cid:415)on ac(cid:415)vity
(drilling) and discovery (JORC mineral resource es(cid:415)mates). Key Terms of the acquisi(cid:415)on agreement are
detailed in Schedule 2. Infinity Shares and Performance Rights will be issued within the Company’s
exis(cid:415)ng ASX Lis(cid:415)ng Rule 7.1 placement capacity. A capital structure is contained in Schedule 3.

The Company is well funded to pursue both the permi(cid:427)ng process in Spain and to advance explora(cid:415)on
in Victoria (ASX December Quarterly Report 29 January 2025). The Company intends to provide further
informa(cid:415)on including a more detailed explora(cid:415)on programme shortly.
As noted above, the Company con(cid:415)nues to work with regulators in the permi(cid:427)ng process for San Jose
in Spain. As noted in prior ASX announcements, public consulta(cid:415)on as ini(cid:415)ally proposed was delayed
and addi(cid:415)onal requirements prior to public consulta(cid:415)on have been requested.
