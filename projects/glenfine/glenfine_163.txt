S2 ACQUIRES FOURTH NEW GOLD PROJECT IN VICTORIA 
FROM VALKEA RESOURCES AS THE FINAL PART OF THE 
RECENTLY COMPLETED SALE OF ITS FINNISH ASSETS  
Key Points 
• S2 finalises terms to earn in to Valkea Resources’ (formerly Outback Goldfields) 
51% interest in the Glenfine Joint Venture (subject to TSXV approval) 
  
• The Glenfine JV covers 92 square kilometres and straddles 25 strike kilometres 
of the Avoca Fault zone in the north central goldfields of Victoria, Australia 
 
• Known gold mineralisation with existing high grade intercepts to be followed up 
  
• S2 can earn Valkea’s 51% interest by spending A$200,000 within four years 
 
• This is the final component of the sale of S2’s Finnish assets to Valkea 
 
S2 Resources Ltd (“S2” or the “Company”) advises that it has signed an earn-in agreement with Valkea 
Resources1 (“Valkea”, formerly Outback Goldfields Corp, TSXV:OZ) to assume its 51% interest in the 
Glenfine Joint Venture in central Victoria. This represents the final component of the multi-faceted 
transaction centred on the sale of S2’s Finnish assets as announced late last year (see S2 ASX 
announcement of 19th September 2024). It also supplements S2’s recently announced earn-in to three 
other Valkea projects in Victoria (see S2 ASX announcement of 4th December 2024), giving the company 
exposure to significant gold-prospective acreage in the state. 
The Glenfine JV covers an area of 92 square kilometres, comprising two granted exploration licences 
(EL5344 and EL5434), and is located to the south of the recently acquired Silverspoon, Yeungroon and 
Ballarat West exploration projects (see S2 ASX announcement of 4 December 2024).  
The project covers approximately 25 strike kilometres of the Avoca Fault (see Figure 1), which is the 
major crustal boundary between the Bendigo Zone (to the east) and the Stawell Zone (to the west), 
and is located within the Pitfield Plains goldfields, mined between the late 1800s and 1908, with 
numerous occurrences of alluvial “deep-lead” mine workings and also hardrock gold mineralisation at 
the Glenfine South mine, which produced 43.7 thousand ounces of gold at an average grade of 16 g/t 
gold2 (see Figure 2).  
Notes

Exploration to date has focused on the hard rock mineralisation occurrences within Cambrian turbidite 
metasediments on the flanks of the Glenfine dome, located in the immediate hangingwall of the Avoca 
Fault (see Figure 2).  The Glenfine dome has a core of Cambrian basalts overlain by carbonaceous 
sediments, similar to the geological setting of the Stawell Gold Mine.   
At Glenfine South, previous diamond and RC drilling has targeted a 1,000 metre strike extent and has 
defined at least two NNE trending mineralised structures, dipping moderately to the west, although 
the data suggests significant complexity.  The main Glenfine reef is reported as a massive to laminated 
quartz reef up to 12.7 metres true with, displaying laminations and stylolites, with disseminated 
arsenopyrite and pyrite with minor galena and sphalerite.

Earn-in terms 
The agreement is subject to Valkea obtaining the approval of the TSX Venture exchange and also 
receiving Ministerial approval and registration under section 71 of the Mineral Resources (Sustainable 
Development) Act 1990 in Victoria, Australia. 
Under the terms of this agreement, S2 has the right to earn Valkea’s 51% interest in the Glenfine Joint 
Venture by sole funding a total expenditure of $200,000 within 4 years.  The four year earn-in period 
is deemed to start once the above conditions have been met. S2 can withdraw at any time providing 
the tenements are in good standing on a pro-rata expenditure commitment basis for a minimum of 
three months from the date of its withdrawal notice. In the event of S2 being unable to undertake 
exploration as a consequence of land access or permitting delays or restrictions outside of its 
reasonable control, then S2 will be entitled to a fair and reasonable extension to the earn-in term. 
Should S2 complete its earnin, it will assume Valkea’s rights and obligations as a partner in the Glenfine 
Joint Venture, the balance of which is held by ASX-listed Predictive Discovery and private company 
Cape Clear Minerals. In the event of earnin, S2 will grant Valkea a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, 
which S2 can buy back for CAD2 million at any time. 
 
This announcement has been provided to the ASX under the authorisation of the S2 Board.

Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling 
(e.g. cut channels, random chips, 
or specific specialised industry 
standard measurement tools 
appropriate to the minerals 
under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be 
taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
Sampling Techniques carried out by Outback Goldfields 
Australia Pty Ltd (“OGA”) are reported as follows; 
Reverse circulation drill samples were collected in 1 metre 
intervals down hole from surface to end of hole for all 
holes drilled. A representative sample of each 1 metre 
interval was collected in chip trays as drilling was 
undertaken, as well as a larger sample (nominally 1.5kg) 
which was retained for additional testing where required. 
Diamond Drill core was sampled to honour boundaries of 
key lithologies and mineralisation on nominally 0.8m 
intervals. Samples were cut in half using an Almonte core 
saw along the vertical axis of the core based on Orientation 
lines. One half of the sample was submitted for laboratory 
analysis, with half retained for future reference. 
Soil samples were collected using a hand auger. Sampling 
staff selected approximately 100g of material from the B-C 
soil horizon interface. A subset of this sample was collected 
in chip trays for XRF analysis with the remainder stored for 
future reference. 
Sampling techniques carried out by Cape Clear Minerals Pty 
Ltd (“CCM”) and Leviathan Resources Ltd are yet to be 
reviewed by S2 Minerals,S2 is currently in the process of 
validating the results of previous sampling campaigns.

Include reference to measures 
taken to ensure sample 
representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems 
used 
To ensure sample representivity, OGA reports taking the 
following steps; 
RC samples were collected from buckets which collected all 
chips from the sample stream. Grab samples were 
collected from the buckets by hand, collecting material 
from the bottom, middle and top of the sample collected. 
Diamond Drilling samples were cut along the Orientation 
line, to ensure un-biased sampling, sampling staff always 
selected the top half of the core for submission to the 
laboratory, with the bottom half retained for future 
reference.    
Sampling techniques carried out by Cape Clear Minerals Pty 
Ltd (“CCM”) and Leviathan Resources Ltd are yet to be 
reviewed by S2 Minerals, S2 is currently in the process of 
validating the results of previous sampling campaigns. 
 
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material 
to the Public Report.  In cases 
where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be 
relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse 
circulation drilling was used to 
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 
30 g charge for fire assay’). In 
other cases more explanation 
may be required, such as where 
there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (e.g. 
submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information 
OGA report the following:  
Reverse Circulation drill samples were collected in 1 metre 
intervals down hole from surface to end of hole for all 
holes drilled. A representative sample of each 1 metre 
interval was collected in chip trays as drilling was 
undertaken, as well as a larger sample (nominally 1.5kg)

staff selected approximately 100g of material from the B-C 
soil horizon interface and assayed using a portable XRF 
device. A subset of this sample was collected in chip trays 
for XRF analysis with the remainder stored for future 
reference.

circulation, open-hole hammer, 
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, 
depth of diamond tails, face-

whether core is oriented and if 
so, by what method, etc). 
Leviathan Resources Ltd, Cape Clear Minerals Pty Ltd and 
Outback Goldfields Australia Pty Ltd respectively have 
carried out a series of Reverse circulation, Aircore and 
Diamond Drilling campaigns have been completed across 
the Glenfine tenement.  No drilling by S2 has been 
conducted on the tenements.   
Verification and validation of these data sets by S2 is 
ongoing. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
Method of recording and 
assessing core and chip sample 
recoveries and results assessed 
During Drilling operations OGA did not estimate sample 
recoveries for Reverse circulation drill programs. 
For diamond drilling, intervals of “lost core” were recorded 
during logging, amounting to approximately 3% of the total 
meters drilled, subsequently diamond drill core recoveries 
are estimated to be approximately 97%. 
 
Measures taken to maximise 
sample recovery and ensure 
representative nature of the 
samples 
Unknown - no drilling or sampling by S2 has been 
conducted on the tenements.  All drilling on the project is 
historical in nature and verification and validation of these 
data sets are ongoing.    
 
Whether a relationship exists 
between sample recovery and 
grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of 
fine/coarse material. 
OGA reported that no relationship between sample 
recovery and grade had been identified. Noting that whilst 
the mineralised quartz zones intercepted, were more 
fractured than the surrounding sedimentary rocks, they 
were generally quite competent, were not associated with 
an increase in “lost” core.

Logging 
Whether core and chip samples 
have been geologically and 
geotechnically logged to a level 
of detail to support appropriate 
Mineral Resource estimation, 
mining studies and metallurgical 
studies. 
Logging by OGA during its previous exploration campaigns, 
described as follows; 
Reverse circulation samples were logged to sample intervals 
recording lithology, colour, Quartz percentage, and minerals 
observed. 
Diamond Drilling was logged in detail recording detailed 
lithology information to a minimum interval of 10cm, 
recoding lithologies, colour and any observed minerals of 
interest.  
All logging completed by OGA Personnel was supervised by 
experienced Senior Geologists with expansive prior 
experience in the Victorian Goldfields

Sub-sampling techniques are described as follows; 
Reverse circulation/Air core samples were collected in 1 
metre intervals down hole from surface to end of hole for all

Sample preparation methods are considered appropriate in 
the context in which they are used.  
Reverse Circulation/Air Core drilling was undertaken to drill 
holes through shallow tertiary basalt flows to test the top of 
the basement rocks for Geochemical anomalies. Grab 
sampling by hand was considered sufficient to provide a 
representative sample for this purpose. 
Diamond drilling was carried out to identify and define 
potential gold mineralisation. Drill Core sampling using a 
Diamond blade core saw, with intervals adjusted to ensure 
samples represented geology (i.e. not sampling across major 
lithological/mineralisation boundaries) was considered 
representative and appropriate for this purpose. 
S2 is currently in the process of validating the results of 
previous drilling campaigns. 
 
Quality control procedures 
adopted for all sub-sampling 
stages to maximise representivity 
of samples. 
No drilling or sampling by S2 has been conducted on the

All sampling of drill holes by OGA, CCM and Leviathan 
Resources Ltd respectively was supervised by experienced 
Senior geologists with extensive experience in the Victorian 
Goldfields.

Measures taken to ensure that 
the sampling is representative of 
the in situ material collected, 
including for instance results for 
field duplicate/second-half 
sampling. 
No drilling or sampling by S2 has been conducted on the 
tenements.   
OGA have tested sample representativity within their 
drilling campaigns as outlined below; 
Diamond Drill core samples which returned preliminary fire 
assays above 0.4 g/t gold had sample residues re-analysed 
using screen fire assay technique at the Gekko Assay 
Laboratory in Ballarat. A comparison of the results 
determined that whilst some variability was observed due 
to a nuggetty gold distribution, the variances observed were 
not significant enough to hinder the companies ability to 
identify significant gold mineralsiation. Half core from all 
diamond drill holes has been retained and is available for 
second half sampling should this be deemed necessary in 
the future.  
Verification by S2 of previous exploration results is currently 
ongoing. 
 
Whether sample sizes are 
appropriate to the grain size of 
the material being sampled. 
OGA regularly reviewed the results of it’s sampling 
programs. The company formed the view that the sample 
sizes selected offered a good balance of providing a 
representative sample for analytical purposes, whilst still 
retaining a useful sample of the core for future studies.  
The submission of nominally 1.5kgsamples for any samples 
selected for analysis for gold is considered sufficiently 
representative of the material sampled. 
Verification by S2 of previous exploration results is currently 
ongoing.

Data spacing for reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
Traverses of Air core drillholes have been completed on 80 - 
100m spacing to test the top of basement Geochemistry 
across the interpreted positions of buried Cambrian Basalt 
dome margins. based on analysis of soil sampling data 
collected across known lines of mineralisation in the Historic 
goldfields of Bendigo and Ballarat.  
Geochemical anomalies associated with mineralisation in 
these goldfields was observed to vary between 400m and 
1km in width, a 100m spaced drill pattern should clearly 
identify anomalous geochemical zones in typical Victorian 
Gold systems. 
Diamond drilling at the Glenfine Consolidated and Reef 2 
prospects has been completed on fans approximately 200m
