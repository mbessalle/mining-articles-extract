Earning into Highly Prospective Project at Mt Clere Containing a
Large SEDEX/IOCG Drill-Ready Anomaly
Mt Clere Earn-In Agreement Highlights:
• ZMI to acquire up to an 80% interest in EL 52/3979 located at the highly prospective Mt
Clere Project in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia.
• The Mt Clere Project (75km2) is located within the Edmund Basin on Mt Clere Station,
190km north-northwest of Meekatharra and 725km north-east of Perth in Western
Australia, with road access to the Project.
• Large-scale 1km wide geophysical anomaly with strong magnetic (400nT) and gravity
(~2mG) signatures remains untested by drilling, representing a rare exploration
opportunity in Western Australia (Figure 1).
• BHP exploration tried to drill the target in the 1990’s and terminated the hole at 56m
(depth) due to drilling issues, with the anomaly remaining untested, with recent
geophysical work having significantly enhanced the anomaly’s prospectivity (see pg. 4).
• The target lies adjacent to the Mt Clere fault, within a copper and base metal province
which hosts various copper and base metal prospects and mines.
• An existing Heritage Agreement is in place and drill planning is underway with a
Programme of Work (POW) to be lodged imminently.

ZMI’s Non-Executive Chairman, Peter Huljich, commented:
“The Mount Clere Project presents a standout, drill-ready geophysical target, which we believe
is one of the last of its kind in Western Australia. This bullseye anomaly, marked by a distinct
400nT magnetic signature and a coincident 2mGal gravity anomaly, mirrors the geophysical
fingerprints of major discoveries. BHP tried to drill this target in the 1990s but was forced to
abandon the attempt due to technical challenges, leaving its full potential untapped.
Thanks to cutting-edge geophysical advancements, our understanding of this anomaly has
dramatically improved. Its scale and characteristics align with globally significant SEDEX and
IOCG deposits, such as the world-class Sullivan and Ernest Henry mines.
Western Australia has a proven track record of game-changing discoveries driven by
geophysics. Given the Mount Clere anomaly’s compelling geological setting and geophysical
features, we are eager to put drill bits in the ground and unlock its true potential.”

Zinc of Ireland NL (ASX: ZMI) (ZMI or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has executed
a binding agreement to acquire a highly prospective drill ready project at Mt Clere, in the
Gascoyne region of Western Australia, containing a high tenor, coincident magnetic and
gravity geophysical target (Mt Clere Earn-In Agreement).
The Mount Clere Project is located 725km north-northeast of Perth and 190km north-
northwest of the town of Meekatharra in Western Australia (Figure 2).
Regional Geological Setting
E52/3979 (Tenement) overlies a portion of the southern margin of the Mesoproterozoic
Edmund Basin which forms the lower portion of the larger combined 1680-1067 Ma Edmund
and Collier Basins formerly known as the Bangemall Basin. The Edmund Group sediments,
comprising the Edmund Basin, are younger than 1680 Ma granites of the underlying Gascoyne
Province and older than 1465 Ma dolerite sills that intrude the Edmund Group sediments.
From the base upwards the stratigraphy of the Edmund Basin is comprised of, basal coarse
sandstones and conglomerate (Mount Augustus Sandstone and Yilgatherra Formation),
dolomitic siltstones (Irregully Formation), sandstones (Kiangi Creek Formation), chert
(Discovery Formation), dolomitic siltstones (Devil Creek and Ullawarra Formations). Numerous
late-stage dolerite sills intrude the sequence.
Local Geological Setting
The Mt Clere Project is located near the centre-north of the GSWA Robinson Range 1:250,000
scale map sheet SG5007 and northwest corner of the Marquis 1:100,000 scale map sheet 2447.
The GSWA surface geological mapping indicates extensive Cainozoic sediment cover
throughout the Project area with limited outcrop of basement Proterozoic rock. Minor
Mesoproterozoic Nanular Member siltstone and sandstone outcrops are located along strike
to the east and west of the priority target area, and there are minor outcrops of
Mesoproterozoic Discovery Formation chert and siltstone and Kiangi Creek Formation
siltstones, shales and sandstones (host to the Abra base metal deposit) to the north. The
mapped Mesoproterozoic units strike east-west and dip at an approximate angle of 70° to the
south in the area of the priority target. No magnetic lithologies are mapped within the Mt Clere
Project area, although Proterozoic dolerite dykes and sills are intruded into the Kiangi Creek
Formation sediments to the east, which produce linear magnetic anomaly highs following the
sedimentary stratigraphy. Therefore, it is likely that linear east-west trending magnetic
anomaly highs extending across the Mt Clere Project are also caused by Proterozoic dolerite
dykes and sills. The sources of magnetic and gravity anomaly highs within the priority target
area are likely hosted in Mesoproterozoic rocks sitting below Cainozoic cover sediments.
No existing drillhole data is currently available to confirm the thickness of Cainozoic cover
sediments or to otherwise assist with constraining the depth of the Robin 21priority magnetic
and gravity anomaly target (Robin 21).

Previous Exploration
BHP explored an area encompassing the Tenement from 1996-1998. BHP was targeting large
sedimentary-hosted base metal deposits which included Abra-style Pb-Ag-Cu-Au deposits.
BHP completed a limited BLEG stream sediment sampling programme which did not provide
results warranting further exploration. However, a regional airborne magnetic survey
identified a bullseye magnetic target, named “Robin 21” that was a similar size to the Abra
magnetic anomaly. A more detailed helicopter-borne magnetic survey revealed the Robin 21
bullseye magnetic anomaly to cover an area of 800m x 600m and have an amplitude of 300nT.
One vertical RC drillhole, 97JW17, drilled to test the magnetic target intersected Recent-
Cenozoic alluvium (sand, silt and clay) before being abandoned at 56m with the anomaly itself
untested.*
More recently, the Vendor completed a ground-based gravity survey during February 2022.
The gravity survey data was collected on a 200m x 200m grid over the priority magnetic
anomaly target and surrounds. An example of the gridded Bouguer anomaly data is shown as
a pseudo-colour image over a filtered greyscale magnetic anomaly image background
(TMIRTP-1VD) in Figure 3 below.
An airborne magnetic, radiometric and digital terrain model (DTM) survey was also completed
over part of the Mt Clere Project area during April 2022.
In mid-2022, Resource Potentials Pty Ltd completed unconstrained 3D inversion modelling of
airborne magnetic and ground gravity data for the Mount Clere Project, Figures 4a and 4b.
In comparison to the BHP-era data, the combined 2022 geophysical programmes have acted
to enhance the veracity of the Robin 21 target via:
• confirmation of the geophysical anomaly;
• an increase in the footprint of the target from 800m to 1000m as seen in 2D plan view;
• increasing the apparent gravity relative gravity response to 2mGal from the BHP era 1
mGal;
• increasing the apparent magnetic response from 300nT to 400nT; and
• agreement between variations in the 2022 magnetic modelling techniques that the
top of the anomaly may sit as shallow as 100m deep (a single BHP hole abandoned at
56m).
*The results from BHP’s exploration are not presented here as they are not considered material and have been superseded by recent geophysical surveys
that are reported herein.

Magnetic 3D Inversion Modelling
Unconstrained magnetic 3D inversion modelling was carried out on a windowed area of the
2022 100m line-spaced airborne magnetic survey data using Geosoft VOXI inversion code (eg
Fig 3a). Alternative magnetic unconstrained 3D inversion models was generated using 1)
standard magnetic susceptibility inversion, whereby all of the measured local magnetic field
is assumed to be caused by induced magnetisation and 2) magnetic vector inversion (MVI),
which attempts to account for possible magnetic remanence. The primary output and data
product for both of these 3D inversions are 3D block models of the Earth’s magnetic
susceptibility contrast with the pre-defined sub-surface 3D block model area. The standard
magnetic susceptibility model is located directly below the airborne magnetic TMIRTP
anomaly high features and model features tend to dip inwards into the center of the TMIRTP
anomaly, whereas the MVI 3D inversion model features are focused on the outer edges of the
airborne magnetic TMIRTP anomaly and tend to dip outwards away from the center of the
TMIRTP anomaly.
There is a significant difference in the orientation of magnetic anomaly source bodies resolved
by the standard magnetic susceptibility and MVI unconstrained 3D inversion models, and at
this stage it is not possible to determine which model may be more accurately representing
the magnetic sources. At this stage, the magnetic 3D inversion model results obtained using
the standard magnetic susceptibility inversion are preferred and have been considered in
preliminary drillhole design.
Although the orientation of the modelled magnetic anomaly sources bodies is very different
between the alternative 3D inversions, the depth to the top of the magnetic model bodies is
similar, at approximately 100m.
Gravity 3D Inversion Modelling
Unconstrained gravity 3D inversion modelling (Figure 4b above) was carried out on the 2022
Mt Clere ground gravity survey data using Geosoft VOXI inversion code. The primary output
and data product for this inversion is a 3D block model of the Earth’s density contrast with the
pre-defined sub surface 3D block model volume. The gravity 3D inversion block model
dimensions were defined based on the gravity Bouguer anomaly grid area and data resolution,
and comprised of mesh cells with dimensions 100m (X), 100m (Y) and 25m (vertical) from
surface down to a depth of 1,285m RL (approximately 1,700m total vertical extent). The depth
to the top of the gravity 3D inversion model features having higher amplitude positive density
contrast is approximately 300m, which is deeper than the magnetic model bodies. This could
represent a similar geological setting to Abra where the magnetic anomaly is due to the
magnetite zone within the upper apron portion of the deposit and the gravity anomaly is due
to hematite alteration and base metal mineralisation within the upper apron plus the
underlying feeder zone.

Interpretation and Proposed Drillhole
The north-east orientation of the magnetic feature is considered significant as this structural
direction is thought to represent large-scale underlying tectonic ‘transfer” structures (in some
cases, tectonic zones between terranes). The magnetic threshold is on par with the
surrounding magnetic trends in lithologies as is the gravity. A magnetite destruction halo may
be indicative of alteration. The geophysical feature is located on the structurally complex
boundaries between the reworked Archaean (Palaeo to Meso Proterozoic reworking) and the
older Archaean basement.
At this stage, a primary initial drillhole has been designed to intersect the modelled sources of
both the magnetic and gravity anomalies for the priority target within the Mt Clere Project.
Subject to ongoing assessment a priority initial drillhole is proposed. The standard
unconstrained VOXI 3D inversion model source bodies for the priority target are generally
dipping to the south, which is in-line with the expected sedimentary host layer dip based on
geological mapping in the Project area. Therefore, the proposed drillhole is directed towards
the north-northwest and aimed at testing a deeper part of the magnetic 3D inversion model
and the upper part of the gravity 3D inversion model bodies. The proposed initial drillhole is
expected to intersect the deeper source of the gravity anomaly between 250 to 300m
downhole. The magnetic and gravity anomaly images and contours have been used to assist
the drillhole design, and drill testing of the peak of the residual filtered gravity Bouguer
anomaly peak has been prioritized (Figures 5 and 6 below).

Berma’s right to acquire a 10% interest in the Tenement from the Vendor arises during or upon
completion of Stage 1 of the Earn-In Period.
ZMI has agreed to issue the deferred consideration shares within its placement capacity
pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.1. However, in circumstances where ZMI’s VWAP drops below
$0.0072, resulting in ZMI no longer having sufficient capacity to issue the deferred
consideration shares, ZMI would be in breach of its Listing Rule 7.1 placement capacity and
would therefore not be able to issue the deferred consideration securities.
The Vendor and Berma’s remaining 20% interest in the Tenement (should Berma elect to
acquire a 10% interest in the Tenement from the Vendor during or on completion of Stage 1)
will be free carried by ZMI, which will sole fund all costs incurred in connection with exploration
on and development of the Tenement, until such time that:
(a) a Bankable Feasibility Study on the Tenement is completed and presented to the
Vendor and Berma; and
(b) financing from a reputable financial institution or other debt, equity and / or
royalty or alternative finance provider is secured in relation to the Tenement,
following which the Vendor and Berma will be required to elect to either fund their share
of all costs incurred in connection with exploration on and development of the Tenement
or have their remaining interest in the Tenement diluted to a royalty on standard terms.
The Mt Clere Earn-In Agreement may be terminated upon the Company electing not to
proceed with exploration of the Tenement across the Earn-In Period, with the parties
otherwise being entitled to terminate the Mt Clere Earn-In Agreement in writing, and in those
circumstances, the parties will be released from their obligations under the Terms Sheet.
The Mt Clere Earn-In Agreement is otherwise on standard terms for an agreement of this kind.

programme (n = 5) of a single drainage in the far east of E52/1060
(outside of the Tenement). This sampling provided no
encouragement. A regional airborne magnetic survey identified a
bullseye magnetic target, named “Robin 21” that was a similar size
and slightly lower amplitude to the Abra magnetic anomaly. The
Robin 21 magnetic target underlay Nanular Creek flood plain
sediments close to the creek’s intersection with the Gascoyne River.

One vertical RC drillhole, Hole#97JW17, drilled to test the magnetic
target intersected 56m of Recent-Cenozoic alluvium (sand, silt and
clay) before being abandoned. The hole was abandoned because of
difficulty of drilling the Nanular Creek flood plain alluvium and was not

the airborne magnetic anomaly by BHP downgraded the prospectivity
of the magnetic target. No further work was completed. There is no
