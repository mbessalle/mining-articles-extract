be subdivided area of the Mount Sainthill Exploration License.
Commenting on the sale agreement, Investigator’s Managing Director, Andrew McIlwain said:
“During a conversation with Tivan’s Head of Northern Australia at the NT Resources Conference
that I recently attended in Darwin, the fluorite potential on the Mt Sainthill EL that surrounds the
Molyhil project was discussed.
“Tivan are advancing the Speewah fluorite project, Australia’s only JORC fluorite resource and
hold tenements north of the Mt Sainthill EL, which they refer to as their Sandover Project, with
fluorite identified close to the northern boundary of the Mt Sainthill EL.
“Fluorite mineralisation, first discovered in 1970, occurs on the Mt Sainthill EL, and a number of
the Mining Leases associated with historic production remain.

“The deal with Tivan came together quickly and has provided opportunity to maximise the fluorite
potential within the region for Tivan, whilst maintaining Investigator’s ability to explore for other
commodities. Tivan have been respectful of Investigator’s desire to maintain and pursue the tung-
sten opportunities in the area and present as a company with similar goals as Investigator in max-
imising the development opportunities in this under-explored region of the Territory.
“Importantly, the cash consideration enables Investigator to continue to pursue its key exploration
and development objectives”.

Leases (MLs) 33903, 33904, 33905, 79 and 86 to ASX listed Tivan Limited.
Consideration for the sale of the subdivided area is structured around a number of milestones
including:
• execution of the sale agreement;
• formal registration of the new subdivided tenement in Tivan’s name, anticipated in early
2025;
• upon declaration of a JORC compliant resource by Tivan; and finally
• on commencement of any fluorite production from the area.

(ASX & AIM:THR) hold part ownership of the Mt Sainthill EL, a portion of the consideration will be
paid to Thor. Appropriately, Thor is a signatory to this sale agreement.
The split of the consideration between Investigator and Thor is as follows:
Milestone Investigator Thor
Execution $400,000 $50,000
Title transfer $50,000 $50,000
JORC Resource $250,000 $50,000
Production $175,000 $50,000
TOTAL $875,000 $200,000
The sale agreement reflects terms and conditions that are common for this type of transaction.
Commodity Focus Retained
The sale agreement provides for development of a “Mineral Sharing Agreement” that recognises
the specific and mutually exclusive mineral focus of both companies.
The Mineral Sharing Agreement will enable Investigator access to undertake exploration for all
minerals, other than fluorite, on the divested portion of the tenement (blue hatched area in Figure
2 below), with a reciprocal right allowing Tivan to explore for fluorite in an area on the Northern
boundary of the Mt Sainthill EL, shown as the green hatched area in Figure 2 below.
Importantly, the boundary of the proposed subdivision does not impact on the area associated
with the Molyhil Tungsten Project, the associated infrastructure corridors, nor the near mine ex-
ploration targets identified by Investigator that will be drilled following formal completion of Native
Title clearance surveys undertaken in October.
