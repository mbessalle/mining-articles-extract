Recent Review Highlights Potential Scale of Copper VMS System:
Mt Mulcahy hosts a significant Cu-Zn-Ag-Au-Co resource in VMS 
stratigraphy similar to Golden Grove
Existing resource of 647,000 tonnes @ 2.4% Cu, 1.8% Zn, 0.1% Co, 
and 20g/t Ag identified at South Limb Pod
Recent review highlights multiple untested VTEM conductors within 
13.5km strike zone
Clearances completed for follow up drilling
Potential divestment / farm-out opportunity

Advanced Targets Recently Identified, Significant Exploration 
Potential:
Largely untested 50km strike zone of LCT pegmatites within the 
Project, including extensive LCT pegmatite swarms at Poona East 
and Poona West prospects (refer ASX release 20 October 2022).
Recent RC drilling intersected highly fractionated complex LCT 
pegmatites, field reconnaissance has identified multiple follow-up 
targets (refer ASX release 22 April 2024). Historic surface sampling 
has returned high-grade values up to 2.99% Li2O/
LCT pegmatites are oriented subparallel to the granite contact and 
are shallow dipping to the north (Poona East) and northeast (Poona 
West). Individual pegmatites are up to 1000m long and surface 
exposures suggest widths from 10m to 15m wide. Shallow dipping 
pegmatite orientation is a characteristic of significant LCT pegmatite 
systems.
Further RC drill testing of Poona targets planned following additional 
heritage clearing to allow access to expanded pegmatite target area.
