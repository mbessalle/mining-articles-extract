ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
14 February 2025 
 
 
 
 
 
Scorpion Minerals to Farm Into Jungar Flats 
 
 
E79 Gold has entered into an Earn-In and Joint Venture Heads of 
Agreement with Scorpion Minerals Limited (ASX: SCN) over the Jungar 
Flats Project in Western Australia. 
 
The Earn-In and Joint Venture Agreement (Jungar Flats JV) will allow 
E79 Gold to focus on near-term discovery opportunities at: 
o E79 Gold’s Laverton South Project, especially the Pinjin tenure 
adjacent to the recent Lighthorse gold discovery; and 
o The Mountain Home IOCG Copper-Gold Project in the McArthur 
Basin of the Northern Territory. 
 
West Australian-based explorer E79 Gold Mines Limited (ASX: E79) (‘E79 Gold’ or 
‘the Company’) is pleased to advise that it has entered into an Earn-In and Joint 
Venture Heads of Agreement for the Jungar Flats Project in the Murchison Region 
of Western Australia.  
E79 Gold CEO, Ned Summerhayes, said: “We are pleased to have secured this farm-
in arrangement with Scorpion Minerals at Jungar Flats. This agreement delivers several 
positive outcomes for our shareholders; We reduce our expenditure commitments 
while remaining exposed to any exploration success going forward, with the JV allowing 
us to focus on our 100%-owned near-term discovery opportunities at the Laverton 
South (WA) and Mountain Home (NT) Projects. 
“We look forward to working with the Scorpion Minerals team going forward. They have 
a track-record of discovery and the Murchison assets will benefit from being a part of 
a larger-scale regional play.”

The Jungar Flats Project 
The Jungar Flats Project is located in the Murchison goldfields of Western Australia.  
The project covers 698km2 and is comprised of the following eight tenements; 
 
o 
100% owned by E79 Gold subsidiaries; E51/1975, E51/1803, E51/1848, 
E20/0926, E51/2122, E51/2173 and E51/2174; and 
o 
100% of Mineral Rights (Excluding Iron Rights) E51/1681  
(A subsidiary of iron ore miner Fenix Resources Ltd (ASX:FEX) (Fenix) owns 
E51/1681 and the Iron Rights) 
 
The key terms of the agreement include: 
o 
Fenix to approve the assignment in relation to E51/1681, and Scorpion 
Minerals, E79 and Fenix entering into a deed of covenant in respect of 
E51/1681; 
o 
Scorpion Minerals will be the manager of the Project; 
o 
An upfront cash payment of $100,000 to E79 Gold; 
o 
Scorpion granted a right to earn 51% of the project by spending 
$1,500,000 on exploration in the first three years of signing the agreement 
(including the upfront cash payment) (Stage 1); 
o 
Scorpion Minerals may earn an additional 19% (increasing to a 70% 
interest) by spending a further $1,500,000 on exploration within 5 years 
of signing the agreement (Stage 2);  
o 
Upon either Stage 1 completion (if Scorpion Minerals does not exercise its 
right for Stage 2 or fails to achieve Stage 2 completion) or Stage 2 
completion, the parties will establish an unincorporated joint venture in 
respect of the tenements (Joint Venture). Each party can then elect to 
contribute or dilute its’ respective interest; 
o 
Scorpion may elect to withdraw from the agreement prior to the Stage 1 
end date provided it has expended at least $300,000 on the tenements 
within a one-year period after the agreement execution date.

This opportunity allows E79 Gold to technically and financially focus on other 
near-term discovery opportunities as outlined below. 
Laverton South Gold Project   
Lake Yindana (100%) and Pinjin (100%) 
The Laverton South Gold Project, with an area of 272km2, covers a southern 
portion of the Laverton Tectonic Zone (‘LTZ’) approximately 130km east-northeast 
of Kalgoorlie, within the major gold producing Archean Yilgarn Craton of Western 
Australia. 
Neighbouring company, Kalgoorlie Gold Mining Ltd (ASX: KAL) (KalGold) has 
recently released significant assay results from drilling at an emerging greenfields 
gold discovery called Lighthorse, in a structure parallel to the LTZ3.   
The discovery sits to the west of KalGold’s Kirgella Gift/Providence deposits 
(2.34Mt @ 1.0g/t Au for 76,400 ounces1) and to the immediate east of E79 Gold’s 
tenure, see Figure 2).   
The recently announced drilling results by KalGold returned thick, shallow zones 
of gold mineralisation with results including2,3: 
o 8m @ 2.29g/t Au from 60m (KGAC24045) – located ~40m from the 
E79 Gold/KalGold tenement boundary; and  
o 17m @ 4.81g/t Au from 48m (KGAC24152) – ~550m from the E79 
Gold/KalGold tenement boundary. 
The discovery holes at Lighthorse are interpreted by KalGold to define a zone of 
mineralisation up to 600m long and 200m wide under transported cover, which is 
open both at depth and along strike.  
This new ‘blind’ discovery sits between 40m and 550m east of E79 Gold’s Pinjin 
Project (Figure 2).   
E79 Gold is in advanced planning to aircore drill test these targets in the coming 
months.

Northern Territory IOCG Copper-Gold Project 
Mountain Home (EL32470 – NT Minerals Option), EL33886 and EL33887 - 100% 
E79)  
E79 Gold controls an area of 868km2 within the highly prolific McArthur Basin in 
the Northern Territory. The Project covers inliers of highly prospective lithology of 
the McArthur Basin, within the younger Carpentaria Basin. Within the project, the 
MH Gossan has returned high-grade copper, gold and bismuth assays from rock 
chips along it’s 1,000m outcropping strike. Rock chip assay results include values 
of up to 45.5% copper, 11.75 g/t gold and 9.09% bismuth 4. 
E79 Gold is advancing preparations to undertake initial drilling under the MH 
Gossan, with regulatory approvals well underway, with drilling planned in the 
upcoming dry season (May-November).
