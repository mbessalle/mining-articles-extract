Scorpion Minerals Limited (ASX:SCN) (Scorpion, SCN or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has entered into
a binding farm-in and joint venture heads of agreement (“Heads of Agreement”) with E79 Exploration Pty Ltd, a
wholly owned subsidiary of E79 Gold Mines Ltd (ASX:E79) (“E79”) to acquire a majority stake in E79’s Jungar Flats
Gold Project in the Murchison region of Western Australia (“Project”).
The Heads of Agreement provides for Scorpion to earn up to a 70% interest in the Project, by expenditure of
$3,000,000 over a 5-year period including a cash consideration of $100,000 and expenditure milestones.
The Jungar Flats Project abuts Scorpion’s existing 100% owned Pharos Project to the east (Figure 1), together
taking in the northern extent of the highly prospective Big Bell–Dalgaranga shear corridor.
In conjunction with the acquisition of the Project, Scorpion has received binding commitments from sophisticated
and professional investors to raise $1.5 million (before costs) via the issue of 75,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares
at $0.02 per share (“Placement”). The issue price represents a 33% premium to the last traded price of the
Company’s securities of $0.015 per share.
Key contractors and related parties of the Company will also convert:
(a) $332,000 of trade payables via the issue of 16,600,000 fully paid ordinary shares at the same issue price
(“Debt-to-Equity Conversion”); and
(b) $200,000 for drilling services via the issue of 10,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares at the same issue price
(“Drill-to-Equity Conversion”).
Subject to shareholder approval, participants in the Placement, Debt-to-Equity Conversion and Drill-to-Equity
Conversion will receive free attaching unlisted options on a 1:2 basis, exercisable at $0.04 per share and with an
expiry date one (1) year from the date of issue. Participation of Directors in the Debt-to-Equity Conversion is also
subject to shareholder approval.
Funds raised will be used to accelerate explora(cid:415)on across several high-grade targets within the Company’s
Murchison gold por(cid:414)olio, including the considera(cid:415)on payable to E79 in respect of the Heads of Agreement, for
general working capital, and to evaluate other project opportuni(cid:415)es as they arise.
Commenting on the expanded ground position and Scorpion’s near-term plans, CEO Michael Fotios said: “We
are delighted to have executed this strategic agreement with E79, which now makes Scorpion the largest
landholder along the highly prospective Big Bell–Dalgaranga shear corridor in the Murchison – one of the prime
gold exploration jurisdictions in Australia.
With the Murchison region gaining recent attention due to exciting gold discoveries made by neighbouring
companies such as Spartan Resources and Caprice Resources, our plans to accelerate exploration across our high-
grade target areas has been very well received by existing shareholders and new investors. As a result, we have
received commitments to raise $1.5M which will fund the near-term drilling campaigns at Pharos and cover
consideration payable to E79 for the HOA.
With drilling contractors already secured, we plan to have rigs mobilised by the end of February with drilling to
commence shortly thereafter. In a strengthening gold environment, we anticipate a strong pipeline of news flow
over the coming months as activity increases and exploration results come to hand.”
Jungar Flats / Pharos Gold Project Overview
The Jungar Flats Project comprises eight explora(cid:415)on licences located in the Murchison region of Western Australia,
as listed in Appendix 1 (“Tenements”). Seven of the Tenements are held by subsidiaries of E79. The remaining
Tenement E51/1681 is held by a subsidiary of iron ore miner Fenix Resources Ltd (ASX:FEX) (“Fenix”), with E79

holding all gold and mineral rights in respect of E51/1681. Scorpion’s Pharos project covers an area of about
900km2 adjacent to the Dalgaranga-Big Bell Shear Corridor in the prolific Murchison Gold Province of Western
Australia. E79’s Jungar Flats project covers an area of about 700km2 and abuts Pharos to the east for a total holding
of 1600km2 (Figure 1).
The JV agreement creates a cohesive project that is the largest holding in the region straddling a strike of about
60km along the shear corridor and related NW splays.

Historic exploration was fragmented, non-systematic and conducted by numerous companies over a period from
1980 to around 2000. There has been little, or no exploration conducted in the last 25 years. Exploration included
geological mapping, wide spaced RAB assisted geochemical drilling and minor diamond drilling. The main
Dalgaranga-Big Bell shear corridor remains untested and to the south hosts the Big Bell gold Mine (Westgold) and
the recent Never-Never and Pepper high-grade gold discoveries at Dalgaranga (Spartan).
The area is primarily prospective for gold, however potential also exists for copper and lithium mineralisation
(Figure 2). Notwithstanding the nature of the historic exploration significant gold mineralisation was intersect by
shallow RAB drilling within the weathering profile and by diamond drilling in fresh rock below 100m depth (Figures
3 to 5 and Table 1).

No follow up drilling of these targets was completed and will be the focus of an RC program tes(cid:415)ng these and
exis(cid:415)ng high-grade targets at Pharos commencing late February – early March. In addi(cid:415)on, orienta(cid:415)on soil
geochemical sampling will be completed over all targets followed by a regional program to further delineate
exis(cid:415)ng targets and delineate new targets beneath shallow cover.
Poona Tungsten
A recent review of historic soil and rock chip geochemical data has iden(cid:415)fied anomalies west of the historic
Watkins tungsten prospect and in some case adjacent to significant gold soil anomalies (Figures 6 and 7). Given
the recent demand and price surge for tungsten the Poona Rare Metal corridor area will be thoroughly evaluated
for Tungsten mineralisa(cid:415)on. Ini(cid:415)al work will include mapping rock chip sampling and soil geochemistry followed
by RC drill tes(cid:415)ng of selected targets

About Scorpion Minerals Limited
Scorpion Minerals Limited (ASX:SCN) is an Australian mineral exploration and resource development company with a focus on
creating wealth for shareholders through the discovery of world-class deposits, over a diversified range of minerals. Our
current efforts are centred on our Pharos Project, located in the Murchison Province of Western Australia.
The Pharos Project
The Pharos Project consists of 924 square kilometres of granted tenure, located approximately 50 km northwest of the small
mining town of Cue in the Murchison Mineral Field. The project is easily accessible from the Great Northern Highway by the
sealed Jack Hills Mine access road and then by unsealed tracks. Scorpion holds a 100% interest in the project.
The project is prospective for gold, lithium, PGE-Ni-Cu, iron ore, and VMS hosted Cu-Zn-Ag Au mineralisation, and contains the
Mt Mulcahy deposit. The ‘South Limb Pod’ zone of mineralisation at Mt Mulcahy contains a JORC 2012 Measured, Indicated
and Inferred Resource of 647,000 tonnes @ 2.4% copper, 1.8% zinc, 0.1% cobalt and 20g/t Ag (refer Table 3).

sampled. duplicated to control for sampling biases in the field. This was via taking a second conical split replicate off
the rig. Every 20th composite sample is duplicated in the field and submitted for assay. 2 samples from

analysis of laboratory performance, but results are within acceptable deviations from published values.
 Venus Metals, 2016 – 2020, Soil Sampling, all samples were dry at the time of sampling and soil samples
were sieved using a hand-held sieve with a 2mm aperture. No specific quality control was adopted as part
of this reconnaissance programme. The sample size is considered appropriate for the targeted pegmatite
hosted Li-Ta mineralization. RC Drilling, drill samples were collected for each meter using a rig-mounted
rotary splitter. The RC drill chip samples were sub sampled for 3m composites using the Spear method
(approximately 2-3 kg/ sample) in Calico bags labelled with representative Sample ID’s. 1m samples were
also collected in calico bags using same method and labelled with Sample Ids. The composite and 1m
samples were secured and packed in carton boxes and sent to SGS, Lab Perth.

sampling.
 Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being
sampled. |  E79 Gold Mines Limited, 2023, Auger Drilling, refer E79 ASX Releases 17/5/2023, 28/9/2023

o No field duplication undertaken to date, further work planned
o Sample sizes considered appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled
 Emetals Limited, 2020 – 2021, RC Drilling, composite samples were taken via scooping of 4 single metre
samples to achieve 2-4k g sample weight. Single metre RC samples were split on the rig using a conical
splitter into calico bags which is the most repeatable splitting method for RC chip samples. Care was taken
to maintain dry samples, and any moist or wet samples were noted in the field. 20th samples were field
duplicated to control for sampling biases in the field. This was via taking a second conical split replicate off
the rig. Every 20th composite sample is duplicated in the field and submitted for assay. 2 samples from
every 100 were commercially available standards. Insufficient analyses exist for a statistically robust
analysis of laboratory performance, but results are within acceptable deviations from published values.
 Venus Metals, 2016 – 2020, Soil Sampling, all samples were dry at the time of sampling and soil samples
were sieved using a hand-held sieve with a 2mm aperture. No specific quality control was adopted as part
of this reconnaissance programme. The sample size is considered appropriate for the targeted pegmatite
hosted Li-Ta mineralization. RC Drilling, drill samples were collected for each meter using a rig-mounted
rotary splitter. The RC drill chip samples were sub sampled for 3m composites using the Spear method
(approximately 2-3 kg/ sample) in Calico bags labelled with representative Sample ID’s. 1m samples were
also collected in calico bags using same method and labelled with Sample Ids. The composite and 1m
samples were secured and packed in carton boxes and sent to SGS, Lab Perth.

Geology  Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. The Company is targeting:
Scorpion Minerals, Pharos Project
 Shear-hosted lode-style gold mineralisation within mafic, ultramafic and felsic volcanics
 Banded Iron Formation (BIF) hosted “Hill 50” style gold replacement deposits
 High grade quartz vein “Day Dawn” style gold mineralisation hosted within dolerite and basalt
 Felsic porphyry-hosted quartz stockwork and ladder vein mineralisation
 Weld Range-style Fe mineralisation
 Archean VMS Cu-Zn-Co-Au-Ag mineralisation
 Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation associated with ultramafic intrusives
E79 Gold Mines Limited, Jungar Flats
 The Jungar Flats Project is located 70 km west of Meekatharra, in the Murchison Province of the Archean
Yilgarn Craton.
 The project area is considered prospective for orogenic gold, copper, PGE, iron and lithium mineralisation.
Significant historical gold production in the Murchison includes the following mines and mining fields –
Meekatharra/Paddys Flat, Bluebird, Big Bell, Cuddingwarra, and Day Dawn/Cue.
 The Jungar Flats Project area covers the interpreted northern extensions of the Big Bell Shear which is
interpreted as an important structural control on the Big Bell gold deposit some 45 km to the southwest.
Lithium is proposed to occur in greenstone belts proximal to fertile granite intrusions.
