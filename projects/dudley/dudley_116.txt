ASX Announcement 
14 October 2024 
 Option to Acquire Highly Prospective 
Lithium Project in South Australia and 
Expansion of Canadian Lithium Portfolio  
Key Points: 
• Option to acquire up to a 90% interest in the highly prospective Dudley Lithium Project 
(Dudley) on Kangaroo Island in South Australia  
• The Dudley Lithium Project contains thick fractionated pegmatites that strike up to six 
kilometres in length and have never been drill-tested. 
• Exploration has commenced at Dudley with surface soil sampling being completed 
across the tenure, with drilling planned to commence later this year once standard 
statutory approvals are received. 
• Trinex has further consolidated its land position in the Northwest Territories, Canada, 
through the acquisition of the East Yellowknife Lithium Project, which will increase 
Trinex’s land position in the region to over 650km2. 
 
Trinex Minerals Limited (ASX: TX3) (Trinex Minerals or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has 
executed binding agreements to acquire: 
(a) (Dudley Project Farm-In) up to a 90% interest in the Dudley Lithium Project in South Australia 
(Dudley Project) by way of a two-stage farm-in (Stage 1 – 51% and Stage 2 – an additional 39%) 
over approximately 4 years (see Figure 1)1; and 
(b) (EYL Project Acquisition) a 100% interest in the mineral claims comprising the East Yellowknife 
Lithium Project (EYL Project) located in the Northwest Territories, Canada2.  
Further details in relation to the Dudley Project Farm-in and the EYL Project Acquisition are set out below. 
Trinex Minerals’ Managing Director, Will Dix said: 
“I am delighted to announce these strategic acquisitions, which expand and strengthen our lithium 
exploration footprint in Australia and Canada. 
“We are pleased to have been able to secure a highly prospective lithium exploration project in South 
Australia, one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. Kangaroo Island is a large land mass with a 
history of mining and a government supportive of exploration and development of mineral resources.  
“The fundamentals of the Dudley Lithium Project are very exciting, hosted in the right geology with historic 
work indicating lithium mineralisation potential. We see the opportunity for a lithium discovery at depth 
where no drilling has been completed. 
“We are also excited to add the EYL Project to our large portfolio in the Northwest Territories, Canada’s 
exciting emerging lithium jurisdiction.”

ASX Announcement 
Dudley Lithium Project – Kangaroo Island, South Australia 
The Dudley Lithium Project is located on Kangaroo Island in South Australia within exploration licence EL 
6892.  The project contains multiple pegmatite systems that are apparent at surface for over 6 kilometres 
in strike extent and up to 80 metres thick at surface. 
The project area has a long history of historical mining for lithium tourmalines and kaolin primarily from 
strongly weathered surface exposures of the Dudley pegmatite, but also from other pegmatites across the 
project. Trenching of the Dudley pegmatite revealed widths of up to 80m. Lithium tourmalines indicate the 
pegmatites are highly fractionated and they are commonly associated with spodumene mineralised 
pegmatites.

ASX Announcement 
Historical exploration at the Dudley Lithium Project by Lithium Australia was restricted to rock chips from 
the limited pegmatite outcrop and float present across the project. The low potassium/rubidium (K/Rb) 
and potassium/caesium (K/Cs) ratios suggest the pegmatites are highly fractionated, which is conducive 
to the presence of spodumene within the pegmatites. Rb and Cs are highly mobile in weathered rock and 
the sampling likely under-estimates the level and extent of the fractionation. Figures 2 and 3 show the 
rock chip results3 4 for K/Rb and K/Cs respectively. 
Field work is currently underway with an initial 1,000 soil sample program planned across the most 
prospective area, to define areas anomalous in Li and pathfinder (Rb Cs Ta) elements. The soils will be 
analysed using the Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) technique provided by SGS, which should be effective in 
detecting the highly mobile elements (Li Rb Cs) within the weathered soil profile. It is expected the soils 
will be more effective at defining anomalous pegmatites than mapping and rock chip sampling, due to the 
lack of outcrop and strong weathering at surface. 
Initial drilling, once statutory approvals have been received, will focus on testing the Dudley pegmatite and 
other anomalous targets identified from the soils program. Drilling will target the pegmatites below the 
weathering profile, expected to be at most 20-30m deep, where potential lithium mineralisation has not 
degraded into clays. The program will consist of a number of holes designed to test the pegmatites both 
along strike and across the interpreted thickest zones well into fresh rock.

ASX Announcement 
For context on the impact of weathering on the exploration model, the Company notes the characteristics 
of the Greenbushes Lithium Deposit (Greenbushes) in Western Australia, operated by Talison Lithium. 
Within the weathering profile at the Greenbushes deposit, spodumene is weathered to clay minerals and 
most of the Li is lost.5   
The Dudley Lithium Project has a similar weathering profile to Greenbushes, with a lateritic duricrust 
overlying a pallid (clay rich) zone, which was the target of historical kaolin clay mining at the Dudley 
pegmatite (Figure 4). It is unlikely for spodumene to survive at surface with the intensive weathering seen 
in the region, while the Li tourmalines are more resistive to weathering and highlight the Li prospectivity of 
the pegmatites in fresh rock.

pegmatite and host metasediments, with the development of lateritic gravel cover. Photo taken looking

Cautionary Statement: Visual estimates of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or 
substitute for laboratory analyses where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal economic 
interest. Visual estimates also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or deleterious 
physical properties relevant to valuations.

The issue of Shares under the various Stages of the farm-in is subject to shareholder approval and all 
Shares will be issued at the higher of the 10-day VWAP of Shares on ASX up to the end of the business 
day before issue, and $0.002 (Floor Price). If shareholder approval is not obtained for the issue of Shares 
to SALi, such payments may be satisfied in cash.   
Any Shares issued to SALi will be subject to voluntary escrow for a period of 6 months from their date of 
issue.  
If TRM completes Stage 2 of the farm-in, a joint venture will be formed with TRM holding a 90% interest 
and SALi holding a 10% interest, with SALi’s 10% share being free carried by TRM until a financial 
investment decision is made to develop a mining operation within the area of the tenement, which decision 
must be based on a feasibility study. 
In the event a joint venture is formed, and a participant’s share is diluted to less than 10%, that participant 
will be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and automatically transferred its remaining 
percentage share to the other participant in exchange for a 1.75% gross value royalty payable on any 
minerals, ores or concentrates extracted from the Dudley Lithium Project. 
The cash payments and minimum expenditure commitments in relation to the farm-in will be funded through 
the Company’s existing cash reserves and a capital raising to be carried out in due course.

ASX Announcement 
EYL Project – Northwest Territories, Canada 
The EYL Project is located in the Northwest Territories in Canada within the mineral claims set out in 
Annexure A (Mineral Claims) and as shown in Figure 5 below.  Combined, the three projects (Lizo, 
Prelude and Lightning) cover over 15,000 hectares of the Yellowknife Pegmatite district and cover a 
similar geological setting to that seen at the Company’s Halo-Yuri Lithium Project in the NWT.The 
Prelude Project is road accessible from Yellowknife and lies in the centre of exploration for lithium in the 
region.  The Lightning Project borders the eastern edge of the Prosperous Granite which is widely 
accepted as the source rock for most of the LCT pegmatites in the Yellowknife Pegmatite Province.  
Lastly, the Lizo Project is approximately 115 kilometres from Yellowknife and borders the fertile Defeat 
Suite Granite.  Recent interpretation of satellite imagery has indicated many pegmatite bodies for follow 
up in the 2025 Canadian summer field season. 
Recently, Li-FT Power (LIFT:TSXV) (Figure 6) released a maiden resource of 50.4 million tonnes grading 
1.0% Li2O from their Yellowknife Lithium Project.  The host pegmatites for this resource are associated 
with the Prosperous Granite adjacent to the Lightning Project. 
As a first pass, detailed satellite imagery will be purchased and interpreted for the Prelude Lake and 
Lightning Projects with an expectation that field work will commence to ground check interpreted 
pegmatites during Q2 2025, early in the Canadian Summer field season.

Annexure B 
JORC Tables 
The following Tables are provided to ensure compliance with the JORC code (2012) edition 
requirements for the reporting of exploration results.   
JORC Table One – Sampling Techniques and data 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary  
Sampling 
techniques 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, 
random chips, or specific specialised industry 
standard measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as down hole 
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken as limiting the 
broad meaning of sampling. 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure 
sample representivity and the appropriate calibration 
of any measurement tools or systems used. 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that 
are Material to the Public Report. 
Historical rock chip samples in figures 
above were originally reported by 
Lithium Australia in: LIT ASX 
Announcement 20 June 2019 – 
Lithium pegmatites identified at Dudley 
prospect, Kangaroo Island, South 
Australia.  
See original Lithium Australia release 
for sampling techniques.  
Drilling 
techniques 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole 
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) 
and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, 
depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what 
method, etc). 
Not applicable as no drilling is 
reported.  
Drill sample 
recovery 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip 
sample recoveries and results assessed. 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and 
ensure representative nature of the samples. 
Whether a relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade and whether sample bias may 
have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of 
fine/coarse material. 
 
Not applicable as no drilling is 
reported.  
Logging 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of 
detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in 
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged. 
Not applicable as no drilling is 
reported..  
 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half 
or all core taken. 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, 
etc and whether sampled wet or dry. 
For all sample types, the nature, quality and 
appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. 
See original Lithium Australia release 
for sampling techniques.

Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary  
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples. 
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is 
representative of the in situ material collected, 
including for instance results for field 
duplicate/second-half sampling. 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain 
size of the material being sampled. 
Quality of assay 
data and 
laboratory tests 
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the 
assaying and laboratory procedures used and 
whether the technique is considered partial or total. 
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF 
instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining 
the analysis including instrument make and model, 
reading times, calibrations factors applied and their 
derivation, etc. 
Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg 
standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory 
checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy 
(ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. 
See original Lithium Australia release 
for sampling techniques.  
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying

data points 
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill 
holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine 
workings and other locations used in Mineral 
Resource estimation. 
Specification of the grid system used. 
Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
Map figures in the release are in 
GDA2020 MGA zone 54 
(EPSG:7854). 
Historical rock chip samples were 
recorded with handheld GPS with a 3-
5m accuracy. Selected sample sites 
have been revisited by Trinex Minerals 
staff and locations validated. 
Data spacing 
and distribution 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient 
to establish the degree of geological and grade 
continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and 
Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and 
classifications applied. 
Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
No drilling has been completed and 
historical sampling is not sufficient for 
Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve 
purposes. 
No compositing has been applied. 
Orientation of 
data in relation 
to geological 
structure 
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves 
unbiased sampling of possible structures and the 
extent to which this is known, considering the deposit 
type. 
If the relationship between the drilling orientation and 
the orientation of key mineralised structures is 
Rock chip samples collected are 
‘point’ samples and relation to 
orientation of structures is unknown.

Drill hole 
Information 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results including a 
tabulation of the following information for all Material drill 
holes: 
o 
Easting and northing of the drill collar 
o 
Elevation of RL (Reduced Level – elevation 
above sea level in metres) of the drill collar 
o 
Dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
Down hole length and interception depth 
o 
Hole length 
Not applicable as no drilling is reported.  
 
 
Data aggregation 
methods 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging 
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations 
(eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of 
high grade results and longer lengths of low grade 
results, the procedure used for such aggregation should 
be stated and some typical examples of such 
aggregations should be shown in detail. 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal 
equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
No data aggregation methods have been 
used. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
These relationships are particularly important in the 
reporting of Exploration Results. 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the 
drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are 
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect 
(eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
Not applicable as no drilling is reported. 
Diagrams 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and 
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any 
significant discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
See Figures in the document for historical 
sample locations. 
Balanced 
reporting 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results 
is not practicable, representative reporting of both low 
and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to 
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. 
 
All relevant information is reported. 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should 
be reported including (but not limited to): geological 
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of 
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating substances. 
No substantial new information is 
available other than that reported above.
