# Provenance Gold Completes Final Option Payment for 100% Interest in White Rock Gold Property in Nevada

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 10, 2024) - Provenance Gold Corp. (CSE: PAU) (OTCQB: PVGDF) (the "**Company** " or "**Provenance** ") is pleased to announce that it has made its final payment of USD $125,000 to Gold Royalty Corp. for total payments of USD $250,000 to acquire 100 percent ownership of the White Rock Gold Property in northeastern Nevada. Gold Royalty Corp. retains a two percent (2%) net smelter royalty (NSR) on the property. The White Rock Property consists of 164 unpatented mineral claims covering a combined area of approximately 1,327 hectares (3,280 acres), located approximately 105 kilometers (65 miles) northeast of Wells, Elko County, Nevada. 

The White Rock property hosts a large shallow, open-ended, low sulphidation gold system which has been defined by 65 historical drillholes and 35 drillholes conducted by Provenance in 2021. The 2021 drilling defined the stratigraphic and structural controls within the extensive central area of sediment-hosted gold mineralization. The target mineralization extends across a 3.2 km by 1.6 km area centered on a complex dome structure that is believed to have formed on the upper plate of a system of thrust faults and is open in all directions. Drilling not only confirmed results from historical drillholes that intersected numerous thick intervals of potentially open-pittable grade gold mineralization, but they also bottomed out in gold mineralization while confirming the Company's new understanding of the structural and stratigraphic controls of the gold mineralization. 

For example, Hole WR-15 was drilled vertically to test disseminated gold mineralization in the sedimentary rocks that host the system. WR-15 returned three large, mineralized intervals; 7.6 m (25 ft) of 1.45 g/t Au, 29 m (95 ft) of 0.636 g/t Au, 53 m (175 ft) of 0.197 g/t Au. The anomalous gold mineralized zones have a cumulate thickness of 91.5 m (300 ft). 

Large target areas to the south of the main target that host strong gold mineralization at surface remain untested. 

Provenance Chairman Rauno Perttu said, "Our White Rock property is a significant gold system in Nevada that is wide open for expansion. Additional infill and step-out drilling could significantly expand the mineralised footprint both along strike and to depth making it a very attractive project for further exploration."

**JV Opportunity**

Under the right structure, the White Rock Property represents an excellent opportunity for a company looking for a top tier exploration project, with strong potential to become a major new gold discovery in an under-explored part of Nevada. While the Company focuses on advancing Eldorado, additional exploration via a partner could allow the Company to realize further potential from the Property.
