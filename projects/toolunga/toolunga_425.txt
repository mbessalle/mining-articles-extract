The district displays geochemical signatures suggesting potential intrusion related systems, including
Intrusion Related Gold (IRG), porphyry, Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) and related deposit styles
(epithermal), with some affinities to the same aged Tennant Creek District (1850 to 1660 Ma
mineralisation event) where high grade Au, Cu and Bi deposits are present (Figure 3).
The Onslow District is under-explored using systematic, modern exploration technologies.
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the project area was targeted by WMC Resources Ltd and ranked
highly for iron-oxide copper-gold potential1. The Toolunga Project includes numerous mineral
occurrences with the regulatory database recording assay results up to 3.1% Cu, 33% Pb, and
125ppm Ag at the Range No. 2 Prospect2. Multiple occurrences in the district include Cu, Cu-base
metals, U (paleochannel), REE, and Bi-Mo-W. Historic prospects were not routinely assayed for Au,
Ag, Bi, W and Sn (refer Appendix 1).
Recent work including regional tectonic studies3 and publicly available geophysical data has also
highlighted several significant targets including the Mt Minnie Prospect, Range Gravity anomaly and
the Ironstone Bore prospect, which are associated with regional base-metal trends and present as
buried magnetic and/or gravity anomalies pending follow up work. The entire project area has
received minimal previous attention with drilling. Due diligence work by Novo has affirmed the
regional potential of this under explored part of Western Australia.
A series of targets have been generated by Novo and OD4R based on current geological
understanding and initial assessment of regional geophysics and open file GSWA geochemical
sampling (Appendix 1):
Large geophysical targets (gravity – magnetic) with surface geochemical support.
Range No. 2 – Historic shaft sunk into a shear zone with peak rock chip samples of 3.1%
Cu, 33% Pb and 125 ppm Ag – not drilled.
Bullajacka Well - Historic Cu-Au occurrence with rock chip results of 6.2% Cu, 0.19 ppm
Au, 94 ppm Ag, 310 ppm Bi and 41 ppm Sb4.
Mt Minnie – kilometre scale coincident magnetic and gravity anomaly in a triple junction
between the Bandee Fault Lithospheric Boundary and the Mindle Shear Zone, with anomalous
As-Cu-Pb-Zn stream samples.
Range North – Strongest Cu soil anomaly in WAMEX dataset for the area, including a peak of
147 ppm Cu5 parallel to a N-S structure.
Historical data and sample results may not be representative of mineralisation in the district. Novo
has not independently validated the public results listed in historic WAMEX reports or the information
included in the DEMIRS database and is therefore not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or
endorsing the results. No assurance can be given that Novo will achieve similar results as part of its
exploration activities at the Toolunga Project.
ESG Criteria
Part of the Cane River Project is situated in the Cane River Conservation Park (Figure 1). The park
was created in 2001 (Reserve Number 46122). The reserve is vested with the Conservation and
Parks Commission and is currently managed by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and
Attractions (DBCA) pursuant to the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 (WA) for the
protection of flora, fauna, landscape and aboriginal cultural heritage. OD4R has developed a detailed
Conservation Management Plan (CMP), in consultation with the DBCA, for activities within the Cane
River Conservation Park, which is pending final acceptance.
Heritage and Native Title
The southern tenements in the Toolunga Project are covered by the Thalanyji People’s Native Title
Determinations (WAD6113/1998 and WCD2008/003) and managed by the Buurabalayji Thalanyji
Aboriginal Corporations RNTBC. Novo is committed to developing strong relationships with the
Traditional Owners of the lands on which it operates through open and honest dealings. It is
anticipated that Novo will meet with the traditional owners in the first quarter of 2025.
The northern section of the combined project area is without a native title claim. This area will be
monitored for the lodgement of a new claim. If a claim is lodged, the same level of consultation as
above will occur with the new representative body/traditional owners to ensure informed consent for
exploration in the area is gained.

(approximately C$41,000) in cash and have an initial farm in period of 12 months.
Following that initial period, if Novo chooses to continue, it will pay OD4R Novo shares to the
value of A$100,000 (currently, approximately C$91,000) for a second farm in period of 12
months.
At completion of the second farm-in period, Novo has the option to terminate the agreement
or exercise the option and form a 70/30 unincorporated joint venture with OD4R, in which
OD4R is free carried until a decision is made to commence commercial mining operations
within the tenements. If the option is exercised, Novo will acquire a 70% interest in the
tenements.

An Exploration Target as defined in the JORC Code (2012) is a statement or estimate of the exploration potential of a
mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement or estimate, quoted as a range of tonnes and a range
of grade (or quality), relates to mineralisation for which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral
Resource. Accordingly, these figures are not Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve estimates as defined in the JORC Code
(2012). The potential quantities and grades referred to above are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient
exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a
Mineral Resource. These figures are based on the interpreted continuity of mineralisation and projection into unexplored
ground often around historical workings. The Exploration Target has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code
(2012). as detailed in the Company’s ASX announcement released on 25 September 2024 (available to view at
www.asx.com.au). The Tonnage range for the exploration target is 1.5Mt to 2.1Mt, the Grade range is 6.6g/t Au to 8.4g/t
Au and the Ounces range from 320koz Au to 570 koz Au. The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new
information that material affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all material
assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the original market announcement continue to apply
and have not materially changed. Dr Christopher Doyle (MAIG) and Dr Simon Dominy (FAusIMM CPGeo; FAIG RPGeo),
are the qualified persons, as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects,
responsible for, and having reviewed and approved, the technical information relating to the exploration target. Dr Doyle

The Turtle historic mine outside the
Novo project tenure comprises some
of the better-known historic
mineralisation, with West Australian
Metals NL and others conducting
significant work including drilling and
detailed mapping at this prospect and
others in the district, providing early
insight in mineralisation style and
tenor.
Normandy Exploration Limited
conducted regional RAB drilling and
acquired additional magnetic data
over the district. Some of the targets
generated from this work are yet to
be tested.
Atlas Iron in 2006 conducted
comprehensive review and write up
of previous work and conducted
significant regional geochemical
sampling in areas not previously
covered. They compiled a
prospectivity map for hydrothermal
activity and developed additional
surface anomalies for follow up
work. |  |  |  |  |  |

at the junction of major tectonic
boundaries of Capricorn Orogen, the
Pilbara Craton, and the Ashburton
and Edmund Basins. The basins lie
unconformably on basement
metasediments and granitoids of the
Gascoyne Province. The project area
is transected by major NE-SW and
N-S striking structures.
