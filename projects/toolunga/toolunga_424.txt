NOVO SECURES STRATEGIC LAND POSITION IN THE
ONSLOW DISTRICT WESTERN AUSTRALIA
HIGHLIGHTS
• Novo strengthens its high-quality, Australian based exploration portfolio by securing a
significant new ground position of approximately 1,520 sq km at the Toolunga Project in
the Onslow District of Western Australia via:
o A binding term sheet granting Novo an option to acquire a 70% interest in OD4 Rocklea
Pty Ltd’s Cane River Project.
o Direct pegging by Novo of 6 new exploration licenses (100% Novo).
• The Toolunga Project is underexplored with prospectivity for precious and base metal
discovery and aligns with Novo’s exploration strategy of exploring for targets with
> 1 Moz Au potential.
• The district has geochemical signatures of Intrusion Related Gold (IRG), porphyry, Iron Oxide
Copper Gold (IOCG) and related deposit styles (epithermal), with some affinities to the same
aged Tennant Creek District.
• The consolidated tenement package contains several historical mining centres and
numerous targets defined by gravity and magnetic anomalies and anomalous surface
geochemistry.
• The Toolunga Project encompasses the junction of major tectonic boundaries including the
Paleoproterozoic Capricorn Orogen near the intersection of the Pilbara Craton and
Ashburton Basin.
• The combined OD4 Rocklea Pty Ltd and pegged Novo ground is located ~80 km northwest
of Black Cat Syndicate’s (ASX: BC8) Paulsens Gold Mine and 70 km southeast of the Onslow
townsite, with excellent access to the area via sealed roads.
• Regional and follow-up exploration campaigns are planned on tenure grant, including
geophysical surveys, mapping and geochemical sampling programs over known targets to
rapidly advance drill targets.
• Novo continues to review opportunities that will compliment the current Western
Australian and Victoria precious and base metals portfolio.
Commenting on the acquisition, Mike Spreadborough, Executive Co-Chairman and Acting
Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are delighted to announce that as part of Novo’s concerted
project generation program and after extensive due diligence, we have pegged new ground
and taken steps to acquire further strategic interests in landholdings in the Onslow District
that we believe have strong exploration potential.
“The Toolunga Project is in a highly prospective and under-explored district with substantial
areas of untested shallow cover where prospectivity for intrusion-related systems is deemed
high. This land package provides Novo with a platform to build a strategic position in the
district, where we can deploy the expertise of our highly experienced exploration team and
deliver on our targeted growth objectives.

Location and Prospectivity
The combined OD4R and pegged Novo ground is located ~80 km northwest of Black Cat Syndicate’s
(ASX: BC8) Paulsens Gold Mine and 70 km southeast of the Onslow townsite, with excellent access to the
area via sealed roads (Figure 2). The tenure targets a range of minerals of particular interest to Novo,
including precious and base metals with particular focus on gold, and will be referred to as the Toolunga
Project.
The Toolunga Project is located at the junction of major tectonic boundaries in the north of Western
Australia and incorporates the Paleoproterozoic Capricorn Orogen near the intersection of the Pilbara
Craton, the Ashburton and Edmund Basins and the Gascoyne Province (Figure 2). The basins lie
unconformably on basement metasediments and granitoids of the Gascoyne Province and the project
area is transected by major NE-SW and N-S striking structures.
The district displays geochemical signatures suggesting potential intrusion related systems, including
Intrusion Related Gold (IRG), porphyry, Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) and related deposit styles
(epithermal), with some affinities to the same aged Tennant Creek District (1850 to 1660 Ma mineralisation
event) where high grade Au, Cu and Bi deposits are present (Figure 3).
4

The Onslow District is under-explored using systematic, modern exploration technologies.
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the project area was targeted by WMC Resources Ltd and ranked highly
for iron-oxide copper-gold potential1. The Toolunga Project includes numerous mineral occurrences with
the regulatory database recording assay results up to 3.1% Cu, 33% Pb, and 125ppm Ag at the Range No.
2 Prospect2. Multiple occurrences in the district include Cu, Cu-base metals, U (paleochannel), REE, and Bi-
Mo-W. Historic prospects were not routinely assayed for Au, Ag, Bi, W and Sn (refer Appendix 1).
Recent work including regional tectonic studies3 and publicly available geophysical data has also
highlighted several significant targets including the Mt Minnie Prospect, Range Gravity anomaly and the
Ironstone Bore prospect, which are associated with regional base-metal trends and present as buried
magnetic and/or gravity anomalies pending follow up work. The entire project area has received minimal
previous attention with drilling. Due diligence work by Novo has affirmed the regional potential of this
under explored part of Western Australia.
A series of targets have been generated by Novo and OD4R based on current geological understanding
and initial assessment of regional geophysics and open file GSWA geochemical sampling (Appendix 1):
• Large geophysical targets (gravity – magnetic) with surface geochemical support.
• Range No. 2 – Historic shaft sunk into a shear zone with peak rock chip samples of 3.1% Cu,
33% Pb and 125 ppm Ag – not drilled.
• Bullajacka Well - Historic Cu-Au occurrence with rock chip results of 6.2% Cu, 0.19 ppm Au,
94 ppm Ag, 310 ppm Bi and 41 ppm Sb4.
• Mt Minnie – kilometre scale coincident magnetic and gravity anomaly in a triple junction
between the Bandee Fault Lithospheric Boundary and the Mindle Shear Zone, with anomalous
As-Cu-Pb-Zn stream samples.
• Range North – Strongest Cu soil anomaly in WAMEX dataset for the area, including a peak of 147
ppm Cu5 parallel to a N-S structure.
Historical data and sample results may not be representative of mineralisation in the district. Novo has
not independently validated the public results listed in historic WAMEX reports or the information
included in the DEMIRS database and is therefore not to be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing
the results. No assurance can be given that Novo will achieve similar results as part of its exploration
activities at the Toolunga Project.
ESG Criteria
Part of the Cane River Project is situated in the Cane River Conservation Park (Figure 1). The park was
created in 2001 (Reserve Number 46122). The reserve is vested with the Conservation and Parks
Commission and is currently managed by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions
(DBCA) pursuant to the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 (WA) for the protection of flora,
fauna, landscape and aboriginal cultural heritage. OD4R has developed a detailed Conservation
Management Plan (CMP), in consultation with the DBCA, for activities within the Cane River Conservation
Park, which is pending final acceptance.
Heritage and Native Title
The southern tenements in the Toolunga Project are covered by the Thalanyji People’s Native Title
Determinations (WAD6113/1998 and WCD2008/003) and managed by the Buurabalayji Thalanyji Aboriginal
Corporations RNTBC. Novo is committed to developing strong relationships with the Traditional Owners
of the lands on which it operates through open and honest dealings. It is anticipated that Novo will meet
with the traditional owners in the first quarter of 2025.
The northern section of the combined project area is without a native title claim. This area will be
monitored for the lodgement of a new claim. If a claim is lodged, the same level of consultation as above
will occur with the new representative body/traditional owners to ensure informed consent for exploration
in the area is gained.

Forward Programs
Regional and follow-up exploration campaigns are planned on tenement grant, including geophysical
surveys, mapping and geochemical sampling programs over known targets to validate historic results and
to rapidly advance drill targets.
Material Cane River Project Option Terms
The key terms of the binding term sheet with Odette Geoscience Pty Ltd and OD4 Rocklea Gold Pty Ltd
(OD4R) regarding the Cane River project are set out below:
- On signing of the agreement, Novo will reimburse OD4R $55,000 (approximately C$50,000) cash for
expenditure incurred to date.
- At grant date of the tenement applications, Novo will pay OD4R, an additional $45,000 (approximately
C$41,000) in cash and have an initial farm in period of 12 months.
- Following that initial period, if Novo chooses to continue, it will pay OD4R Novo shares to the value of
A$100,000 (currently, approximately C$91,000) for a second farm in period of 12 months.
- At completion of the second farm-in period, Novo has the option to terminate the agreement or
exercise the option and form a 70/30 unincorporated joint venture with OD4R, in which OD4R is free
carried until a decision is made to commence commercial mining operations within the tenements. If
the option is exercised, Novo will acquire a 70% interest in the tenements.

ABOUT NOVO
Novo is an Australian based gold explorer listed on the ASX and the TSX focused on discovering standalone
gold projects with > 1 Moz development potential. Novo is an innovative gold explorer with a significant
land package covering approximately 5,500 square kilometres in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,
along with the 22 square kilometre Belltopper project in the Bendigo Tectonic Zone of Victoria, Australia.
Novo’s key project area is the Egina Gold Camp, where De Grey Mining (ASX: DEG) is farming-in to form a
JV at the Becher Project and surrounding tenements through exploration expenditure of A$25 million
within 4 years for a 50% interest. The Becher Project has similar geological characteristics as De Grey’s 12.7
Moz Hemi Project6. Novo is also advancing gold exploration south of Becher in the Croydon JV (Novo 70%:
Creasy Group 30%), after Novo identified gold mineralisation in 2023 exploration drilling at Nunyerry North.
Novo continues to undertake early-stage exploration across its Pilbara tenement portfolio.
Novo has also formed a lithium joint venture with SQM in the Pilbara which provides shareholder exposure
to battery metals.
Novo has a significant investment portfolio and a disciplined program in place to identify value accretive
opportunities that will build further value for shareholders.
Please refer to Novo’s website for further information including the latest corporate presentation.
An Exploration Target as defined in the JORC Code (2012) is a statement or estimate of the exploration potential of a mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement or
estimate, quoted as a range of tonnes and a range of grade (or quality), relates to mineralisation for which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. Accordingly,
these figures are not Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve estimates as defined in the JORC Code (2012). The potential quantities and grades referred to above are conceptual in nature and there
has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. These figures are based on the
interpreted continuity of mineralisation and projection into unexplored ground often around historical workings. The Exploration Target has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code
(2012). as detailed in the Company’s ASX announcement released on 25 September 2024 (available to view at www.asx.com.au). The Tonnage range for the exploration target is 1.5Mt to 2.1Mt,
the Grade range is 6.6g/t Au to 8.4g/t Au and the Ounces range from 320koz Au to 570 koz Au. The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information that material affects the
information included in the original market announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the original market announcement
continue to apply and have not materially changed. Dr Christopher Doyle (MAIG) and Dr Simon Dominy (FAusIMM CPGeo; FAIG RPGeo), are the qualified persons, as defined under National
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, responsible for, and having reviewed and approved, the technical information relating to the exploration target. Dr Doyle is
Novo’s Exploration Manager - Victoria and Dr Dominy is a Technical Advisor to Novo.
