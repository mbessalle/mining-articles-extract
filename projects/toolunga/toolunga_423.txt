Farm-in - Tibooburra Gold Project
Manhattan Corporation Limited (ASX:MHC or the Company or Manhattan) is pleased to announce the
execution of a Term Sheet for a Farm-In and Joint-Venture Agreement (Farm In Agreement) with Beatons
Creek Gold Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Novo Resources Corporation (TSX:NVO or ASX:NVO
or Novo Resources) to explore the “Northern Tenements” of its Tibooburra Gold Project in the north west
of New South Wales.
Highlights
▪ The Tibooburra Gold Project is a 2,200 km2 strategic land holding in the emerging Koonenberry Gold
District covering 220km of underexplored mineralised gold strike extent holding multi million ounce
gold discovery potential.
▪ Key Terms of the Farm In Agreement - minimum $1.5m expenditure over 2 years to earn a 70% interest
in the precious and base metals on the advanced high grade gold Northern Tenements
▪ Novo Resources to spend a minimum of A$500,000 on exploration within an initial 12 month
period and Issue 500,000 Novo Resources Shares to Manhattan (Initial Farm-In Period).
▪ After the Initial Farm-In Period, Novo Resources may elect to continue by spending a minimum
of A$1,000,000 on exploration within the following 12 months and issue a further 1,000,000
Novo Resources shares to Manhattan (Second Farm-In Period).
▪ On Completion of the Second Farm-In Period, Novo Resources can elect to walk away with no
ownership interest or establish an unincorporated joint venture, with the parties interests in
the precious and base metals in the tenements as follows:
Company Ownership Interest
Novo Resources Corporation 70%
Manhattan Corporation Limited 30%
▪ Manhattan to be free-carried to completion of a positive Definitive Feasibility Study
▪ The Farm In Agreement, includes the six (6) northern licences comprising of ~631 km2 of the
Tibooburra Gold Project (Figure 1). Manhattan will remain the beneficial owner (100%) of the nine (9)
Southern Exploration Licences comprising of ~1,564 km2 (Figure 1). The Terms Sheet is subject to the
satisfaction of conditions precedent within 60 days.
Manhattan Corporation CEO, Kell Nielsen commented: “ This Farm In Agreement is a great outcome for
both Manhattan and Novo Resoures, and would allow Manhattan to focus its attention on its 100% owned
Southern Tibooburra Gold holdings and its 100% owned Chebogue Lithium Project where we expect to have
land access shortly following the re-election of the Nova Scotian Provincial Government. Novo Resources
would bring to the Tibooburra Gold a team of highly skilled and experienced technical geologists renowned
for their expertise in exploration and mining with a proven track record over many decades in gold”.

Immediate Focus
Novo Resources has indicated it plans to immediately advance the Clone and New Bendigo prospects
located within a 25km long geological setting (lithological and structural corridor) that continues from the
south of New Bendigo to north of Pioneer and includes further targets that are yet to be drill tested (Figure
2).
Drilling at Clone in 2023 by MHC delivered high-grade mineralisation over a > 250 metre strike extent from
a ten (10) hole RC Programme (CL0001-10). All drill holes intersected significant mineralisation, including:
▪ 31m at 1.29 g/t Au from 60m, including 3m at 6.52 g/t Au (CL0002)
▪ 6m at 4.22 g/t Au from 66m, including 2m at 11.65 g/t Au (CL0004)
▪ 7m at 7.23 g/t Au from 81m, including 3m at 16.1 g/t Au (CL0007)
▪ 9m at 6.03 g/t Au from 16m (CL0010)
Whilst Recent Drilling completed by MHC at New Bendigo in 2023 returned significant shallow high-grade
mineralisation, including:
▪ 2m at 4.48 g/t from 17m and 2m at 9.78 g/t Au from 22m (NB0130)
▪ 7m at 4.76 g/t Au from 82m, including 3m at 8.96 g/t Au (NB0131)
▪ 21m at 1.23 g/t Au from 27m, including 3m at 2.37 & 4m at 2.7 g/t Au (NB0133)
▪ 13m at 2.57 g/t Au from 41m, including 3m at 8.71 g/t Au from 47m (NB0135)
▪ 4m at 5.97 g/t Au from 75m and 2m at 2.88 from 88m (NB0136)
These results were planned as follow up to previous drilling that returned:
▪ 30m at 4.03 g/t Au from 11m, including 5m at 20.86 g/t Au (NB0033) from 11m
▪ 7m at 13.10 g/t Au from 97m, incl. 5m at 18.01 g/t Au from 97m (NB0113)
▪ 16m at 13.89 g/t Au from 1m, including 3m at 69.20g/t Au from 7m (NB0083)
▪ 8m at 40.5 g/t Au from 70m, including 3m at 105.34 g/t Au from 70m (NB0089)
▪ 13m at 6.16 g/t Au from 50m, Incl. 3m at 25.48m from 51m (NB0122)
▪ 63m at 1.33 g/t Au from 24m, including 9m at 7.22 g/t Au from 56m (NB0105).

About the Tibooburra Gold Project
The Tibooburra Gold Project comprises a nearly contiguous land package of 15 granted exploration licences (~2,200
square kilometres) that are located approximately 200km north of Broken Hill. It stretches 160km south from the
historic Tibooburra townsite and incorporates a large proportion of the Albert Goldfields (which produced in excess
of 50,000 to 100,000 ounces of Au from auriferous quartz vein networks and alluvial deposits during its short working
life), along the gold-anomalous (soil, rock and drilling geochemistry, gold workings) New Bendigo Fault, to where it
merges with the Koonenberry Fault, and then strikes further south on towards the recently discovered Kayrunnera
gold nugget field. The area is conveniently accessed via the Silver City Highway, which runs N-S through the project
area.
Similarities to the Victorian Goldfields
After a detailed study of the Tibooburra District, GSNSW geoscientists (Greenfield and Reid, 2006) concluded that
‘mineralisation styles and structural development in the Tibooburra Goldfields are remarkably similar to the Victorian
Goldfields in the Western Lachlan Orogen’. In their detailed assessment and comparison, they highlighted similarities
in the style of mineralisation, mineral associations, metal associations, hydrothermal alteration, structural setting,
timing of metamorphism and the age of mineralisation, association with I-type magmatism, and the character of the
sedimentary host rocks. Mineralisation in the Tibooburra Goldfields is lassified as orogenic gold and is typical of
turbidite-hosted/slate-belt gold provinces (Greenfield and Reid, 2006).
