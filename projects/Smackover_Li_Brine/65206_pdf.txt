PFE FURTHER EXPANDS ACRES IN THE
SMACKOVER LITHIUM BRINE PLAY
25,998 ACRES LEASED IN THE ARKANSAS SMACKOVER LITHIUM BRINE PLAY ~
FIRST RE-ENTRY TEST WELL IMMINENT
HIGHLIGHTS
• 25,998 net acres now leased, increase of 16.7% increase on last reporting.
• 3,728 new core acres leased since last reporting.
• Pantera largest acreage holder outside of the majors (Exxon, Albemarle, Tetra,
Standard Lithium, Equinor ASA).
• SLB (NYSE: SLB) sub-surface 3D static model expected imminently inclusive of both
Lithium and Bromine potential.1
• Well location in final decision phase – first test well imminent.
• Norway’s AU$125 billion state-owned energy company Equinor (NYSE: EQNR)
recently entered the Smackover with an investment of up to AU$160 million in
Standard Lithium’s Brine projects across the Smackover.2
• Exxon Mobil (US$450 billion market cap) continues to conduct drilling operations
on their leased acres. Their strategic plan includes the construction of a sizable
lithium brine processing facility, aimed at advancing their project into full-scale
production.3
Commenting on the new leased acres, Executive Chairman Barnaby Egerton-Warburton
said:
“Our exclusive abstract agreement has continued to deliver for the Company with over 25,998
acres now under lease in America’s new “Lithium Capital “as other groups in the play now surround
us to the east, north, northwest and west of our acreage position”
“The significant investments by leading companies such as Exxon Mobil, Equinor, and Standard
Lithium in the Smackover region highlight the immense potential in this area. This, alongside the
strategic advancements in the area and the future construction of a large-scale processing facility
by Exxon underscores the potential of the Smackover Formation.”

“Our partnership with global technology company, SLB (NYSE: SLB) and the imminent arrival of
the advanced subsurface modelling will accelerate Pantera’s progress as we prepare for the first
re-entry test well.”
“We look forward to updating the market with further updates in the coming weeks.”

brine projects. Map indicates approximate outlines of Pantera and other acreage positions in the play which are constantly changing and as such
may not be 100% accurate. Once leasing by the Company is complete it will publish a detailed acreage map.
Forward Focus
• Sub-surface study by SLB - this modelling will provide Pantera with an updated model
of the Lithium and Bromine Brine potential and optimal locations for future wells.
• Re-entry of an identified well, located within the Project’s leased position, to test brine
grade, permeability, and porosity from the Smackover Formation.
• DLE (Direct Lithium Extraction) test of re-entry well samples by multiple DLE technology
providers.
• Continued Smackover Project growth through the acquisition of additional acreage.

Pantera Minerals Limited (ASX: PFE) (“Pantera” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the
successful addition of an additional 3,728 acres. This expansion continues to bolster Pantera’s Lithium Brine
Project, elevating its total acreage to an impressive +25,998 net acres, an increase of approximately 16.7%.
Negotiations continue for additional acres.4
About The Pantera Lithium Brine Project
The Project now covers a land position of +25,998 net leased acres of lithium brine prospective ground in
the Smackover Formation Arkansas, a known high grade lithium brine formation.
Exploration Target
The Project has established a conceptual Exploration Target5 ranging from 436,000 to 2,966,000
tonnes of contained LCE within the project’s 50,000-acre Exclusive Abstract Area,6 which houses the
Project. The estimate is based on lithium concentrations ranging between 225 mg/L and 450 mg/L
with a median value of 338mg/L, showcasing the potential world-class scale of the Project.
The Exploration Target’s potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has been
insufficient exploration to estimate a JORC compliant Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further
exploration will result in the estimation of a such a resource.
Exclusive Abstract Agreement
The project benefits from a crucial partnership with a commercial abstract company, underpinned by
a 50,000-acre Exclusive Abstract Agreement. This agreement, formed with the sole commercial
provider of mineral ownership abstract information for the project area, holds immense strategic
significance. Understanding mineral ownership is paramount in securing lithium brine leases, offering
a substantial commercial edge to the Project.
This Exclusive Abstract Agreement facilitates access to comprehensive mineral ownership records,
ensuring precise identification of owners and facilitating accurate execution of leases with the rightful

mineral rights holders. In the United States, the separation of mineral rights from surface rights
underscores the importance of examining records dating back to the 1800s for precise ownership
confirmation.
The Exclusive Abstract Agreement confers a pivotal advantage, enabling the Project to efficiently
obtain accurate mineral ownership information for the project area, setting it apart from competitors.
While such information is theoretically accessible from public records, the process is undeniably time-
consuming and labour-intensive.
Encompassing an extensive area of 50,000 acres, the Exploration Target identified pertains specifically
to these 50,000 acres, reinforcing the project's focus and potential within this defined scope.
Strategically Positioned
The strategically positioned Project is situated in the Smackover Formation in South-West Arkansas, a
renowned high-grade lithium brine formation. This area is home to various lithium brine explorers and
producers, including industry leaders such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), Standard Lithium (NYSE: SLI),
Equinor (NYSE: EQNR) Tetra Technologies’ (NYSE: TTI) and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB).
Arkansas offers an ideal jurisdiction for the development of brine projects, situated strategically in the heart
of the United States. With exceptional logistics and transportation links, a skilled labor force, and a proactive
and supportive state government, it provides all the necessary ingredients for successful project
development.
