    "description": "1st April 2025 Strategic US Antimony Acquisition, Coyote Creek Highlights: e EVR has reached agreement with a private US Investor to acquire 49 unpatented claims over the Coyote Creek Antimony Project in Utah, USA. e The claims cover both old workings and waste from historical antimony mining up to the 1920’s. * A historical non JORC resource estimate of 12.7 million metric tons grading 0.79% Antimony was estimated by the Utah Geological and Mineral Survey in 1975. The historical estimate above is not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. A competent person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code, and it is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the historical estimates will be able to be reported as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. eo The USA currently has no operating antimony mine and imports all its antimony concentrates.’ EV Resources Limited (ASX:EVR) (‘EVR or “the Company’) has reached agreement with a resources private investor based in the USA, for the acquisition of 49 unpatented claims (“The Claims”) over the Coyote Creek Antimony Project. The USA imports all of its antimony concentrates at present’ and the Coyote Creek Project appears to have the potential to become a domestic supplier of antimony at a time of well documented supply shortages. This acquisition follows EVR’s recent announcement of the proposed acquisition of 70% of Los Lirios, an open pit antimony mine in Oaxaca state Mexico. The Coyote Creek Project fits with EVR’s preference to develop an Americas antimony division based upon open pit mining opportunities.

Location The Coyote Creek claims are located in Garfield County, Utah, 11km east of the town named Antimony. The Canyon in which it is located is referred to variously as Coyote Creek Canyon or Antimony Canyon. Access to the project is via paved roads and then unpaved forestry roads navigable with a low clearance vehicle. pry — “189 > x : 8] Of 5TH, gemSE wy © Ca P= Be : Xt . a) cree Fer | Rok Great E Brigham City Lima, 5 ie ia gOgcien Semen a £3 (a > 50 § Views pe FL —— Lavton ss 2 Rania Cress Wendover on 5 20 Sa i913 4 i wwendover Air BennionTg Ashley National Forest Semar| a andy | N “2 | ol Force Range on™ JR fo osslat te A © ~~ _Duchasne oo uNI1TEDR 8 T aT E ss Pdi po ; PE toy 7‘ os Price Lintah and LGandy A > East Carbon Ouray LR.
