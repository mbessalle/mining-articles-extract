ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
19 March 2025 
Terra Uranium to Acquire 100% of High-Grade Tin, Silver & Gold Projects 
in NSW and Conducts Placement 
Highlights 
• 
Terra Uranium Limited (ASX:T92) (T92 or the Company) has entered into a Binding Term Sheet to acquire 
100% of the issued capital of LCT Metals Pty Ltd, which holds two Exploration Licences in the New England 
Tin Province, New South Wales, Australia. 
• 
100% acquisition of tenements upon which sit the Ottery Tin Mine, Castle Rag Silver project and Mole 
River Silver and Tin project.  
• 
The Ottery Tin Mine was the largest hard rock tin producer in the New England region of NSW, producing 
around 2,700 t of SnO2  at 2% Sn#. Mineralisation occurs in a series of 5 lodes hosted by an intrusive porphyry 
unit, surrounded by wide zones which also contain significant gold and silver. 
• 
The Ottery mineralised zone is at least 500m long, 30m wide, and extends vertically for at least 120m 
and is highly mineralised with intervals of >5% sulphides widespread.  
• 
Rock-Chip Samples Identified over a 13km Strike Include 64% Tin & 1,670 g/t Silver from Surface  
• 
Mole River has a strike length of 13km with 6km of known mineralisation, covering a large area with 
both tin and silver base metal zones.  
• 
The Tin Zone includes the historic Silent Grove mine with production at 3% Sn. Historic surface 
samples include: 
• 
64% Sn# 
• 
12% Sn# 
• 
5.21% Sn#  
• 
3% SnO2 below 15m in shafts# 
• 
There are also 24 outcrops with samples >30 g/t Ag as well as Pb and Zn over 13km of strike. Historic 
samples include: 
• 
97 g/t Ag and 4.1% Pb# 
• 
147 g/t Ag and 37 g/t Ag#  
• 
The Castle Rag Silver project encompasses a strike of over 7km in length, with historic high- grade 
surface samples including: 
• 
1,670 g/t Ag# 
• 
445 g/t Ag, 1.12% Cu # 
• 
210 g/t Ag, 1.19% Cu, 1.19% Pb, 0.41% Zn# 
• 
120 g/t Ag, 5.25% Pb, 0.6% Zn, 0.418% Sn# 
• 
247 metres north of the Castle Rag boundary also includes a rock-chip sample of 15.2% Cu# with 0.59% 
Pb# and 3.98% Zn#. 
• 
T92 has also received firm commitments from a number of sophisticated investors to raise $500,000 before 
costs by way of a placement of new shares in the Company at an issue price of $0.04 per share. 
• 
The Company remains well-positioned to take advantage of an anticipated recovery in the uranium price, 
reflecting the global recognition of nuclear energy’s critical role in a low-carbon future, with the retention 
of all projects in the Athabasca Basin, Canada. 
• 
The Exploration Results reported on this page are from historical data as stored in the NSW MinView 
Database. They have not been reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; a Competent Person 
has not done sufficient work to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; 
it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior 
reported Exploration Results may be reduced when reported under the JORC Code 2012;  nothing has 
come to the attention of T92 that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability of the historical Exploration 
Results; but T92 has not independently validated the historical Exploration Results and therefore is not to 
be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results.

Ottery Tin Mine 
The Ottery Tin Mine was the largest hard rock tin producer in the New England region of NSW, 
producing around 2,700 t of SnO2 at an average grade of 2%. Mineralisation occurs in a series of 5 
lodes hosted by an intrusive porphyry unit, surrounded by wide hydrothermal alteration zones.  
The Ottery tenement abuts the Taronga Tin project being developed by First Tin (who are 29.9% owned 
by MLX see ASX release 1 Nov 2024). Taronga was explored and developed towards a pre-feasibility 
study in the ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s by BHP and Newmont. The current Taronga Tin project has a resource 
of 23.2Mt at 0.16% Sn (see https://firsttin.com/taronga/). The distance from Taronga mine to Ottery 
mine is only 10km as per figure 2 above.

Further Work Program 
Exploration over the area has been extensive by many parties over the last 150 years. It is T92’s 
view that the Exploration Results are reliable as they have been reported by various parties over this 
time. A detailed analysis of the extent of this exploration will be an immediate priority following the 
close of the acquisition of LCT Metals by Terra Uranium.  
Primary mineralisation styles will be tin and silver/gold systems. 
The initial exploration program to be undertaken by T92 following closing of the acquisition will entail 
compilation of historical and existing data and planning of follow-up exploration to be undertaken 
second quarter and funded from the current capital raise. This will include field mapping and 
sampling to validate identified mineral occurrences in the MinView database to be reported in 
accordance with the JORC Code 2012.

The Competent Person states that the data presented is an accurate representation of the available 
data and studies for the Project at this time. The Exploration Results are reliable as they have been 
reported consistently and on several occasions over more than 100 years (see extensive list of 
references in JORC Table 1, Section 2 “Exploration done by other parties”) and that mineralisation 
has been confirmed by various independent parties. The Exploration Results reported here are from 
historical data as stored in the NSW MinView Database. They have not been reported in accordance 
with the JORC Code 2012; a Competent Person has not done sufficient work to disclose the 
Exploration Results in accordance with the JORC Code 2012; it is possible that following further 
evaluation and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior reported Exploration Results may 
be reduced when reported under the JORC Code 2012;  nothing has come to the attention of T92 
that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability of the historical Exploration Results; but T92 has 
not independently validated the historical Exploration Results and therefore is not to be regarded as 
reporting, adopting or endorsing those results. 
Tin Market 
Trading Economics reported that Tin futures rose to $35,900 per tonne, the highest since touching 
the four-month high of $33,675 on February 21st as geopolitical mishaps lowered supply from key 
producers. The advance of insurgent militant groups in the DR Congo drove Alphamin Resources to 
evacuate its tin mine in the region, one of the largest mines in the world. This magnified the impact 
of lower supply elsewhere, as export permits from Indonesia are expected to be delayed following 
bureaucratic breaks in the Lunar New Year, extending similar trends from the previous year. 
Additionally, reports indicated that Myanmar’s Man Maw mine has not yet been reinstated amid 
political conflicts in the major tin producer. Lower output from Myanmar’s Wa State in recent years 
has pressured the availability of ore for Chinese smelters, which continued to report tight conditions 
of feedstock availability at the turn of the year. On the demand front, increasing investment in 
hardware for AI technologies continued to underpin buying 
Terra Uranium is well-positioned to benefit from these favourable market dynamics, with its Ottery 
Tin Mine located only 10km east of, and adjoining, the Taronga Tin Mine being developed by First 
Tin.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut 
channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools 
appropriate to the minerals under investigation, 
such as down hole gamma sondes, or 
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These 
examples should not be taken as limiting the 
broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure 
sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or 
systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation 
that are Material to the Public Report. 
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has 
been done this would be relatively simple.  
• 
Surface samples of Mineral Occurrences are 
referred to by ID number and are publicly available 
on NSW MinView. As these are historical samples, 
details of sampling techniques are not available and 
further work will be undertaken to confirm the results.  
 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-
hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core diameter, 
triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is 
oriented and if so, by what method, etc). 
• 
No drilling has been undertaken by Terra 
 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and 
chip sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery 
and ensure representative nature of the

XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in 
determining the analysis including instrument 
make and model, reading times, calibrations 
factors applied and their derivation, etc. 
• 
Nature of quality control procedures adopted 
(e.g. standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable 
levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and 
precision have been established. 
• 
Surface samples of Mineral Occurrences are referred 
to by ID number and are publicly available on NSW 
MinView. As these are historical samples, details of 
sampling techniques are not available and further 
work will be undertaken to confirm the results.  
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
• 
The verification of significant intersections by 
either independent or alternative company 
personnel. 
• 
The use of twinned holes. 
•

Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting and style of 
mineralisation. 
• 
The Ottery Tin Mine was the largest hard rock tin 
producer in the New England of NSW (approximately 
2700 tonnes of SnO2 at a 2-3% recovered grade). 
• Tin/arsenic 
± 
base 
metal, 
gold 
and 
silver 
mineralisation occurs in a series of narrow lodes ( 
No’s 1 – 5) surrounded by wide hydrothermal 
alteration zones within Permo-Triassic adamellite (or 
monzogranite) 
emplaced 
along 
the 
boundary 
between 
Permian 
metasediments 
and 
acid 
volcanics. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drill holes: 
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in metres) of 
the drill hole collar 
o dip and azimuth of the hole 
o down hole length and interception depth 
o hole length. 
 
• No drilling has been undertaken or reported by T92 
 
Data aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short 
lengths of high grade results and longer 
lengths of low grade results, the procedure 
used for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such 
aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
• Exploration results have been reported with no 
cutting of high grades.   
• Cut-off grade used for reporting of samples is 15 g/t 
Ag or 0.1%Pb or 0.4% Sn or 0.02% Zn or 0.3% Cu or 
0.1 g/t Au or 400 ppm Bi 
• 
No drilling has been undertaken by Terra 
• Metal equivalents are not used. 
 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important 
in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
 
 
 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole 
length, true width not known’). 
• 
Exploration is at early stage so the final extents and 
geometry of the mineralisation is not known. 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
No drilling has been undertaken by Terra

Commentary 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high 
grades and/or widths should be practiced to 
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
Exploration over the area has been extensive by 
many parties over the last 100 years. 
• 
Selected results from historic sampling have been 
quoted to highlight the mineralisation present. The 
Exploration Results reported here are from historical 
data as stored in the NSW MinView Database. They 
have not been reported in accordance with the JORC 
Code 2012; a Competent Person has not done 
sufficient work to disclose the Exploration Results in 
accordance with the JORC Code 2012; it is possible 
that following further evaluation and/or exploration 
work that the confidence in the prior reported 
Exploration Results may be reduced when reported 
under the JORC Code 2012;  nothing has come to 
the attention of T92 that causes it to question the 
accuracy or reliability of the historical Exploration 
Results; but T92 has not independently validated the 
historical Exploration Results and therefore is not to 
be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing 
those results. 
 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but 
not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test 
results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating 
substances. 
• 
Exploration over the area has been extensive by 
many parties over the last 100 years. Review of the 
extent of this exploration will an immediate priority 
following the close of the acquisition of LCT Metals 
by Terra Uranium. 
• 
It is noted that a Historical Reserve currently exists 
over part of the Ottery Mine but are yet to the 
validated or quoted to JORC standard. 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work 
(e.g. tests for lateral extensions or depth 
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of 
possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling 
areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive. 
• The initial exploration program to be undertaken by 
T92 following closing of the acquisition will entail 
compilation of historical and existing data and 
planning of follow-up exploration to be undertaken 
second quarter and funded from the current capital 
raise. This will include field mapping and sampling to 
validate identified mineral occurrences in the 
MinView database.
