About Newcam
Newcam is a private company with iron ore assets in the Mid West of Western Australia. Newcam mine, haul and
export iron ore from Mt Gould through the Geraldton Port and recently purchased the JWD Wiluna assets from CuFe
Limited (ASX:CUF). Newcam have bulk storage capacity on long term lease at Geraldton Port and access to ship loading
and site to port haulage.
Aurumin's Managing Director, Brad Valiukas, commented:
“The iron ore at Sandstone is a bonus, and this potential joint venture with Newcam can accelerate our activity, reduce
the need for funding and remove logistical hurdles for export, de-risking the project overall. Importantly for Aurumin
shareholders, by joint venturing the iron ore we maintain far more upside and potential profit compared to a royalty-
based transaction.
“Aurumin remain focussed on generating the critical mass required for future gold production at our Sandstone
Operations. The next step for both the iron ore and gold is drilling and we can now get going on a combined
programme.

ABOUT AURUMIN
Projects
Aurumin Limited is an ASX-listed mineral exploration Company focused on the Sandstone region in Western Australia.
The Sandstone Operations were cornerstone by the acquisition of the Central Sandstone Project by the Company in early 2022.
 The Central Sandstone Project comprises an 881,300 ounce gold mineral resource, significant project infrastructure and an
expanding tenement footprint where the Company aims to support a gold mining operation in the future.2, 3
 The Company's Johnson Range Project has a Mineral Resource of 64,700 ounces at a grade of 2.51g/t Au, located midway
between Southern Cross and Sandstone.1
 The Birrigrin Project area was added in late 2022 and is 70km north of the Central Sandstone Gold Project. The Project has 39
mapped shafts dating to the early 1900s with recorded production grades up to 196g/t Au.
 The Central Sandstone Project also has DSO iron ore potential, that the company is looking to advance in parallel with the
gold Resources. The company has identified a discontinuous 6km strike of banded iron outcrops, with potential widths of 5 to
40m and a peak grade of 67% Fe from rock chips. 7
In addition to the Sandstone Operations, the Company has a significant landholding at its Southern Cross Operations.
 Mt Dimer regionally has a substantial tenure footprint with gold and iron ore potential. The Company is currently working
towards completion of the sale of iron ore rights to MinRes for a combination of upfront and milestone cash payments and a
$1/t royalty. 4
 The Mt Dimer Mining Tenements have been divested to Beacon Minerals Limited (Beacon). Historically the Mt Dimer Mining
Tenements produced over 125,000 ounces of gold from open pit and underground production of approximately 600,000
tonnes @ 6.4g/t. Aurumin retains a 2% net smelter return royalty on gold production above 12,000 ounces and on all other
minerals, and Beacon have released an initial Reserve of 21,100 oz Au. 5, 8
 The Mt Palmer Project historically produced via open pit and underground methods, generating approximately 158,000
ounces of gold at an average grade of 15.9g/t. Aurumin has divested 51% of Mt Palmer to Kula Gold Limited, who can earn
up to 80% by spending a$1M over 3 years. Aurumin can dilute to a 1% royalty on all minerals. 6
The Company is actively exploring its tenements and pursuing further acquisitions that complement its existing focus and create
additional Shareholder value.
