• Allaru is a valuable addition to NewPeak’s portfolio of critical minerals projects including the NT
Treuer Range vanadium and uranium and Canadian George River uranium and Rare Earth Elements
projects.
• NewPeak has simultaneously been divesting and monetising its existing mineral assets including
Finland, Sweden and New Zealand mineral projects.
• The sale of the Company’s Sweden strategic mineral permits has been completed and NewPeak will
receive a total of CAD$200,000 in a Canadian publicly listed company’s shares and a milestone
payment of CAD$1,000,000.
NewPeak Metals Ltd (ASX:NPM) (NPM, NewPeak or the Company) is pleased to announce that it
has executed a binding term sheet (Binding Term Sheet) with AusVan Battery Metals Pty Ltd (AusVan) and
all the AusVan shareholders (Vendors) to purchase all of the shares in AusVan from the Vendors in
consideration for $5 million worth of NewPeak shares at an issue price of $0.0165 per NewPeak share
(Proposed Transaction). Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction, NewPeak will become the sole
owner of AusVan, which holds 6 granted Exploration Permits and 1 Exploration Permit application
covering the Allaru Vanadium Project in northwest Queensland, which has an Inferred JORC Resource of
1

710 million tonnes of vanadium mineral resource, at 0.46 V O (wt%) (Project, Tenements).

Further information in relation to the Proposed Transaction is provided below.
In conjunction with the Proposed Transaction, NewPeak will undertake a capital raising by way of a rights
issue (Rights Issue) to raise not less than $2 million and not more than $3 million at an issue price of
$0.0165 per NewPeak share. Further information in relation to the Rights Issue is provided below.
This acquisition marks a significant step of the Company’s rejuvenation and transitioning plans in entering
the strategic critical minerals space, as originally reported to the market (NPM ASX release 8 January
2024). It follows in the footsteps of acquiring the George River Uranium, Rare Earth Elements (REE) and
Scandium project, Quebec and Labrador, Canada (NPM ASX releases 15 July 2024 and 26 June 2024) and
the Treuer Range Uranium-Vanadium project in the Northern Territory, Australia (NPM ASX releases 12
August 2024 and 19 July 2024). Additionally, the Company has been successful in divesting its Finland,
Sweden and New Zealand mineral projects (NPM ASX releases 18 June 2024, 24 June 2024 and 16
February 2024 respectively).
The capital raising and assets sales provide both immediate cash, as well as the receipt of staged cash
payments and tradeable shares over the near to medium term, to support the Company’s exploration
and future development plans for the Company’s critical mineral properties.
ALLARU VANADIUM PROJECT, QUEENSLAND
The Allaru Vanadium Project is located in the North West Minerals Province of Queensland around Julia
Creek, amongst numerous significant vanadium deposits held by other companies, some of which are
well on the way towards development (Figure 1). AusVan holds 6 granted Exploration Permits for Minerals
(EPM) and 1 EPM application comprising a total of 468 sub-blocks covering 1,498 square kilometres (refer
included Tenement Table).

Geology and Geology Interpretation
The Project is situated on the Euroka Ridge, a regional scale feature that separates the Carpentaria and
Eromanga Basins. The Euroka Ridge is a major Proterozoic basement-high feature trending northeast
between tectonic blocks of the Mt Isa Inlier Eastern Fold belt to the Georgetown Inlier. Basement rock
comprises coarse metamorphic sediments and granites. Towards the centre of the Euroka Ridge, several
perpendicular smaller scale ridges of the Mt Fort Bowen and Mt Brown-St Elmo ridges are found.
The Carpentaria Basin is comprised of Early Cretaceous to Middle Jurassic age, fluvial to shallow marine
dominated sediments of the Rolling Downs Group. The Carpentaria Basin is the northern lateral
equivalent of the Eromanga Basin (and Surat Basin). The Cretaceous formations drape across the
basement ridges. The Cretaceous Toolebuc Formation which hosts the Project mineral resource is an
upper marker formation of the stratigraphic sequence. Figure 2 depicts cross-section A-A’ showing the
Toolebuc Formation mineralised horizons across the Allaru project. A thin cover of Karumba Basin
unconsolidated Quaternary sediments unconformably cover much of the region.
Figure 2 – Allaru Project Mineralisation Representative Cross Section.
The Allaru Vanadium Deposit is stratigraphically hosted in the Toolebuc Formation. Primary vanadium
enrichment is considered as the source of anomalous levels of vanadium in the Toolebuc Formation, with
vanadium hosted in the mixed layer clays, pyrite and organic kerogens. Secondary vanadium enrichment
is interpreted to occur as the Toolebuc Formation weathers. Two key mineralisation domains are present
in the Allaru Project: 1) shallow weathered vanadium mineralisation, with potential molybdenum and REE
co-products, and 2) deeper fresh vanadium mineralisation, with potential transport fuel co-product.
Across the Project area, four horizons of the Toolebuc Formation have been correlated: TLBA, TLBB, TLBD,
TLBE. The mineralised section is stratigraphically typically contained within the Toolebuc TLBB to TLBD
plys. Recent exploration focus of the Project has been Allaru North (Figure 2), where mineralisation occurs
between unconsolidated surficial sediment and the base of weathering. The surficial sediments are a
quaternary sands sequence which is flay-lying, with a stable depth across the Project area, typically 12 m
deep. The base of weathering across the Project is typically 30 m deep. Allaru Central mineralisation is
below the base of weathering with depth ranging from 37 m to 85 m. Toolebuc horizon TLBB hosts the
upper portion of mineralisation and comprises the kerogenous shales and minor coquina of the Willat
Crossing Shale. In the Allaru Central area, the thickness of the upper TLBB ply is typically 1.8 m thick. In
the Allaru North area, TLBB is typically 1.8 m thick. Ply TLBD hosts the lower portion of the mineralisation
and comprises the kerogenous Arrolla Shale. Across the Allaru Central area, the TLBD ply is typically 2.8 m
thick. In the Allaru North area, TLBD is of a similar thickness, but due to poor vanadium grades has been
3

excluded from the resource estimations.
The vanadium grade has been composited over correlation Toolebuc Formation working sections. Across
the Allaru Central area, the selected TLBB-TLBD mineralisation working section ranges in grade from 0.38
to 0.52 V O (wt%), averaging 0.45 V O (wt%). In the Allaru North area, the selected Toolebuc TLBB
2 5 2 5
horizon working section ranges in grade from 0.19 to 0.68 V O (wt%), averaging 0.45 V O (wt%).

shale oil, with minor handheld pXRF testing completed to assess vanadium and other metal enrichment.
Drill cores for the project were longitudinally cut, with ¼ sampled for analytical testing and remaining ¾
retained and stored for future testing and studies. In early 2018, Vecco accessed the preserved 2015
Oilcorp drill cores and re-sampled the Toolebuc Formation for vanadium. Trace element and vanadium
testing to date was completed using XRF and laser ablation ICP-MS on 107 samples across 20 drill holes.
Exploration which forms the basis of the Allaru Project North area was drilling in early 2021 by AusVan.
The drill program comprised 39 4C-size core holes drilled at regular 1 km spacings. Drilling was undertaken
by Hodge Drilling Pty Ltd using DE810 drill rig (UDR650 equivalent). Detailed geological logs, geophysical
logs and assay sampling was completed. Drill hole exploration data capture was completed to CoalLog
standards and downhole geophysical logging was completed by Weatherford to API standards.

Sampling and Subsampling Techniques
Samples which were used in the MRE for the Project have been taken from drill cores only. No drill cutting
samples or surface samples have been used in the MRE. Core required for laboratory analysis was
sampled at the core storage facility from core storage boxes, after longitudinal core cutting. Full sections
(continuous and contiguous) of the quarter core of each sample internal were taken. Drill core sample
material was placed in labelled polyurethane bags, with an additional internal sample tag, and secured
and sealed. Collections of core samples were then secured in larger bags by drill hole and transported to
the laboratories for analytical testing.
The Allaru Project drill hole sample database contains 530 vanadium sample assays from 60 exploration
holes.
Included in the MRE:
411 core samples from 39 exploration holes drilled by AusVan in 2021; by Nargom Laboratories
using multi element analysis method ICP-OES.
105 core samples from 20 exploration holes assayed by Vecco in 2018, by ALS Laboratories using
multi element analysis method ME-ICP41 with check assay by XRF-15b;
Not included in the MRE:
14 core samples from 1 exploration hole drilled by Aquitaine in 1968, located southwest from the
Allaru Central area, that do not form part of the mineral resource estimates; and
an additional 36 drill holes containing core samples of Toolobuc Formation with oil yield assays,
and 2 drill holes with Proterozoic basement assays. These samples do not relate to the Toolebuc
Formation vanadium mineralisation, and do not form part of the mineral resource estimates.
Sample Analysis Methods
The 2018 Vecco core samples were submitted to ALS (ALS) Brisbane laboratory for sample preparation
and testing. ALS has a network of laboratories that are accredited by the National Association of Testing
Authorities (NATA; NATA corporate accreditation No: 825, corporate site No: 818). Once the samples
were received by ALS, they were weighted and entered into a sample tracking system. Samples were then
dried and crushed to ensure that 70% of the sample is below 6 mm, then pulverised until 90% of the
sample is below 75 µm. 1:50 pulverised sample (Pulp) were then tested for grind size. Pulp samples were
split for each of the different analytical methods, with the pulp reject retained and stored.
The 2018 Vecco samples were analysed by ALS. ALS Brisbane completed Leco, inductively coupled plasma
– optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analytical methods (C-IR07, C-
IR17, S-IR08, ME-ICP41, ME-XRF15b). ALS Perth completed Pt, Pd, Au analyses by inductively coupled
plasma – mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (PGE-MS23). ALS Vancouver completed sulphide sulphur – HCl
leach by Leco (S-IR06a). ALS samples tested by XRF were analysed for Al O , As, BaO, Bi, CaO, CeO , Co,
2 3 2
Cr, Cu, Fe, HfO , K O, La O , MgO, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, P O , Pb, Rb, S, Sb, SiO , Sn, Sr, TiO , V, W, Y O , Zn, Zr.
2 2 2 3 2 5 2 2 2 3
ALS samples tested by ICP-OES were digested by aqua regia. The digest was then analysed for Al, As, B,
Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W,
Zn. ALS samples tested by ICP-MS with 30 g FA for Pt, Pd, Au. ALS samples tested by Leco were analysed
for total carbon, organic carbon, total sulphur and sulphide sulphur.
The 2021 AusVan core samples were submitted to Brisbane Met Laboratory (BML), for sample
preparation and testing. Once the samples were received by BML, the samples were weighted, dried and
re-weighed. Then samples were crushed, then pulverised. Pulp samples were 1/8 riffle split for analysis,
with the pulp reject retained and stored. The 2021 AusVan samples were analysed by BML for moisture
(AS1038.1-3) and density (AS1038.21.1) and transported to Nagrom Laboratories Perth for ICP-OES multi-
element analyses. Nagrom samples tested by ICP-OES were digested then analysed for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg,
Na, P, Si, V, Zn.
Stratigraphic Geological Modelling
The stratigraphic geological model for the Project was developed using Maptek Pty Ltd Vulcan 3D
6

software version 12.0.5. The software is a well-suited tool for generating models of stratified deposits.
Three-dimensional stratified grid models were produced. The formation and horizon sequences were
modelled together with the Cainozoic sediments and base of weathering. The stratigraphic geological
model was generated using the following steps:
Drill hole database creation
Drill hole database validation
Overburden sequence – mapfile generation
Overburden sequence – isopach grid modelling
Overburden sequence – floor grids, stacked relative topography
Stratigraphic sequence – interpolation mapfiles
Stratigraphic sequence – isopach grid modelling
Stratigraphic sequence – reference horizon structural grid model
Stratigraphic sequence – horizon roof and floor grids, isopach stacking
Stratigraphic sequence – truncation of stratigraphic sequence to weathering
The triangulation estimator was used for the structure elements of the stratigraphic geological model.
This utilised the Delaunay triangulation algorithm, a commonly used technique for modelling sedimentary
structures and structural surfaces, such as structure roof, floor and thickness for bedded deposits. The
results are a unique interpolated surface which honours raw data values. A maximum triangle side length
of 5,000 m, trend order 0 and 9 smoothing passes, were used to relax triangle facets in order to produce
a smooth grid and improved contours. A grid was created over the triangulated surface, with a grid side
length of 200 m x 200 m.
Assay Data and Compositing
The stratigraphic grade model for the Project was developed using Maptek Pty Ltd Vulcan 3D software
version 12.0.5. The grade models were produced as grid models, associated to horizons of the
stratigraphic geological model. The grade was modelled horizon by horizon, using Vulcan’s integrated
stratigraphic modelling and assay compositing tools. The following steps were used to generate the
stratigraphic grade model:
Drill hole sample database creation
Drill hole sample database validations
Horizon Grade – Compositing and mapfile generation (mass-weighted averages)
Horizon Grade – Grade parameter grid models (inverse distance)
Horizon Grade – Truncation of grade grid models to subcrops
Density and Moisture Content
Density was estimated from the results of Relative Density tests completed on drill core samples using
the method AS 1038.21.1. Density testing was completed on all diamond core holes across the 2021 Allaru
North project. The results of the density testing are summarised in Table 2. Previous explorers have
established and adopted default Toolebuc Formation shale density of 1.85 g/cm3 (db). Based on the
results of the density tests completed for the Allaru Project, a density default 0.1-0.2 g/cm3 higher may
be suitable. However, the MRE has adopted a Toolebuc Formation shale density of 1.85 g/cm3 (db), on
the basis of consistency and conservativeness.
In situ moisture was estimated from the results of free moisture and total moisture tests completed of
drill core samples using the method AS 1038.1. Moisture testing was completed on all diamond core holes
across the 2021 Allaru North project. The results of the moisture testing are summarised in Table 3.
Previous explorers have typically adopted in situ moisture defaults of 6% - 10% for the Toolebuc
Formation. Based on the results of the moisture tests completed for the Allaru Project, at default 10% in
situ moisture for the Toolebuc Formation has been considered appropriate for the TLBB-TLBD
mineralisation domains in MRE.

Geological Model Validation
Geological model and interpolated grades were validated using several visual and statistical techniques
to gain further confidence in the reported Mineral Resource estimates.
Box plots and histograms were used as validation tools to verify the composited grades and provide a
range comparison between samples and composited model values. Figure 4 shows grade variability
boxplot. This process identifies any bias towards under-estimation or overestimation from the
compositing process. Grade contour plots for each horizon mineralisation domain were used as a
validation tool to verify the composited grade values and grade estimation in the geological model. This
process identifies any anomalous under-estimation or overestimation in grade interpolation or any

Mining Metallurgical and RPEEE
Consideration of reporting, in accordance with Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction
(RPEEE) guidelines to the JORC (2012) Code. Initial open cut mining and extraction assumptions for the
Allaru Project were based on the opinion of the Project consultant mining engineer. Factors that support
the economic viability of the deposit include: 1) Vast, flat-lying deposit with stable grade characteristics;
2) Sufficient data showing the continuous nature of the deposit; 3) Shallow depth of cover with
dominantly free-dig overburden; 4) Attractive vanadium market prices and economic outlook. At the
relatively early-stage, maiden Inferred Resources, mining assumptions and assumptions are based on
practical experience on comparable open cut projects.
Brisbane Met Labs prepared preliminary vanadium metallurgical options for mineral resource material
from the Project. Initial metallurgical test work included:
Review of metallurgical studies reported for Toolebuc Formation mineralisation to develop a
nominal flowsheet
One composite sample, comprising mineralised intervals from drill holes ARZ012, ARZ13 and
ARZ055 with test work investigating the nominal mineral processing flowsheet.
Head characterisation testing, investigations included assay by size fraction, carbon and sulphur
speciation. Results of the size fractions established 67% vanadium reporting to the minus 38-
micron fraction, which supports the potential for beneficiation by size.
Mineral QXRD test work – Quantitative XRD testing focused on identification and distribution of
clay minerals hosting vanadium enrichment. Quantitative XRD established vanadium enrichment
are likely hosted by clay minerals, across the observed clay species of montmorillonite and to a
lesser extent illite, kaolinite and goethite.
Based on the BML investigations it was reported that, based on comparable metallurgical work on the
Toolebuc Formation, a low-cost process of flotation, atmospheric acid leaching and solvent extraction is
expected to achieve vanadium extraction between 75% and 95%.
Resource Classification
The Project formation displays high organic content, highly lateral continuity, and stratigraphic
characteristics similar to coal deposits and likelihood of bulk horizon extraction. Therefore, it was
considered that coal industry standards provide the most suitable guidance in the geological methodology
of exploration, classification, estimation and reporting of these resources.
The geological complexity of the deposit was considered by evaluating the structural and depositional
environment of the deposit. The selection of suitable hole spacing classification criteria were made based
on consideration of coal industry guidelines. The Project’s central area mineral resource area is
considered simple-moderate complexity (Central Domain), characterised by shallow dips, uniform strike,
9

and single structural features. The complexity of the Project’s north area is considered moderate-slightly
complex (Northern Domain), characterised by slightly steeper dips, variable strike, variable weathering
profile and a series of basement-related faults.
The nominal spacing between points of observation considered for each resource classification is
summarised in Table 4.

Spacing (m) Between Points of Observation
Classification Central Domain Northern Domain
Measured 500 250
Indicated 1000 500
Inferred 3000 1000
After considering the spacing between points of observation, confidence classifications and resource
limits were then refined based on additional information supporting seam continuity, data density and
structural complexity within geological domains, such as fold limbs and fault blocks.
Mineral Resource Estimates
The Mineral Resource Estimates have been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The
Qualified Person and Competent Person reconciled the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves to Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 2014 Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and
Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014) Standards) as incorporated with NI43-101, and there
are no material differences. JORC Table 1 is provided in Annexure A.
An in-situ Inferred Resource tonnage of 710 million metric tonnes (Mt) of vanadium mineral resource, at
0.46 V O (wt%) was estimated for the Project, as at 31 January 2022. Table 5 provides a summary of the

NEWPEAK’S FUTURE EXPLORATION PLANS
NewPeak intends to conduct exploration at the Project, with the objective of upgrading the Inferred JORC
mineral resources, discovering additional shallow, oxidised Toolebuc resources and metallurgy testing to
define optimum processing technologies. The exploration program would include:
1. Additional exploration drilling be undertaken to further define lateral stratigraphic continuation
and grade of the ore body throughout the resource areas.
2. Further scout exploration drilling to test for shallow, oxidised mineralised Toolebuc Formation
across the wider Project area.
3. Additional metallurgical test work, including additional composite samples, to increase
representation of ore type and variation. Further beneficiation test work will be carried out to
optimize roasting, grinding, cyclone and flotation options, investigate additional leach options to
reduce acid consumption, and testing of the proposed precipitation circuits to understand and
improve product purity.
WHY VANADIUM? A High-Potential Investment for the Green Energy Transition
Traditionally valued in the steel industry, vanadium is now emerging as a solution for the increasing
penetration of renewables into electricity grids across the globe. This is creating intermittency issues
around wind not blowing and sun not shining, creating a significant requirement for “grid scale” storage
solutions to effectively time-shift this electricity from when it’s produced to when it is required.

Vanadium is integral to vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are increasingly preferred for large-
scale energy storage systems (ESS). These batteries offer significant advantages over lithium-ion,
including:
• a lifespan of 20-30 years without performance degradation;
• scalability, making them ideal for storing intermittent renewable power; and
• safety, with no risk of thermal runaway.
A typical VRFB requires 5 to 10 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅) per MWh of storage capacity. With
7.4 GWh of planned or under-construction projects requiring approximately 65,000 tons of V₂O₅,
vanadium demand for batteries is on an exponential growth trajectory. If VRFBs reach even 10-15%
market penetration of grid storage by 2030, annual vanadium demand could exceed 300,000 tons.
Strong Steel Demand Drives Stability
Vanadium’s traditional role in steel production remains a critical driver of demand. 85-90% of global
vanadium output is consumed by the steel sector, where it enhances tensile strength, durability, and
corrosion resistance. These properties are essential for high-strength rebar, structural steel, and
automotive parts. The steel industry’s appetite for vanadium continues to grow, driven by:
1. Global Infrastructure Spending
China and India are leading the charge, with China investing $1.9 trillion in infrastructure as part of its
14th Five-Year Plan and tightening building codes to include higher vanadium content in rebar.
The global rebar market is projected to grow at 4.2% annually, and with 0.1-0.15% vanadium content
required per ton of rebar, even small increases in vanadium use translate into thousands of tons of
additional demand.
2. Automotive Industry Trends
Demand for high-strength, lightweight steel is rising in the automotive sector to improve fuel efficiency
and meet emissions targets.
The growing market for electric vehicles (EVs) will also require vanadium-enhanced steel for lighter,
stronger frames.
In 2023, the steel industry consumed 110,000 tons of vanadium, with demand expected to grow 5-6%
annually through 2030. As more countries adopt stricter building codes and sustainable construction
practices, the steel sector’s vanadium consumption could reach 140,000 to 160,000 tons annually by
2030.
Australia’s Vanadium Push: A Strategic Opportunity
Australia, particularly Queensland, is positioning itself as a global hub for vanadium production and
battery manufacturing. According to Queensland Resources Minister Scott Stewart, the North West
Minerals Province holds an estimated $500 billion in critical minerals, including vanadium. The situation
where Australia (particularly Queensland) holds the second largest resources of vanadium in the world
yet produces no vanadium is a clear driver for Government’s excitement in promoting this sector.
Key Initiatives Supporting Vanadium Investment
1. Common User Demonstration Facility:
$75 million committed to create an industrial hub to trial production and support the extraction of
critical minerals.
Vanadium is listed as a first priority in these efforts.
2. Battery Manufacturing Facility:
Australia’s first commercial vanadium flow battery electrolyte facility, with a nameplate production of
9 megalitres of electrolyte annually.
15

Initial investment of $15 million, with total funding expected to reach $50 million to secure Australia’s
position in domestic and global supply chains.
3. National Battery Testing Centre:
A core part of Queensland’s battery manufacturing strategy to ensure product quality and
competitiveness.
Supported through the Industry Partnership Program to foster local innovation.
In addition to the above, Critical Minerals Queensland (CMQ, an agency within the Queensland
Government) is providing more than $50 million in grants to help fund companies wanting to explore
and extract critical minerals with grants up to $2 million and investments up to $30 million (QCMBTF),
with Critical Minerals Group’s Lindfield Vanadium Project having been allocated up to $2 million in late
August 2024 and Velox Energy Materials receiving a commitment to cornerstone up to $5 million to
advance its North Queensland Vanadium Project, also in the Julia Creek Region.
Supply Constraints and Market Potential
With production concentrated in China, Russia, and South Africa, vanadium remains vulnerable to supply
disruptions and price volatility. The increasing investment in Australia’s vanadium production and
electrolyte processing aims to diversify global supply chains and stabilize the market.
Experts project that overall vanadium demand will grow by 8-10% annually, with battery storage and
infrastructure development driving most of this growth. If VRFBs and high-strength steel adoption
continue at their current pace, global demand could surpass 500,000 tons of vanadium annually by 2040.
A Perfect Fit for ESG Portfolios
Vanadium aligns with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment strategies by enabling
sustainable energy systems. VRFBs promote low-carbon grids by storing renewable energy efficiently,
reducing reliance on fossil fuels. As companies and governments increase their commitment to net-zero
targets, vanadium offers an attractive opportunity for sustainable growth.
CONCLUSION: Vanadium—The Metal of Tomorrow, Today
Vanadium’s dual role—Not unlike lithium 15 years ago when the bulk of lithium produced was used in
the steady growth production of Glass, Ceramics and Grease (c75%) prior to the catalyst of significant
growth in electric vehicle development meaning battery demand now accounts for some 85% of
production. We have vanadium today where 85-90% is used in steel production, with the catalyst around
the increasing need for “grid scale” storage to offset the increased penetration of intermittent renewable
generation. Vanadium is integral to vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are increasingly
preferred for large-scale energy storage systems (ESS).

• Specification of the grid system used.
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control. |  |  | - AusVan 2021 drillhole collar survey was completed by Diverse
Surveys Pty Ltd using Leica GS18 equipment. Collar locations
are stored in grid datum GDA94 projected onto MGA94 zone
54.
- OilCorp 2015 drillhole collar survey was completed by
Lodewyk Surveys Pty Ltd.
- Holes were drilled vertically; verticality logs were run to
confirm deviation.
- The topography model was created from local survey points
and the 38 m regional SRTM elevation dataset and corrected
to the RTK survey points. |  | 
Data spacing and
distribution |  |  | • Data spacing for reporting of Exploration
Results.
• Whether the data spacing and distribution is
sufficient to establish the degree of
geological and grade continuity appropriate
for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
estimation procedure(s) and classifications
applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been
applied. |  |  | - Within the current Project Allaru North resource area drill
hole spacing is typically 1000 m. Within the Allaru Central
resource area drillhole spacing is between 2000 m to 4000 m
- Drill hole spacing is considered appropriate for the
confidence classification.
- Drill hole spacing was developed based on coal stratigraphic
deposit guidelines and assessment of the consistency of the
key mineralisation domains variables. No specific variography
study was completed for the MRE.
- AusVan 2021 and Vecco 2018 sample compositing of grade
data was calculated by thickness weighted averages from
individual sample results across horizon-by-horizon, to
represent the mineralised domains. |  | 
Orientation of
data in relation
to geological
structure |  |  | • Whether the orientation of sampling
achieves unbiased sampling of possible
structures and the extent to which this is
known, considering the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling
orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is considered to have
introduced a sampling bias, this should be
assessed and reported if material. |  |  | - Drill holes have been equally spaced across the deposit. This
drilling pattern is considered appropriate due to the shallow
dipping nature of the formation. The locations of the drill
holes have been sited to achieve maximum understanding of
the exploration area.
- The drill hole pattern to date is not expected to introduce any
bias to the resource estimate.
- All drill holes are in the vertical (90 deg) orientation. |  | 
Sample security |  |  | • The measures taken to ensure sample
security. |  |  | - AusVan 2021 core samples are placed into core trays,
labelled, sealed and secured for transport by the Project
geologists. Appropriate consignment notes are used in the
process. Drill core samples are assigned unique sample
identification numbers during sampling. Sample numbers,
hole numbers, depth intervals and Project are written on the
sample bags, and a sample id tag is included within the bag. A |  |

Notes:
1. These figures reflect the position of the Company as stated in the full year accounts the full year ended 30 June 2024.
2. These financial figures reflect the position of AusVan as stated in AusVan’s draft balance sheet for the year ended 30 June 2024.
3. Total expenses. As detailed in the Company’s accounts published for the full year ended 30 June 2024, $10,169,880 of this amount
was recorded as a “fair value adjustment” (see note 10 on pages 35-36 of the Company’s full year accounts for the period ended 30
June 2024, published 26 September 2024). As detailed further in the note, during the year ended 30 June 2024, LKO was suspended
from official quotation on the ASX and therefore being no active market for the securities of LKO, the Company group was unable to
use the quoted market price as the level 1 fair value hierarchy. Management determined the value in use of the investment using
estimates of its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by LKO and the present value
of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from dividends to be received from the investment and from its ultimate disposal.
Additionally, on 18 June 2024, the Company settled on the sale of the shares of its 2 Finnish subsidiaries to Canadian listed company
Golcap Resources Corp (Golcap) and part of the consideration included shares in Golcap.
4. This figure represents an estimate of AusVan’s total annual expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2024. NewPeak has been informed
by AusVan that this figure comprises $24,000 spent on exploration and $251,000 spent on administration (which itself includes
depreciation valued at $11,000 and $100,000 accrued as unpaid former CEO salary and wages).
5. Excludes the 2,600,000 performance rights of the Company on issue as at 30 June 2024.
6. NewPeak’s market capitalisation was approximately $2,472,368 as at 30 June 2024, based on the $0.020 per NewPeak share closing
price of NewPeak shares as at 28 June 2024, being the last trading day prior to 30 June 2024. Currently, the Company has 305,405,065
shares on issue, which would constitute a market capitalisation of $5,039,184 at the issue price of $0.0165 per NewPeak share .
7. As at 20 December 2024, the projected total number of NewPeak shares would be 608,435,368, and the projected percentage change
would be 99.22%.
8. As at 20 December 2024, the projected fully diluted market capitalisation would be $10,039,184 at the issue price of $0.0165 per
NewPeak share, and the projected percentage change would be 99.22%.
9. NewPeak shares proposed to be issued under the Maximum Subscription rounded down to the nearest whole NewPeak share.
10. As at 20 December 2024, the projected total number of NewPeak shares would be 790,253,549, and the projected percentage change
would be 158.76%.
11. As at 20 December 2024, the projected fully diluted market capitalisation would be $13,039,184 at the issue price of $0.0165 per
NewPeak share , and the projected percentage change would be 158.76%.
