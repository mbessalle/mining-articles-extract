# Arizona Metals Corp Acquires Additional Private Land for Development Infrastructure

**/Not for distribution to US newswire services or for release, publication, distribution or dissemination directly, or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or into the United States/**

TORONTO, May 6th, 2024 Arizona Metals Corp. (TSX:AMC) (OTCQX:AZMCF) (the "Company" or "Arizona Metals") is pleased to announce that it has completed the acquisition of 100% of an Arizona State Land parcel totaling 40 acres (the "Property"), located 400 metres northeast of its Kay Mine property. The Property was acquired from the Arizona State Land Department by way of an auction process. As part of this process, Arizona Metals commissioned independent biological and archaeological studies which both demonstrated zero adverse impacts or remediation requirements. The Property includes the surface and water rights, among other rights and benefits. The Company has also staked unpatented lode and placer claims that secure mineral rights to this land.

**Transaction Details**

The Company will make total payments of US$366,100 to the State of Arizona as consideration for a 100% interest in the Property.

_Marc Pais , CEO of Arizona Metals comments, "The acquisition of the Property is another significant de-risking step in moving the Kay Mine Deposit closer to a production decision.  Including the 71 acres of patented land that host our Kay Mine Deposit, this acquisition will increase our total holdings of private and patented land to 264 acres. The Property is contiguous with and adjacent to the 153 acres of patented land (including water rights and wells) acquired up to November 2023. The additional land we are acquiring increases the private land suitable for future mine infrastructure by 26% and is in-line with our vision of a minimally disruptive operation while also allowing for an expanded operational footprint._

_We believe that our Kay Mine Project has the potential to become one of Arizona's newest and highest-grade copper-gold-zinc-silver mines, with the main deposit and potential for all infrastructure to be located on private land. This would allow for a relatively small footprint while also providing high-paying jobs to the local community of Black Canyon City. The Kay Mine Project already has the benefit of being only an hour north of Phoenix, with excellent access to infrastructure, including rail, roads, water, and power. The acquisition announced today will provide the potential for an expanded operation, increased flexibility in mine design, and accelerated permitting timelines."_

**About Arizona Metals Corp**

Arizona Metals Corp owns 100% of the Kay Mine Property in Yavapai County, which is located on a combination patented and BLM claims totaling 1,665 acres that are not subject to any royalties, and 193 acres of private land. An historic estimate by Exxon Minerals in 1982 reported a "proven and probable reserve of 6.4 million short tons at a grade of 2.2% copper, 2.8 g/t gold, 3.03% zinc, and 55 g/t silver." The historic estimate at the Kay Mine was reported by Exxon Minerals in 1982. (Fellows, M.L., 1982, Kay Mine massive sulphide deposit: Internal report prepared for Exxon Minerals Company)

*The Kay Mine historic estimate has not been verified as a current mineral resource. None of the key assumptions, parameters, and methods used to prepare the historic estimate were reported, and no resource categories were used.  Significant data compilation, re-drilling and data verification may be required by a Qualified Person before the historic estimate can be verified and upgraded to be a current mineral resource. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify it as a current mineral resource, and Arizona Metals is not treating the historic estimate as a current mineral resource.

The Kay Mine is a steeply dipping VMS deposit that has been defined from a depth of 60 m to at least 900 m. It is open for expansion on strike and at depth.

The Company also owns 100% of the Sugarloaf Peak Property, in La Paz County, which is located on 4,400 acres of BLM claims. Sugarloaf is a heap-leach, open-pit target and has a historic estimate of "100 million tons containing 1.5 million ounces gold" at a grade of 0.5 g/t (Dausinger, N.E., 1983, Phase 1 Drill Program and Evaluation of Gold-Silver Potential, Sugarloaf Peak Project, Quartzsite, Arizona: Report for Westworld Inc.)

The historic estimate at the Sugarloaf Peak Property was reported by Westworld Resources in 1983. The historic estimate has not been verified as a current mineral resource. None of the key assumptions, parameters, and methods used to prepare the historic estimate were reported, and no resource categories were used.  Significant data compilation, re-drilling and data verification may be required by a Qualified Person before the historic estimate can be verified and upgraded to a current mineral resource. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify it as a current mineral resource, and Arizona Metals is not treating the historic estimate as a current mineral resource.
