Completion of Acquisition of Central 
Yilgarn Project – Yerilgee and 
Evanston   
Highlights 
 
• 
Five camp scale prospects with promising lithostructural 
settings and proven gold mineralisation. 
• 
Walk up targets defined - shallow high-grade gold and 
silver intercepts with limited follow up work, open along 
strike and at depth. 
• 
Exploration planning commenced to initiate activity in 
Q1 2025.  
  
Catalina Resources Ltd (ASX: CTN) (“Catalina” or the “Company”) is 
pleased to announce that it has completed the acquisition of projects 
in Central Yilgarn Yerilgee and Evanston greenstone belts from wholly 
owned subsidiary of Dreadnought Resources Limited (DRE), 
Dreadnought Exploration Pty Ltd (“Dreadnought”).  
 
These projects are located within an underexplored region of the 
world-renowned Yilgarn Craton, approximately 190 km from Kalgoorlie 
and presents a rare exploration play over multiple greenstones belts 
with proven mineralisation potential for gold, iron ore, lithium, nickel 
and Cu-Zn-Ag massive sulphides.  
 
The project covers an area of over 650 km2, and over approximately 
65 km of strike, along the Yerilgee and Evanston greenstone belts. 
 
Gold Mineralisation  
The Yerilgee Greenstone Belt currently hosts three primary camp-
scale gold targets: T6, T8, and T11. These exciting targets have shown 
proven mineralisation with several high-grade intercepts not followed 
up. Abundant gold in soil anomalies remain to be drilled or require 
additional drilling.

• T6 Gold Camp. Defined by anomalous gold and pathfinder soil geochemistry over an area of 5,000m 
x 3,000m. Drilling has intersected high-grade gold, with notable results including: 
o 
17m @ 4.1 g/t Au and 28 g/t Ag from 53m, including 4m @ 14.9 g/t Au and 72.2 g/t Ag. 
o 
16m @ 1.9 g/t Au from 0m, including 4m @ 8.5 g/t Au. 
o 
9m @ 2.6 g/t Au from 23m, including 3m @ 7.1 g/t Au.  
Key prospects within T6 include Chicken Little, Snowflake, and Megatron.  
• T8 Gold Camp: Defined by gold and pathfinder soil anomalism over 1,700m x 600m in area. Initial 
drilling intersected: 
o 
17m @ 0.7 g/t Au from 22m, including 8m @ 1.2 g/t Au from 27m. 
o 
10m @ 0.8 g/t Au from 0m, including 1m @ 6 g/t Au from 11m. 
• T11 Gold Camp: This 20 km long gold in soil anomaly contains rock chip samples with up to 
233 g/t Au. Independent geophysical reports have highlighted several high priority 
aeromagnetic targets associated with a structural thickening of the greenstone sequence 
within T11. This area has seen minimal follow-up work and is grossly underexplored. 
 
The Evanston Greenstone Belt currently contains two main camp-scale gold targets: T1 and T2, with 
proven mineralisation and significant high-grade intercepts that have yet to be followed up. 
• 
T1 Gold Camp: Characterized by high-magnesium basalts, ultramafic rocks, and banded iron 
formations. Significant gold-in-soil anomalies and historical gold workings are situated along the main 
banded iron formation horizon. Key findings include: 
o 
Viper: 15m @ 1.5 g/t Au from 12m, including 3m @ 6.7 g/t Au. Limited follow-up has been 
conducted to date. 
• 
T2 Gold Camp: Dominated by a large regional north-plunging syncline, this camp includes significant 
gold-in-soil anomalies and historical gold workings along major structural trends. Notable intercepts 
include: 
o 
Leghorn: 48m @ 0.6 g/t Au from 27m, including 21m @ 1.3 g/t Au. 
o 
Erk: A 3km-long north-trending gold-in-soil anomaly with numerous nugget patches.

Geology
Anticlinal dome of high magnesium basalts and ultramafic rocks overlain 
by banded iron formation, with minor sediments which have been intruded by 
lamprophyres and felsic to intermediate intrusions. Post-intrusion shearing along 
some of the intrusive contacts which correspond with significant gold-in-soil 
anomalies.
Work Done
Fertile camp identified in 2016 by Arrow Minerals, who had conducted 1x1km 
Bulk Leach Extractable Gold (BLEG) sampling. Since then, area has received 4970 
Soils and 598 AC holes to define the targets. Only12 RC holes have been drilled

T6 Gold Camp – Chicken Little
Geology
BIF hosted mineralisation associated with an intrusive felsic 
porphyry. Gold mineralisation is associated with significant silver 
and base metals. Initial drilling guided by a significant nugget 
patch that was discovered during earthworks.
Work Done
First pass aircore and two rounds of RC drilling has intersected 
variable mineralisation that could be due to plunging shoots or 
structural controls in an orientation oblique to drilling. 
Figure F
T6 Gold Camp – Megatron
Geology
Megatron identified by intense ~600m x 400m gold in soil 
anomaly associated with major cross cutting structures and 
multiple phases of felsic and mafic intrusions. Gold mineralisation 
appears associated with a strong carbonate and sulphide altered 
felsic porphyry.
Work Done
5 aircore lines (400m first-pass spacing with 100m infill) 
Figure G
T6 Gold Camp – Snowflake
Geology
Snowflake was identified by a ~800m x 200m gold and bismuth in 
soil anomaly associated with secondary N-S trending structure, 
significant quartz blow and felsic intrusions. High grade gold 
mineralisation was hosted within a near surface 1-2m quartz vein 
hosted within an altered felsic porphyry.  The orientation of the 
quartz vein is unknown and may be oblique to section. 
Work Done
First pass aircore drilling intersected significant mineralisation. No 
follow up drilling undertaken. 
Figure H
T8 Gold Camp
Geology
•
The T8 prospect was defined by a 1.7km x 600m gold-in-soil anomaly associated 
with As-Sb-Bi-Mo-W pathfinders, adjacent to a regional scale NNE trending structure 
and intense localised magnetic anomaly. 
•
Drilling identified an anticlinal closure of a banded iron formation (BIF) which had 
been replaced by pyrite, arsenopyrite and quartz in three holes, and had been 
intruded by a felsic porphyry along a major regional lineament
Work Done
Soil sampling, 13-hole RC program, and aircore program that extended and 
refined the bedrock gold anomaly. Target has not since been followed up
Figure I : T8 Prospect showing significant gold intersection, drill 
collars, soil anomaly and regional magnetics
Yerilgee –T11 Corridor
Geology
T11 is a ~20km long lithostructural corridor with gold in soil 
anomalism. Situated over a major regional structure with offsets within 
the center of the greenstone belt. Project wide gravity survey identified 
a significant blind intrusion at depth as a potential fluid and metal driver. 
Reviews by Jon Hronsky and Greg Hall both identified T11 as their 
favourite area. 
Work Done
Very limited first pass work completed and only a handful of aircore 
holes.  Recent work by Dreadnought has confirmed that UFF soils are 
more effective over the variable cover throughout the camp scale area. 
For target definition, 11,494 soils and 69 AC holes have been 
conducted. Only 2 RC holes drilled. No drilling since 2018 has been 
undertaken, and new prospective areas have been identified from soil 
geochemistry

Komatiite Nickel
The Yerilgee Greesntone Belt shares geological similarities to the 
Forrestania and Lake Johnston Greenstone Belts. Limited historical 
exploration has oberved the presence of nickel sulphides within thick 
cumulate ultramafics as well as laterite nickel-cobalt mineralisation. 
In 2023, Dreadnought engaged Newexco to conduct a nickel review 
with promising results
EM Surveys have defined multiple anomalies with first-pass work 
conducted by major nickel explorers
•
Western Areas Flew VTEM in 2015 
•
Arrow Minerals flew SkyTEM in 2020
•
Dreadnought Resources undertook a comprehensive review and follow 
up MLEM surveys, defining multiple targets around a central thickened 
komatiite unit
N5 and N14 have stood out as prioirty walk up drill targets as a result 
of this review and follow up target definition work which included 
groudn EM and surface geochemistry.
Exploration is still limited in coverage and there remains significant 
potential to define additional targets through systematic explroation.

• Historical iron ore exploration was conducted by Meteoric 
Resources and Macarthur Minerals (formerly Internickel 
Australia), and undertook geological mapping, rock chip 
sampling, geophysics and RC drilling programs
• Several compelling walk-up Fe-BIF targets remain to be tested 
after the ground was relinquished in 2016 due to depressed 
iron ore prices 
• 20km trend of rock chipped BIF containing >58% Fe has not 
been explored since 2016.
