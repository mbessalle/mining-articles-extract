Management Comment - Managing Director, Dan Power, said:
“The Koonenberry Gold team is extremely excited to add these highly prospective assets to our gold
and copper exploration portfolio.
The Enmore Gold Project is located only 20km south of Larvotto Resources’ Au-Sb Mine (ASX:LRV) and
shares similar geology and prospectivity. The Enmore Gold Project has some exciting historical high-
grade gold assays in drilling, rock chips and underground workings with clear targets, a well
understood geological model and a near-term opportunity to rapidly advance with drilling.
The Lachlan Projects include strategic landholdings in the Lachlan Fold Belt with early-stage results
across multiple targets. In addition, the Junee Project, in Joint Venture with a subsidiary of Newmont
Corporation, has seen a significant amount of work already completed and is 20% free carried.
Encouraging early-stage drill results point to porphyry Cu/Au discovery potential.
With a concurrent capital raising, supported by Lion Selection Group, Lowell Resources Fund as well as
our existing and new shareholders, the Company will be in a very strong position to fund its planned
activities. We believe this portfolio of 100% owned and free carried projects are extremely value
accretive for shareholders and have outstanding potential to yield a significant discovery.

SUMMARY OF ENMORE GOLD PROJECT
The Enmore Gold Project (EL8479) covers an area of 134km2 and is located in New England Fold Belt
(NEFB) in NE NSW approximately 30km from the town of Armidale and only 20km south of the
Hillgrove Au-Sb Mine (1.7Moz Au). In addition to Hillgrove, the NEFB hosts several large deposits
including the Ravenswood Mine (8Moz Au), Mt Morgan Mine (7.7Moz Au, 0.36Mt Cu) and Cracow
(2.5Moz Au).(1) Despite its clear prospectivity and total endowment of +35Moz Au, the NEFB remains
underexplored and the NSW segment of the belt considerably more so than the QLD segment.
Note that references to nearby or proximate discoveries do not in any way guarantee that the Company
will have any or similar successes in delineating a Mineral Resource. Refer to disclaimer on page 17.
Gold mineralisation at Enmore is orogenic in style and structurally controlled along three major NE
trending structures. The hydrothermal system was long-lived with two vein types observed:
 An early relatively low grade ductile silicified and sulfidic lode style mineralisation constrained
within and generally parallel to mylonite zones formed on the major NE trending structures.
 A later and higher-grade mineralisation event associated with britle deformation in dilational
and rheologically controlled shoots often oblique to the mylonite zones. Gold occurrences
associated with later event generally have a higher proportion of free gold and significantly
higher gold grades than the lode style structures.

SUMMARY OF LACHLAN PROJECTS
The Lachlan Fold Belt is home to major deposits such as Newmont’s 51Moz Au, 9.9Mt Cu Cadia Mine,
Evolution Mining’s 13Moz Au Cowal Mine and 5.2Moz Au, 4.4Mt Cu North Parkes Mine. (2) With a
combined endowment of +88Moz Au + Cu the Belt is considered world class. The Lachlan Projects
comprise 10 EL’s that are considered highly prospective for Porphyry Cu/Au, Epithermal Au and
Orogenic Au systems. Combined, the Lachlan Projects cover an area of 1,766km2, giving the Company
a commanding land position to rival major and junior exploration companies alike.

SUMMARY OF KOONENBERRY PROJECT
The Koonenberry Belt is a frontier Terrane prospective for Orogenic gold, VMS Cu-Au-Pb-Zn-Ag and
Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE systems. Traceable for over 225km, the Koonenberry Fault has acted as a long-
lived deep crustal structure that has tapped metal source rocks and acted as a conduit for mineralised
fluids. The Koonenberry Fault has numerous associated splays, second order faults/thrusts and
associated folds and is believed to be critical for concentrating these fluids and depositing metals
within trap sites and dilatant zones.
The Koonenberry Belt has been largely under-explored due to its remoteness, with past exploration
efforts considered to have been largely ineffective. In recent years however, the belt has been heavily
pegged by various explorers who have recognised the enormous prospectivity of the belt to host
significant Tier 1 deposits. Modern exploration techniques are being applied for the first time at a belt
and prospect scale and are likely to increase the probability of discovery.
The majority of the 2,510km2 Koonenberry Gold Project is considered highly prospective for Orogenic
Gold. With abundant evidence of gold mineralisation in multiple bedrock sources, a pipeline of
emerging targets and a +200km2 gold nugget field, the source of which has not yet been identified,
the Company believes it has the potential to discover significant gold deposits.
Furthermore, along the western margin of the Project a sequence of sedimentary rocks and volcanics
can be traced to the south where other explorers have demonstrated recent success in applying
electrical geophysical techniques that have resulted in the discovery of high grade Cu-dominant VMS
systems (G11 Resources Ltd, ASX announcement dated 4 June 2024 “High Grade Copper Intercepts at
Wilandra Central.” e.g. 9m @ 2.66% Cu from 310m, inc. 6m @ 3.46% Cu from 311m)3. The newly
acquired EL to the west of the Koonenberry Project is considered highly prospective for magmatic Cu-
Ni deposits with geology and tectonic setting akin to the Albany Fraser belt which hosts the world class
Nova-Bollinger Cu-Ni deposit.

exploration success. Refer to disclaimer.

FORWARD PROGRAM
Enmore Gold Project
The Company sees a potential rapid assessment of the Enmore Gold Project with drilling planned in
the near future at Sunnyside to test high grade shoot potential. Additional work will involve the
relogging and resampling of historical drill-core, additional surface sampling and potentially electrical
geophysics to focus additional drilling.
Lachlan Projects
The Company is currently prioritizing multiple pre-defined targets and prospects contained across the
large tenement portfolio of managed Lachlan Projects to advance to drill ready status. The results of
this work will determine the next steps, which will likely include reconnaissance field work,
geochemical surveys, additional geophysical work and drilling. In addition, the Junee and Fairholme
Projects continue to be managed, explored and funded by Newmont Exploration through farm-in and
joint venture arrangements.
Koonenberry Project
At Atlantis, the Company is planning to conduct additional surface geophysical Electromagnetic (EM)
work to help target further drilling. The survey will cover a much larger area of prospective
stratigraphy than had previously been surveyed (4,000m strike vs 600m previously).
At Bellagio, a high impact drilling program has been designed to test the recently identified Central
Gold Zone which is 50m wide and runs approximately parallel to existing drilling. Drilling will be
conducted along N-S oriented traverses and will test for down-dip/down plunge continuity of the gold
mineralisation.
In addition, the Company awaits approvals for drill testing of several targets which have recently been
identified along the Royal Oak fault which is known to control the gold mineralisation at Bellagio.

subject to change due to various factors including regulatory approvals and inclement weather.

Competent Persons Statement
The information in this announcement that relates to Exploration Results is based on information
compiled under the supervision of Mr Paul Wittwer, who holds a BSc Geology (Hons.), is a Member of
the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) and the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy
(AusIMM) and is the Exploration Manager of Koonenberry Gold Limited. Mr Wittwer has sufficient
experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and
to the activity which he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition
of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.’ Mr
Wittwer consents to the inclusion in this report of the matter based on his information in the form and
context in which it appears. Where reference is made to previous announcements of exploration results
in this announcement concerning the Koonenberry Gold projects, the Company confirms that it is not
aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information and results included in
those announcements.
Forward looking statements
This announcement may include forward looking statements and opinion. Often, but not always,
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as “may”, “will”,
“expect” “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “outlook” and “guidance” or other
similar words and may include, without limitation, statements regarding plans, strategies and
objectives of management, anticipated production or construction commencement dates and
expected costs or production outputs. Forward looking statements are based on Koonenberry and its
Management’s good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, regulatory and other relevant
environments that will exist and affect Koonenberry’s business and operations in future. Koonenberry
does not give any assurance that the assumptions on which forward looking statements are based will
prove to be correct, or that Koonenberry’s business or operations will not be affected in any material
manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by Koonenberry or Management or
beyond Koonenberry’s control. Although Koonenberry attempts and has attempted to identify factors
that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in forward
looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance,
achievements or events not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond
the reasonable control of Koonenberry. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements in these materials speak only at the date
of issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law in providing this information
Koonenberry does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking
statements or to advise of any changes in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such
statement is based.
Cautionary statement on visual estimates of mineralisation
Any references in this announcement to visual results are from visual estimates by qualified geologists.
Laboratory assays are required for representative estimates of quantifiable elemental values. Visual
estimates of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or substitute for laboratory
analyses where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal economic interest. Visual estimates
also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or deleterious physical properties relevant
to valuations.
Proximate statements
This announcement may contain references to other parties either nearby or proximate to Koonenberry
Gold’s projects and/or references that may have topographical or geological similarities to
Koonenberry Gold’s projects, the Enmore Gold project and / or Lachlan projects. It is important to note
that such discoveries or geological similarities do not in any way guarantee that the Company will have
any success at all or similar successes in delineating a Mineral Resource on any of Koonenberry Gold’s
projects, the Enmore Gold project and / or Lachlan projects.
