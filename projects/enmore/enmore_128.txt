ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
25 February 2025
Koonenberry expands Enmore Gold Project, NSW
securing gold-antimony targets
HIGHLIGHTS
Following Koonenberry Gold’s (ASX:KNB) acquisition of the Enmore Gold Project1
in NE NSW, the Company has identified and applied for an exploration licence (EL) over ground
adjacent to the Project, thereby consolidating the district:
 The new EL, which is now granted, adds 168km2, bringing total ground position at the Enmore
Gold Projectto 302km2.
 The area is considered highly prospective for gold and antimony, with historic soil sampling
results up to 91 ppb Au and 663ppm Sb2. This is the highest antimony result at the Project.
 The expanded Project area secures favourable geology and structural trends which share
strong similarities to Larvotto Resources’ (ASX: LRV) 1.7Moz Hillgrove gold-antimony mine
located only 20km to the north.3
 KNB will follow up highly anomalous gold and antimony results with sampling and mapping.

Koonenberry Managing Director Dan Power said: “This Exploration Licence secures Koonenberry a
strategic ground position of 302km2 within the Enmore Gold District. Our expanded ground holding
presents a substantial opportunity in an underexplored region, with the last exploration in 2008
returning significant soil gold, antimony and arsenic anomalism, including the highest tenor antimony
soil results of 663ppm. These have never received follow-up investigation.
The EL covers highly prospective geology, which is transected by important regional structures
including the Chandler fault which is known to be an important control and fluid conduit at the
Hillgrove Au-Sb Mine, less than 20km to the north.”

Koonenberry Exploration Licence (EL9747) secures an under-explored western portion of the Enmore
Monzogranite as well as the available portion of the Blue Nobby Monzogranite directly to the north.
Both of these intrusions form part of the prospective Hillgrove Intrusive Suite. Importantly, the area
also encapsulates continuations and parallel repetitions of prospective regional structures, including
the Chandler Fault, which transects the EL and continues to run NE as a controlling structure of the
Hillgrove gold-antimony mine less than 20km NE. Western extensions of the Sheba Fault, Borah Fault
and Sunnyside Faults, known to control mineralisation at Enmore, are also captured.
Historic soil sampling was completed in the area covered by EL9747 from 2006-2008 in response to
targeting a structural corridor identified through ASTER imagery.4 Gold, antimony and arsenic
anomalies resulting from this work are shown in figures 2-4. There is a clear association between the
mapped faults and the soil anomalies.
Gold in historic soilsreturned a maximum of 91ppb, with this anomaly returning >20ppb Au across a
300m x 1km area on a very coarse 200m x 100m sampling grid. Refer to Table 5 for the range of results.
Three additional highly anomalous +25ppb areas were also identified (Figure 2).
Antimony in historic soils returned a maximum of 663ppmSb, with a further three highly anomalous
+100ppm Sb samples. Refer to Table 7 for the range of results. Clusters of elevated antimony (+4ppm
Sb) extend up to 700m (Figure 3). The highest antimony result of 663ppm Sb is situated on the
Chandler Fault, a major crustal structure which is an important control and fluid conduit for gold-
antimony mineralisation at the Hillgrove Au-Sb Mine less than 20km to the NE.
Arsenic in historic soils reached a maximum of 710ppm, with a further five highly anomalous
+100ppm samples. Refer to Table 6 for the range of results. Clusters of elevated (+20ppm As)
extend up to 2km (Figure 4).

ENMORE GOLD PROJECT
The Enmore Gold Project is located approximately 30km south-east of the town of Armidale in north-
eastern NSW. Koonenberry Gold holds a 100% interest in the project which covers an area of 302km2.
The project is located on the New England plateau, which rises 800 metres above the Macleay River.
Maximum local plateau relief is approximately 140 metres, the highest local point being Mt. Bora,
some 1,200 metres above sea level.
Gold mineralisation within the Armidale district is closely associated with major fault zones which
extend in a 60km north-south trend from Rockvale (25km north-east of Armidale), to Hillgrove (20km
east of Armidale) and then 20km SW to the Enmore Project area. The Hillgrove mining camp is the
most significant historic gold deposit having produced 720koz Au with significant antimony (50kt) and
tungsten (2kt) also produced. Mineralisation at Hillgrove is bound to the north and south by NE
trending faults, a structural setting which is mirrored at the Enmore Project.
Alluvial gold was first discovered in the Enmore – Borah area in 1876. Prospecting and small-scale
production (via pits, adits and shallow shafts) was undertaken until the early part of the twentieth
century, with the last reported activity in 1940. Recorded hard rock gold production during this period
was 1,836 oz, however no records of production are available for the alluvial operations or the
numerous smaller mines in the field. The majority of this production was from the Lone Hand, Queen
of Sheba, Borah and Sherwood mines.

ENMORE GOLD PROJECT – GEOLOGY & MINERALISATION
The project area lies within a north-east trending zone of Permo-Carboniferous (302Ma) granitoid
plutons (Monzogranite) occurring en-echelon hosted within Carboniferous greenschist facies
Girrakool metasediments. The area is transected by major, north-east trending faults, which dissect
and locally fault-bound the plutons.
Gold mineralisation at Enmore is orogenic mesothermal in character and is structurally controlled
largely within mylonite zones associated with NE trending faults (such as the Sheba, Borah and
Sunnyside faults). The gold occurs in intensely sheared and altered Monzogranite and sediments as
well as in discrete quartz veins or zones of quartz veins in both igneous and sedimentary hosts.
Sheared zones within the granites can extend 10’s of metres into the hangingwall and footwall
positions providing significant vertical permeability for the ascent of mineralising fluids. Flexures of
up to 20 degrees in the strike of regional faults are often associated with higher concentrations of gold
mineralisation, including at the Sunnyside Prospect.
Mineralisation occurs as silicified breccias, quartz stockworks, sulphidic fractures and narrow quartz
veins hosted within the granitoid and metasediments and appears to be long-lived and multi staged.
An early gold event is associated with strong shearing, pervasive silicification and sulphides emplaced
along the ENE-WSW trending fault zones and tends to be relatively lower grade. A second overprinting
gold event has introduced gold in quartz veins developed within en-echelon fracture zones which are
tangential or oblique to the main structures trending. Gold occurrences associated with the later
event generally have a higher proportion of free gold and significantly higher gold grades than the
lode style structures. These tangential fracture zones are known to occur at Borah and at Sunnyside
but can also be identified in soil geochemical patterns. This structural setting and paragenesis is
similar to the Hillgrove deposit where the main mineralisation is hosted within a conjugate vein array
between the Hillgrove and Chandler fault system rather than within the main shear array.5 For the
most part, drilling at Enmore has been conducted orthogonal to the main shear zones rather than
targeting high-grade shoots oblique to those structures. It is therefore likely that drilling has missed
the high grade shoots.
Discrete mineralised zones are generally defined by intense alteration including a mineral assemblage
of quartz (crystalline and chalcedonic), sericite, carbonate (siderite), potassium feldspar, free gold,
pyrite and minor arsenopyrite and local concentrations of pyrrhotite and traces of chalcopyrite,
sphalerite and tetrahedrite.
The gold is usually associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite, arsenic assays being generally highest with
high gold values, but it is unclear how much gold is in solid solution in arsenopyrite or arsenian pyrite.
Other sulphides were not common in drill-holes and core intervals that assayed >1 g/t exhibited very
low base metals and even low Sb, although antimony is quite anomalous in surface soil samples.
Previous reports mention some ore shoots contain stibnite, chalcopyrite and galena.
Other intrusive igneous rocks thought to be genetically related to the Enmore gold mineralisation
include lamprophyre dykes which occur proximal to ore-bearing structures at the Lone Hand Prospect
(analogous to Hillgrove mine). Also similar to Hillgrove, a diorite intrusion also occurs at Enmore on
the SE slopes of Mt Borah).
It is postulated that gold was not introduced during the Permo-Carboniferous period associated with
the emplacement of the Enmore/Hillgrove batholiths, rather a later Permian event which produced
the ENE-WSW faulting along the Monzogranite contacts during NW-SE compression. Transition from
a ductile to brittle regime would have occurred in the late Permian (268-256Ma) which saw up to
12km of uplift in the New England Fold Belt during large scale oroclinal bending and tilting of crustal
blocks.6

SUMMARY OF ENMORE GOLD PROJECT
The Enmore Gold Project (EL8479 & EL9747) covers an area of 302km2 and is located in New England
Fold Belt (NEFB) in NE NSW approximately 30km from the town of Armidale and only 20km south of
the Hillgrove Au-Sb Mine (1.7Moz Au). In addition to Hillgrove, the NEFB hosts several large deposits
including the Ravenswood Mine (8Moz Au), Mt Morgan Mine (7.7Moz Au, 0.36Mt Cu) and Cracow
(2.5Moz Au).(7) Despite its clear prospectivity and total endowment of +35Moz Au, the NEFB remains
underexplored and the NSW segment of the belt considerably more so than the QLD segment.
Note that references to nearby or proximate discoveries do not in any way guarantee that the Company
will have any or similar successes in delineating a Mineral Resource. Refer to disclaimer on page 17.
Gold mineralisation at Enmore is orogenic in style and structurally controlled along three major NE
trending structures. The hydrothermal system was long-lived with two vein types observed:
 An early relatively low grade ductile silicified and sulfidic lode style mineralisation constrained
within and generally parallel to mylonite zones formed on the major NE trending structures.
 A later and higher-grade mineralisation event associated with brittle deformation in dilational
and rheologically controlled shoots tangential or oblique to the mylonite zones. Gold
occurrences associated with later event generally have a higher proportion of free gold and
significantly higher gold grades than the lode style structures.

Competent Persons Statement
The information in this announcement that relates to Exploration Results is based on information compiled
under the supervision of Mr Paul Wittwer, who holds a BSc Geology (Hons.), is a Member of the Australian
Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) and the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM) and is the
Exploration Manager of Koonenberry Gold Limited. Mr Wittwer has sufficient experience that is relevant
to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is
undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for
Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.’ Mr Wittwer consents to the inclusion
in this report of the matter based on his information in the form and context in which it appears. Where
reference is made to previous announcements of exploration results in this announcement concerning the
Company’s projects, the Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that
materially affects the information and results included in those announcements. The information in this
announcement that relates to the previous exploration results have been cross referenced to the original
announcement or are from the announcements listed in the references table.
Forward looking statements
This announcement may include forward looking statements and opinion. Often, but not always, forward
looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as “may”, “will”, “expect”
“intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “outlook” and “guidance” or other similar words and
may include, without limitation, statements regarding plans, strategies and objectives of management,
anticipated production or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.
Forward looking statements are based on Koonenberry and its Management’s good faith assumptions
relating to the financial, market, regulatory and other relevant environments that will exist and affect
Koonenberry’s business and operations in future. Koonenberry does not give any assurance that the
assumptions on which forward looking statements are based will prove to be correct, or that Koonenberry’s
business or operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or
foreseeable by Koonenberry or Management or beyond Koonenberry’s control. Although Koonenberry
attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ
materially from those disclosed in forward looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause
actual results, performance, achievements or events not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and
many events are beyond the reasonable control of Koonenberry. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements in these materials speak
only at the date of issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law in providing this
information Koonenberry does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-
looking statements or to advise of any changes in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such
statement is based.
Cautionary statement on visual estimates of mineralisation
Any references in this announcement to visual results are from visual estimates by qualified geologists.
Laboratory assays are required for representative estimates of quantifiable elemental values. Visual
estimates of mineral abundance should never be considered a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses
where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal economic interest. Visual estimates also
potentially provide no information regarding impurities or deleterious physical properties relevant to
valuations.
Proximate statements
This announcement may contain references to Mineral Resources, mines and exploration projects of other
parties either nearby or proximate to Koonenberry Gold’s projects and/or references that may have
topographical or geological similarities to Koonenberry Gold’s projects, the Enmore Gold project and / or
Lachlan projects. It is important to note that such discoveries or geological similarities do not in any way
guarantee that the Company will have any success at all or similar successes in delineating a Mineral
Resource on any of Koonenberry Gold’s projects, the Enmore Gold project and / or Lachlan projects.
