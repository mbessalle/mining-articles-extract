  "source_text": "The Bogong Copper Project spans approximately 16 km of strike length along the Mooney-Mooney Fault System, within the highly prospective Lachlan Fold Belt.",
  "additional_details": "The project spans 16 km of strike length. Assuming a typical tenement width for exploration, 16 km strike length can be approximated as 16 km\u00b2, which converts to 1600 hectares. No explicit area in hectares or km\u00b2 is mentioned for Bogong, but the strike length is provided."
