• Surface bauxite mineralisation to date has been defined over 4.5km by 2km zone with gallium
mineralisation defined over 4km by 2.3km area within laterite typical of the Darling Range Bauxite Deposits.
• With close proximity to Perth, major ports and all necessary infrastructure (Millendon Junction Railway Line
located on the western portion of current tenure). The Project is attractively positioned to exploit the
increasing demand for DSO bauxite.

Western Yilgarn Director Mr Kastellorizos commented:
“We are extremely pleased with securing the New Norcia Project as it provides further scalability and excellent
potential to increase the bauxite tonnage and grade through further exploration and metallurgical test work. The
location of the current resource is within trucking distance of a multi-user railway at a time of record alumina and
bauxite prices. The extensive bauxite zones have the potential for additional resource growth along strike and depth,
concentrating to the west and south of the current tenure. Western Yilgarn will be planning the next phase of drilling
within the project’s untested zone with a view of expanding the current mineralised footprint.”
“In addition, gallium metal is derived mainly as a byproduct of the processing of bauxite ore for aluminium. Based
on the high-grade gallium delineated through drilling, gallium may also provide a substantial credit to the
economics of the Project. Gallium is listed in the Australia’s critical minerals list1 and essential for modern
technologies like semiconductors, LEDs, and solar panels. It is considered critical due to its importance in advanced
manufacturing and its vulnerability to supply chain disruptions.” (1Source: CSIRO website: Critical minerals: the quiet
achievers gallium and germanium - CSIRO)
Western Yilgarn Limited (ASX: WYX) (“Western Yilgarn” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the
company’s Exploration Licence Application E70/6705 (current total application area is 76.6 km2) over the Norcia
Bauxite-Gallium Project.
Based on the current exploration data review, extensive rock chip sampling and drilling was conducted within the
eastern portion of E70/6705 within the outcropping laterite profile.
All completed drillholes with assay results locations are illustrated in Figure 2 and 3. Significant drilled intersections
shown in Tables 1 & 2 with total rock chip assay results presented in Appendix 1.

New Norcia Bauxite Project
The New Norcia Bauxite-Gallium Project can be accessed from Perth via the Great Northern Highway or Bindoon–
Moora Road approximately 120km. The Project is well supported by the Highway with the Millendon Junction
Narngulu Railway line located to the west of the Project area.
The tenement is part of the Darling Scarp Bauxite Province of Western Australia which centres on Pinjarra, Waroona
and Worsley aluminium production 80km to 150km south of Perth. In the early 2000’s the project was sold from
Iron Mountain Mining Ltd to Alpha Bauxite Ltd.

Geology
The Bauxite intersected is typical of that seen in a number of Darling Range deposits, representing a profile of
weathering and alteration, of apparently in-situ material, separated by a thin clay or saprolite interval from the
underlying ancient granite and gneiss of the Yilgarn Craton. Resultant bauxite zones occur as flat lying tabular
bodies, often pod like in nature. The bauxite development within the province has a close relationship with the
escarpment that marks the Darling Fault.
The typical bauxite profile in the Darling Range varies depending on the basement over which it is developed. The
most widespread basement and host to most of the known resources is coarse-grained Achaean granite. The
typical bauxite profile on granite consists of:
• Loose overburden of soil and pisolitic gravels. This ranges in thickness from 0 to 4m and averages about
0.5m.
• Duricrust (known also as hard cap). It ranges from 0 to typically 1-2m in thickness but maybe as thick as
5m over the mafic basement at Mt Saddleback. This material is part of the ore sequence of the operating
mines. The textures in the duricrust include tubular and brecciated however in almost all examples there
is a degree of pisolitic development with gibbsite surrounding an iron rich core.
Friable fragmental zone. Within the known bauxite mining areas of the Darling Range a substantial proportion of
the ore occurs in a loose non-cemented friable fragmental zone. This is typically 2-3m thick however it may be up
to 10m thick on granitic basement and 20m thick
Western Yilgarn’s Exploration Licence covers parts of the Darling Range which the Geological Survey of Western
Australia have delineated as “a clearly defined area which economic bauxite mineralisation is concentrated”
(Hickman et al., 1992).
Global Gallium Market
Gallium is a critical metal used in the defence industry and computer chip, semi-conductors, transistors, including
light emitting diodes (LED), fiber optic cables, and solar cell and electronic circuitry.
During December 2024, China announced an immediate ban on exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to
the United States, a day after the Biden administration imposed expanded restrictions on the sale of advanced US
technology to China. China bans export of gallium, germanium and antimony to the US - MINING.COM).
Gallium isn’t found in nature in its pure form, but it’s obtained as a by-product of aluminum and zinc production. The
top 3 producers of raw gallium are China, Germany, and Kazachstan, but China produces more than 95% (Gallium
Price Today & Historical - 2025 Forecast - Where to Buy)
It is anticipated that the US and European semiconductor chip makers will actively seek to establish long term
supply contracts with future Gallium suppliers (outside of China, such as Australia.
Forward Plan and Next Steps
The Project has exceptional growth potential based on the extensive data review. Surface and drilling geochemistry,
along with the interpreted geophysics has highlighted multiple targets proximal to the west and south of the current
tenure areas. Regional mapping and interpretation of the Western Australia Geological Survey has delineated
laterite and pisolitic gravels in which the bauxite occurs (refer to Figures 2 and 3). These areas will be systematically
targeted as first pass exploration.
Based on the historical high-grade gallium drill assays, all future exploration will focus on delineating the lateral and
depth extent of the gallium mineralisation with a view of producing a JORC Compliant Mineral Resource.

New Norcia bauxite areas were sampled using Vacuum

2010-2012, Iron Mountain Mining Ltd carried out an intensive exploration as

2012-2013, The project was sold from Iron Mountain to Alpha Bauxite which
carried out limited exploration. AC drilling, as part of technical due diligence,

situ material, separated by a thin clay or saprolite interval from the underlying
ancient granite and gneiss of the Yligarn Craton. Resultant bauxite zones occur
as flat lying tabular bodies, often pod like in nature.
The bauxite development within the province has a close relationship with the
escarpment that marks the Darling Fault.
The typical bauxite profile in the Darling Range varies depending on the
basement over which it is developed. The most widespread basement and
host to most of the known resources is coarse-grained Achaean granite. The
typical bauxite profile on granite consists of:
• Loose overburden of soil and pisolitic gravels. This ranges in thickness
from 0 to 4m and averages about 0.5m
• Duricrust (known also as hard cap) - It ranges from 0 to typically 1-2m in
thickness but maybe as thick as 5m over the mafic basement at Mt
Saddleback. This material is part of the ore sequence of the operating
mines. The textures in the duricrust include tubular and brecciated,
however in almost all examples there is a degree of pisolitic development
with gibbsite cutins surrounding an iron rich core.
• Friable fragmental zone. Within the known bauxite mining areas of the
Darling Range a substantial proportion of the ore occurs in a loose non-
cemented friable fragmental zone. This is typically 2-3m thick however it
may be up to 10m thick on granitic basement and 20m thick in the Mt
Saddleback area over mafic basement. This zone is generally an orange,
brown (apricot) colour and has a chaotic mix of gibbsite nodules and
pisoliths in a sandy matrix.
• Basal Clay (also described as mottled zone or saprolite). The basal clay
forms the footwall to the bauxite deposits. The contact between the
friable bauxite and basal clay is often seen as a sharp increase in clay and
