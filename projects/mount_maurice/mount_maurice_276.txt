commented Chris Donaldson, Executive Chairman. "Our recent exploration results, specifically the

The southern edge of the Mount Maurice tenements are approximately 20 kilometres north of the
company's Aberfoyle Sn-W-Li project (see March 15th, 2023 news release; Figure 1). The road
accessible claims are underlain by the 35 by 15 kilometre polyphase Scottsdale granitic batholith
considered to be prospective for tin and lithium mineralization. The area has seen very limited historic
exploration besides a regional stream sediment geochemical surveys, focused geological mapping,
and minor trenching. Trenching results from the Mount Maurice Sn-Cu showing, central to the
project, returned grades of up to 0.78% Sn and 1.4% Cu from quartz veins cutting greisenised
(coarse mica altered) granite (Ellis, 1984). These mineralized occurrences have yet to be drill tested
and lithium analyses have never been performed on any of the rock or stream sediment samples. A
phase 1 reconnaissance-style exploration program comprised of project-wide stream sediment
surveys, prospecting and rock-chip sampling is currently being planned.

applicable Canadian securities laws. When used in this news release, the words "anticipate",
"believe", "estimate", "expect", "target", "plan", "forecast", "may", "would", "could", "schedule" and
similar words or expressions, identify forward‐looking statements or information. These forward‐
looking statements or information relate to, among other things: the development of the Company's
projects; future mineral exploration, development and production; and the release of exploration
results.
Forward‐looking statements and forward‐looking information relating to any future mineral
production, liquidity, enhanced value and capital markets profile of TinOne, future growth potential
for TinOne and its business, and future exploration plans are based on management's reasonable
assumptions, estimates, expectations, analyses and opinions, which are based on management's
experience and perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, and other
factors that management believes are relevant and reasonable in the circumstances, but which may
prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the price of gold
and other metals; no escalation in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; costs of exploration and
development; the estimated costs of development of exploration projects; TinOne's ability to operate
in a safe and effective manner and its ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms.
These statements reflect TinOne's respective current views with respect to future events and are
necessarily based upon a number of other assumptions and estimates that, while considered
reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive,
political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Many factors, both known and unknown, could
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results,
performance or achievements that are or may be expressed or implied by such forward‐looking
statements or forward-looking information and TinOne has made assumptions and estimates based
on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: the Company's
dependence on early stage mineral projects; metal price volatility; risks associated with the conduct
of the Company's mining activities in Australia; regulatory, consent or permitting delays; risks relating
to reliance on the Company's management team and outside contractors; risks regarding mineral
resources and reserves; the Company's inability to obtain insurance to cover all risks, on a
commercially reasonable basis or at all; currency fluctuations; risks regarding the failure to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations; risks relating to project financing and equity issuances; risks and
unknowns inherent in all mining projects, including the inaccuracy of reserves and resources,
metallurgical recoveries and capital and operating costs of such projects; contests over title to
properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties; laws and regulations governing the
environment, health and safety; the ability of the communities in which the Company operates to
manage and cope with the implications of COVID-19; the economic and financial implications of
COVID-19 to the Company; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or
development activities; employee relations, labour unrest or unavailability; the Company's
interactions with surrounding communities and artisanal miners; the Company's ability to successfully
integrate acquired assets; the speculative nature of exploration and development, including the risks
of diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; stock market volatility; conflicts of interest among
certain directors and officers; lack of liquidity for shareholders of the Company; litigation risk; and the
factors identified under the caption "Risk Factors" in TinOne's management discussion and analysis.
Readers are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward‐looking statements or forward-
looking information. Although TinOne has attempted to identify important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be anticipated,
estimated or intended. TinOne does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these
forward‐looking statements or forward-looking information to reflect changes in assumptions or
changes in circumstances or any other events affecting such statements or information, other than
as required by applicable law.
