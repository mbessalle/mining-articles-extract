Cazaly Resources Limited (ASX: CAZ, Cazaly, or the Company) is pleased to announce it has
exercised the option to proceed with the earn-in Joint Venture with Brightstar Resources Ltd
(ASX: BTR) at the Goongarrie Gold Project (Goongarrie, or the Project).
Material Terms of Joint Venture Agreement
The terms of the earn-in joint venture agreement for the Goongarrie Project are:
• Cazaly to expend an initial $1m on exploration within 12 months to earn a 25% interest;
• Expend further funds of $1m within 18 months to earn a 51% interest;
• Expend further funds of $1m within 18 months to earn to an 80% interest.
Tenements included in the Goongarrie Project are listed in Table 1.
Cazaly’s Managing Director, Tara French comments:
“I am delighted to announce that Cazaly has exercised its option to earn up to 80% of the Goongarrie
gold project. We’ve been diligently working through the legal requirements to establish the foundations
of the joint venture and have advanced our knowledge and ongoing target generation at the project.
We are eager to provide updates on our progress as we work towards securing approvals for access
and are keen to get drilling as soon as possible. The recent success by Gorilla Gold at the nearby
Lakeview prospect is a clear indication of the untapped potential in this district and we look forward to
commencing our work.”

Exploration Activities
Data mining and
digitising continues for
historical data sourced
to date. Cazaly has
prioritised exploration
programmes to test the
prospects with the
highest gold gram-
metre drill results with
coincident structural
complexity and potential
for growth.
The Company is
planning various drilling
programmes to
immediately test known
targets and to explore
under-explored key
structural settings near
known gold
mineralisation.
Priority reverse
circulation (RC) drilling is
being planned (Figure 1 &
2) to validate and follow
up on historical gold drill
intercepts, to test along
strike, and up and down Figure 1. Location of the Goongarrie Gold project, 90km north of Kalgoorlie..
dip, of anomalous gold
mineralisation including 13m @ 3.5g/t Au from 36-49m in JRRC008 and 8m @ 10.7g/t Au from 75-
83m in JRRC024 at the Duke of York, and 38m@ 3.1g/t Au in KGA038 that extends from 62m to the
end of hole at the Hastings gold prospects.
The tenor and economic potential of unexploited gold mineralisation in the district is supported by
recent successful exploration activities, including anomalous drill results announced in February
2025, with 19m @ 18.1g/t Au and 11m @ 24.8g/t Aui and March 2025 with 96m @ 2.5g/t Au, including
20m @ 6.1g/t Auii at Gorilla Gold’s nearby Lakeview prospect at Comet Vale (Figure 1).
Reprocessing aeromagnetics for the entire project area has commenced in order to enhance and
better define key regional structures controlling gold mineralisation. Target generation on the
northern tenement area will be undertaken following merging and reprocessing of available
aeromagnetic data in order to better define structural controls on gold mineralisation beneath the
Goongarrie Lake sediments.

The Company will also undertake a more regional aircore (AC) drilling campaign to test
underexplored areas in the southern area along the Bardoc Tectonic Zone (Figure 2). These areas
include:
• 5 strike kilometers to the north of Jenny’s Reward open pit;
• 2 strike kilometers from Goongarrie Lady gold mine to Jenny’s Reward open pit; and
• 3 strike kilometers at the southern end of the tenement package

Prior to commencing exploration field activities several approvals are required, including:
• Heritage clearance. Negotiations are underway to establish Heritage Protection
Agreements with the Native Title Parties. Heritage site avoidance surveys may be required
across the proposed areas of drilling activity.
• Environmental clearance. A conservation management plan has been drafted and will be
submitted in order to obtain consent to enter a Department of Biodiversity Conservation
and Attractions (DBCA) managed reserve. This area only covers the Hastings prospect.
• Drilling approvals. Program of work applications will be lodged with the Department of
Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS)
A timeline of events will be provided as exploration plans are finalised and approvals are in place.

Goongarrie Gold Project
Goongarrie is located in the
northeastern goldfields, 90km north of
Kalgoorlie, and is easily accessible via
the Goldfields Highway that runs
along the western boundary of the
project area (Figure 3). The Project
consists of 70km2 of greenstone
sequence within the Kalgoorlie
Terrain.
Importantly the Project covers twelve
kilometers of the Bardoc Tectonic
Zone (BTZ), which is the northern
extension of the Boulder-Lefroy Shear
Zone (BLSZ) to the south, one of the
richest gold mineralised structures in
the Yilgarn Craton. Subsequent
exploration activities have identified
two additional subparallel N-S
structures that also have the potential
to host significant gold deposits.
Project History
Figure 3. Regional location - Goongarrie Gold Project.
Prior to 2019 when KWR acquired the
Goongarrie Project, very little exploration activity had been completed across the project as work
was focused at Menzies and Kalgoorlie. Historic work included soil sampling, trenching, auger
drilling, shallow aircore drilling, and limited RC drilling. This work targeted oxide gold mineralisation
at surface associated with the Bardoc Tectonic Zone-Boulder Lefroy Shear Zone (BTZ-BLSZ). Two
gold deposits along the BTZ were initially mined in the late 1980s at Jennys Reward, and Goongarrie
Lady which was recently re-commissioned by a private group. There is potential for the discovery
of new gold deposits undercover along the 12km strike length of the BTZ and along largely untested
parallel mineralised structures that run N-S through the length of the project.
In May 2023 KWR merged with Brightstar Resources Limited whose focus has now shifted away
from the Goongarrie project following their recent merger with Alto Metals Ltd (ASX: AME)iv.
