CAZALY EXERCISES OPTION TO EARN UP TO 80% INTEREST IN
GOONGARRIE GOLD PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
• Cazaly has exercised its option to proceed with the earn-in Joint Venture with Brightstar, securing
the right to earn up to an 80% interest in the Goongarrie Gold Project by sole funding exploration
expenditure of up to $3 million
• The staged earn-in structure remains as previously announced1:
o $1 million expenditure within 12 months to earn a 25% interest
o A further $1 million over 18 months to earn an additional 26% interest (total 51% interest)
o A further $1 million over 18 months to earn an additional 29% interest (total 80% interest)
• Exploration activities have commenced, with Cazaly reprocessing geophysical data across the
project area and prioritising drill planning at the Duke of York and Hastings gold prospects
• Brightstar retains exposure to exploration upside through the Joint Venture while focusing on its
core operational and development assets in the Laverton, Menzies, and Sandstone regions
Brightstar Resources Limited (Brightstar or the Company) is pleased to announce that Cazaly Resources
Limited (Cazaly) has exercised its option to proceed with the earn-in Joint Venture over the Goongarrie Gold
Project (Project), as originally outlined in the binding Term Sheet announced on 12 February 20251. This
follows the satisfaction of conditions precedent, including technical and legal due diligence by Cazaly.
Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, Cazaly may earn up to an 80% interest in the Project by
sole funding exploration expenditure totaling $3 million across three stages:
• An initial $1 million within 12 months to earn a 25% interest;
• An additional $1 million over a further 18 months to earn an additional 26% interest (aggregate 51%
interest); and
• An additional $1 million over a further 18 months to earn an additional 29% interest (aggregate 80%
interest).
Upon Cazaly earning an interest in the Project, Brightstar and Cazaly will form a Joint Venture to further
explore and potentially develop the Project. Located approximately 30km south of Menzies and accessible
via the sealed Goldfields Highway, the Project spans 70km² of prospective greenstone sequence within the
Kalgoorlie Terrain, including 12km of strike along the Bardoc Tectonic Zone (BTZ).

Brightstar’s Managing Director, Alex Rovira, commented: “We are pleased to see Cazaly exercise its option to
advance exploration at the Goongarrie Gold Project, as Brightstar streamlines its portfolio to focus on our core
development and operational assets at Laverton, Sandstone and Menzies. This Joint Venture enables Brightstar to
retain meaningful exposure to exploration success at Goongarrie while directing our resources toward ongoing
mining operations at Second Fortune, the development of the Fish underground mine and advancing the Laverton-
Menzies Definitive Feasibility Study. We look forward to working with Cazaly as it ramps up its exploration of the
Goongarrie Gold Project.”
Cazaly has advised that exploration activities are underway, with priority reverse circulation (RC) drilling
planned to test historical gold intercepts at the Duke of York and Hastings prospects, alongside broader
aircore (AC) drilling to explore underexplored areas along the BTZ. Additionally, reprocessing of
aeromagnetic data has commenced to enhance the understanding of gold-controlling regional structures.
Brightstar remains committed to its exploration strategy focused on growing and improving existing mineral
resources at projects with granted mining leases and near-term commercialisation potential, including the
Sandstone, Menzies, and Laverton hubs. The Goongarrie Joint Venture supports this focus by allowing
Brightstar to divest non-core exploration assets while retaining upside through its retained interest.

ABOUT BRIGHTSTAR RESOURCES
Brightstar Resources Limited is a Perth-
based gold development company listed
on the Australian Securities Exchange
(ASX: BTR or the Company).
The Company hosts a portfolio of high
quality assets hosted in the prolific
Goldfields and Murchison regions of
Western Australia, which are ideally
located proximal to significant regional
infrastructure and suppliers.
The Company currently operates the
underground Second Fortune Gold Mine
south of Laverton, and recently
completed the Selkirk Mining JV at
Menzies pouring first gold in March 2024.
In August 2024, Brightstar announced the
consolidation of the Sandstone district with the integration of the Sandstone and Montague East Gold Project
into Brightstar resulting in a total combined JORC Mineral Resource of 3.0Moz Au at 1.5g/t Au. The resource
is spread across three geographically separate hubs, providing excellent optionality for a staged
development of all assets to build to a meaningful ASX-listed gold producer.
