Joint Venture secured over advanced 
gold project in Western Australia’s 
world class gold mining district 
Highlights  
Cazaly signs binding term sheet with Brightstar Resources to earn up to 80% of the 
Goongarrie Gold Project located in the Kalgoorlie-Menzies district in the Eastern 
Goldfields of Western Australia 
The Project covers 12km strike of the Bardoc Tectonic Zone-Boulder Lefroy Shear Zone 
(BTZ), host to multiple world class gold deposits 
Several high priority gold drill targets with growth potential 
Gold mineralisation at the Hastings prospect extends for over 1km, and is open along 
strike and at depth. Anomalous intercepts include 38m @ 3.1g/t gold1 
Cazaly to spend up to $3M on exploration to earn staged equity up to 80% of the 
Goongarrie Project 
Cazaly Resources Limited (ASX: CAZ, Cazaly, or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has entered into 
an exclusive binding agreement with Brightstar Resources Ltd (ASX: BTR), to earn up to 80% equity in the 
Goongarrie Gold Project (Goongarrie, or the Project).  
Cazaly’s Managing Director, Tara French comments: 
“The Goongarrie gold project presents Cazaly with an outstanding opportunity to explore for new gold 
resources in a multi-million-ounce gold district. The sizeable land package has multiple gold targets 
and is largely untested at depth. We are very much looking forward to generating new gold targets 
and drill testing the existing prospects. With the gold price breaking A$4,600 oz for the first time, and 
with a positive pricing outlook, it’s the perfect time for Cazaly to get back into gold. We are pleased to 
have entered into the agreement for nil cash or scrip consideration with all funding going ‘into the 
ground’. We look forward to advancing this project and to working closely with our new partners at 
Brightstar to maximise value for shareholders.” 
 
 
 
1 01 February 2021. Kingwest Resources Limited ASX announcement “Stellar gold grades in Goongarrie Project discovery”

Goongarrie Gold Project 
Goongarrie 
is 
located 
in 
the 
northeastern goldfields, 90km north of 
Kalgoorlie, and is easily accessible via 
the Goldfields Highway that runs along 
the western boundary of the project 
area. The Project consists of 70km2 of 
greenstone 
sequence 
within 
the 
Kalgoorlie Terrain.  
Importantly the Project covers twelve 
kilometers of the Bardoc Tectonic Zone 
(BTZ), which is the northern extension of 
the Boulder-Lefroy Shear Zone (BLSZ) to 
the south, one of the richest gold 
mineralised structures in the Yilgarn 
Craton. 
Subsequent 
exploration 
activities have identified two additional 
subparallel N-S structures that also 
have the potential to host significant 
gold deposits. 
Material Terms of Joint Venture 
Agreement 
The terms of the earn-in joint venture 
agreement for the Goongarrie Project, 
subject to Cazaly completing due 
diligence, are: 
• 
Cazaly to expend an initial $1m on exploration to earn a 25% interest; 
• 
Expend further funds of $1m to earn a 51% interest; 
• 
Expend further funds of $1m to earn to an 80% interest. 
Tenements included in the Goongarrie Project are listed in Table 2. 
Project History 
The Goongarrie Project was acquired by Kingwest Resources Ltd (ASX: KWR) in 2019. In May 2023 
KWR merged with Brightstar Resources Limited whose focus has now shifted away from the 
Goongarrie project following their recent merger with Alto Metals Ltd (ASX: AME)i.  
Prior to KWR acquiring the Project, very little exploration activity had been completed across the 
project as work was focused at Menzies and Kalgoorlie. Historic work included soil sampling, 
trenching, auger drilling, shallow aircore drilling, and limited RC drilling. This work targeted oxide 
gold mineralisation at surface associated with the Bardoc Tectonic Zone-Boulder Lefroy Shear 
Figure 1. Regional location - Goongarrie Gold Project. 
 
 
3  
Zone (BTZ). Two gold deposits along the BTZ were initially mined in the late 1980s at Jennys Reward, 
and Goongarrie Lady which was recently re-commissioned by a private group. There is potential 
for the discovery of new gold deposits undercover along the 12km strike length of the BTZ and along 
largely untested parallel mineralised structures that run N-S through the length of the project. 
KWR completed aeromagnetic and passive seismic surveys in addition to AC, RC and diamond 
drilling, which largely focused on targets beneath thick clay sediments on Lake Goongarrie, along 
a N-S structure parallel to the BTZ. Several other gold prospects were also identified along the BTZ 
that require further drilling and will be the initial focus for Cazaly. Material assay results are listed 
in Table 1. 
Figure 2. Gold Prospects and historical drilling. NB: all gold prospects lie within the Project 
area, all mines and deposits on this plan are located outside the Project area.

Significant gold prospects (Figure 2): 
• 
Hastings – formerly the Area 9 prospect, bedrock gold mineralisation over 1km strike, 
including the anomalous gold intersection in KGA038, 38m@ 3.1g/t Au, that extends from 
62m to the end of hole at 100m depthii. The prospect lies under cover along the BTZ shear 
zone which hosts the recent +1Moz Aphrodite gold discovery located 9km to the south.  
• 
Duke of York – bedrock gold mineralisation along the BTZ shear extending from the open 
pit mines at Goongarrie Lady to Jennys Reward. Anomalous gold intercepts include 13m @ 
3.5g/t Au from 36-49m in JRRC008iii, and 8m @ 10.7g/t Au from 75-83m in JRRC024iv, and 
remains to be tested up dip and along strike. 
• 
Sir Laurence – widespread gold mineralisation over 2km strike within channel sands and 
gravels (eg KGA0409 3m @ 6.5g/t Au from 86-89mv) at the base of Goongarrie Lake 
sediments. Mineralisation was also discovered in the underlying bedrock within the Black 
Flag Group with anomalous intercepts including 5m @ 4.7g/t Au from 113.3m in KGD004vi. 
• 
Great Eastern – formerly the East Lake prospect, bedrock gold mineralisation within 
ultramafic and clastic sediments associated with a significant N-S trending fault and NW 
splays at the greenstone/granite margin.
