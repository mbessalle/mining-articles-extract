The newly acquired claims add 3.66 square miles to an existing 22.9 square mile package within one of the largest zones of hydrothermal alteration in the State<sup><b>1</b></sup>. These new claims contain significant historical drill intercepts and surface sampling results along a structure subparallel to the main Borealis trend.</p><p>Sixty-four claims were added by claim staking on the east side of current claim holdings, containing 14 historical drillholes and numerous surface samples containing significant gold mineralization. Highlights from these holes include: </p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>20m of 0.55g/t gold  in BRB003 and 12m of 0.62g/t gold  in BRB005, both from surface; </li><li>3m of 1.51g/t gold  beginning at 12m in BRB006; </li><li>12m of 0.42g/t gold beginning at 4.6m in BRB004;</li><li>10.7m of 0.48g/t gold beginning at 11m in BRB008.  </li></ul><p>Detailed historical geological logs have not been located for these drillholes but mapping in the field and the shallow depth of intercepts suggest that these intercepts are all oxides.</p><p>Historical surface samples within the new claims include 33 samples with gold grades between 0.3g/t and 1.57g/t and silver grades as high as 5 ounces per tonne.  The drillholes and surface samples are located along a northeast-trending structure over 1 mile in length, subparallel to the main Borealis trend.</p><p>The new Borealis claims are located in the same general area as the 583 claims recently staked by Headwater Gold (CSE: HWG) who are operating under an earn-in agreement with Newmont Corporation.  </p><p>Iain Campbell, VP Exploration of Borealis, comments \"The new claims contain meaningful Au mineralization in historical drillholes, and significant mineralization in multiple surface samples. This is an example of a previously discovered oxide target on the property, much like the existing Bullion and Boundary Ridge gold deposits, that just need more drilling to potentially bring into the future production pipeline. This gives the Exploration Team at Borealis the unique opportunity to take a methodical and patient approach to exploration for new deposits, expected to ultimately benefit investors and the company's bottom line.\"</p><p><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><sup><b>1 </b></sup>Steininger, Roger C., and Ranta, Donald E., 2005, Geology of the high-sulfidation Graben gold deposit, Borealis Mining District, Mineral County, Nevada, <i>in</i> Rhoden, H.n., Steinberger, R.C., and Vikre, P.G., eds., Geological Society of Nevada Symposium 2005: Window to the World, Reno Nevada, May 2005, p. 385-398</font></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#160;<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9344/228100_52246f8d949df9c7_001full.jpg\"><img src=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9344/228100_52246f8d949df9c7_001.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" alt=\"Cannot view this image?
