Tangadee Cu-Zn/Cu-Ni sulphide project.
The Tangadee Project currently consists of one granted exploration licence E52/4411 and one
exploration licence application E52/4439. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has the right
to acquire an additional granted exploration licence (E52/4413) expanding the Tangadee Project
area to a total of 249 blocks or 779 km2 located in the Ashburton region of Western Australia.
Figure 1. Location of the Tangadee Project in the Ashburton region of Western Australia
Teck Australia Pty Ltd, Dreadnought Exploration Limited, Bellavista Resources Limited, Miramar
Resources Limited, and Greatland Exploration Pty Ltd are all actively exploring for copper and
associated elements (Ag, Zn, Ni) within the district.
Bellavista have announced the discovery of outcropping copper mineralisation that assayed ‘up
to 9.4% Cu (5 samples over 2% Cu) in weathered sediments, mafics and laterite’ within 1.4km to
5km of the northern boundary of Avira’s tenement E52/44391.
Miramar have reported the identification of magmatic ‘nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) sulphides
(pentlandite and chalcopyrite respectively) within the Kulkatharra Dolerite in drill chips from holes
located 5km to the north of the northern boundary of E52/4411. This unit of Kulkatharra Dolerite
also strikes east in Avira tenement E52/44112.

Figure 2. Explorers are currently active within the vicinity of Avira’s Tangadee Project area
The Tangadee Project area (779 km2) straddles the faulted contact between the Edmund and
Collier Basins in the Capricorn Orogen of Western Australia. Avira is targeting sediment-hosted
Cu-Zn sulphide and magmatic Cu-Ni sulphide deposits, initially by drill testing three (3), already
defined, late-time EM conductors (VTEM) that lie:
 at the intersection of east-trending Mount Vernon Fault and NW-trending splays running
off the Mount Vernon Fault (Targets 1 & 2), or
 situated in a fold hinge zone located stratigraphically about copper anomalous
stratigraphy of the Edmund Group (Target 3).
These structural intersections and the fold hinge zone are the potential locus for the deposition
of high-grade Cu-Zn sulphide mineralisation.
No previous exploration drilling has been conducted anywhere within the Tangadee Project area
despite the plethora of high-quality exploration data that is available to Avira. Given the favorable
geology and geochemistry - historical lag sample that assayed 1080 ppm Cu , areas of albite-
sericite alteration that could be spatially and genetically related to sulphide mineralisation, and
already defined, late-time EM conductors - Avira is well positioned to advance the Tangadee
Project and potentially make a copper sulphide discovery in the coming 2025 field season.

Figure 3. E52/4411: Summary of historical exploration and location of VTEM Target 1on VTEM image
Historical exploration drilling conducted within a few kilometres of E52/4411, E52/4413 and
E52/4439 intersected broad intervals of highly-anomalous Zn-Cu sulphide mineralisation:
 BHP/Aberfoyle 18m at 1.0% Zn and 0.1% Cu;
 Bellavista 20m at 1.4% Zn and 0.14% Cu;
 Ausquest 20m at 0.12% Cu.
The drilling planned by Avira will investigate whether these three large, flat-lying EM conductors
reflect either oxidized sulphide mineralisation, conductive clay (e.g. alunite: a product of the
oxidation of sulphide) and/or zones of supergene metal enrichment in the regolith lying above
primary sulphide deposits.

Figure 4. E52/4413, E52/4439: Summary of historical exploration and location of VTEM Targets 2 and 3
Avira intends to target potential feeder conduits to these mineral systems.
Within E52/4411, a historical lag sample (WMC) collected on the Mount Vernon Fault assayed
1080ppm Cu, and a sample of duricrust collected by GSWA assayed 560ppm Pb and 190ppm
Cu. Neither have been followed-up previously.
Within E52/4413 and E52/4439, two late-time EM anomalies (Targets 2 and 3) have been
identified after the reprocessing of historical VTEM data collected for Ausquest Limited in 2018
(WAMEX A119773).
In addition to the targeting of sediment-hosted Cu-Zn sulphide deposits, late-time EM conductors
may also reflect the presence of magmatic Cu-Ni sulphide deposits located either within and/or
immediately adjacent to the Kulkatharra Dolerite.
Significantly, Miramar Resources Limited recently (ASX: Nickel & Copper Sulphides Confirmed at
Mount Vernon, 12 Dec 2024) identified copper and nickel sulphide mineralisation in olivine-
bearing dolerite/gabbro 5km to the north of E52/4411. This discovery substantially enhances the
prospectivity of the Kulkatharra Dolerite to host magmatic Cu-Ni sulphide deposits, and there are
multiple intrusions of Kulkatharra Dolerite within E52/4411.
Avira is of the view that its strategy to test late-time EM conductors located on and near major
structures (e.g. Mount Vernon Fault and associated splays), supported by anomalous copper
geochemistry, and commencing with the drill-testing of three untested, late-time EM conductors
has the potential to deliver early discover success.
