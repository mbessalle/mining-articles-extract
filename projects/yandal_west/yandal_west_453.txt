Agreement to Sell Yandal West Gold 
Project to Albion Resources (ASX: ALB) 
Sale allows GTE to focus on multiple upcoming high-impact 
programmes at Oval, Oval South, Sumo & Juggernaut 
Great Western Exploration Limited (GTE or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has entered into a binding 
agreement to sell the tenements comprising its non-core Yandal West Gold Project (the Project) to Albion Resources 
Limited (Albion) (ASX: ALB) (the Agreement) in an all scrip transaction that will see GTE retain exposure to future 
exploration success at the Project through a significant shareholding in Albion and milestone performance rights. 
The gross consideration payable by Albion to GTE comprises the issue of:  
• 
22,222,222 fully paid ordinary shares (Shares) (with a deemed issue price of $0.045 per Share representing 
consideration valued at A$1,000,000); and 
• 
30,000,000 performance rights with the performance milestones and expiry dates detailed in this 
announcement (Performance Rights). 
Completion of the Agreement, which is expected to occur in January 2025, is subject to the following conditions 
precedent:  
• 
Albion shareholder approval being obtained for the issue of the Shares and Performance Rights; and  
• 
GTE delivering any deeds of assignment and assumption reasonably required by Albion in order to transfer 
its interests in the tenements (see Annexure for list of Project tenements).    
Great Western Exploration Managing Director, Shane Pike, said: 
“Given the exciting exploration program Great Western has underway at its Oval Prospect and with multiple maiden 
drilling programmes at the Oval-South Copper-Gold target, followed by drilling at the Sumo Niobium Target and Six 
Juggernaut VHMS targets, notwithstanding the prospectivity of the Yandel West Project, it is not able to get the 
attention it deserves within GTE. 
We are therefore delighted to have reached an agreement with Albion Resources, which is well-funded and has the 
dedicated resources to progress the significant potential of the Project as GTE focuses on its upcoming high-impact 
drill programmes.  
GTE retains leverage to future exploration success at the Project through our significant shareholding in Albion post 
completion of the Project sale.”
