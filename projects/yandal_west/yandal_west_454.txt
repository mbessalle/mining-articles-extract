28 November 2024
Acquisition of High-Grade Yandal West Gold Project
• Albion has signed a binding tenement purchase agreement to acquire the Yandal
West Gold Project (“Project”) from Great Western Exploration Limited (ASX:
GTE)
• The Project is located in the world class Yandal Greenstone Belt, ~55km north
of the Bronzewing Gold Mine and ~60km south of the Jundee Gold Mine (both
owned by Northern Star, ASX: NST) in Western Australia’s Northeastern
Goldfields
• The Project is adjacent to the recent Siona gold discovery made by Yandal
Resources (ASX: YRL) which reported 107m @ 1.0g/t Au from 96m to end of hole
(estimated true width of ~30m) (see ASX YRL announcement 15 November 2024)
• Several shallow high-grade gold targets have been identified within the Project
for priority testing, including the Barwidgee Fault, Ives Find and May Queen
Targets
• The Company plans to aggressively explore the Barwidgee Fault Target, which
represents an exciting drill ready target (heritage clearance already completed)
with the potential to host a large gold mineralised system over its ~3km strike
(not including potential parallel shears). First-pass proof of concept drilling in
2023 returned significant gold results including 4m @ 9.0g/t from 39m and 7m @
1.02g/t from 23m (23YWRC023, GTE).
• The Ives Find Target represents possible analogies to YRL’s Siona discovery.
Significant intersections from Ives Find include:
o 4m @ 8.5g/t Au from 38m (IFRC004)
o 3m @ 52.3g/t Au from 34m (IFRC005)
o 6m @ 4.7g/t Au from 54m including 2m @ 13.0g/t Au (IFRC017)
• The May Queen target is west and parallel to the Barwidgee Fault and
underscores the potential for parallel structures of this prospective fault trend.
Significant results previously recorded at May Queen include:
o 4m @ 25.7g/t Au from 60m (HFRC022)
o 16m @ 1.64g/t Au from 13m (HFRC019)
• Average drill hole depth of only 55 meters offers exploration potential at depth
• Experienced mining executive Chris Tuckwell will join the Board as a Non-
Executive Director on completion of the acquisition, with Julian Jarman to step
down
• Albion Directors, who hold a combined total of 18% of the ordinary shares on
issue, have confirmed they will vote in favour of the Acquisition
• Contemporaneous with the acquisition, Albion is conducting a capital raising
(refer to today’s Trading Halt announcement)

Albion Resources Limited (“Albion” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a
binding tenement purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) to acquire the Yandal West Gold Project
(“Project”) from Great Western Exploration Limited (ASX: GTE), located in the highly prospective Yandal
Greenstone Belt in Western Australia’s Northeastern Goldfields. Completion of the Agreement is subject to
conditions precedent, including Albion shareholder approval being obtained.
Albion’s Non-Executive Chairman, Steven Formica, commented:
“I am delighted to announce the proposed acquisition of the Yandal West Project to Albion shareholders.
The Project is strategically located in a proven gold producing belt, positioned in-between the Bronzewing
and Jundee gold mines operating by Northern Star and surrounded by critical infrastructure. The Yandal
Belt continues to demonstrate its potential for major gold discoveries with the recent Siona gold discovery
made by Yandal Resources (ASX: YRL) which reported 107m @ 1.0g/t from 96m to end of hole (estimated
true width of ~30m).
The Acquisition will see Great Western Exploration (ASX: GTE) become a strategic substantial holder in the
Company. We look forward to progressing the significant exploration potential across the gold targets we
have inherited from GTE’s work as they now focus on their multiple high-impact drill programmes at their
Sumo Niobium Target and Six Juggernaut VHMS Targets, to follow drilling at their Oval and Oval South
Copper-Gold targets which is now underway.
With several shallow high-grade gold targets identified for priority testing, including the Barwidgee Fault
which is drill ready with heritage clearance already completed, we intend to begin an aggressive exploration
program on completion of the acquisition, which should provide a steady stream of exciting news flow for
shareholders in 2025.”
Yandal West Gold Project
The Yandal West Gold Project encompasses three contiguous tenements, E53/1612, E53/1816 and
E53/1369, covering a total area of 61km2. On completion of the acquisition and subject to conditions
precedent being met (including shareholder approval), Albion will acquire an 80% ownership in E53/1612
and E53/1816 (20% Diversified Asset Holdings Pty Ltd) and 100% ownership in E53/1369.
The Project lies within the Northeastern Goldfields Province of the Yilgarn Craton, in the northern section of
the Yandal Greenstone Belt (Figure 1). The Yandal Greenstone Belt is an elongate, fault-bounded, north-
northwest-trending belt of Archean mafic rocks and intercalated banded iron formations and felsic
volcaniclastic rocks. The belt contains the multi-million-ounce Jundee and Bronzewing gold deposits owned
and operated by Northern Star Resources (ASX: NST). The Mt McClure Fault and parallel structures that
are spatially related to numerous gold occurrences in the wider area, pass through the Project area including
the Project’s Bariwidgee Fault discovery where 4m @ 9.0g/t from 39m and 7m @ 1.02g/t from 23m was
intersected in 23YWRC023 (See ASX GTE announcement 8 November 2023).
The Project is adjacent to the recent Siona gold discovery made by Yandal Resources (ASX: YRL) which
reported:
o 107m @ 1.0g/t from 96m to end of hole (estimated true width of ~30m) (24IWBRC0039, YRL);
and
o 40m along strike of 24IWBRC0039 returned an intercept of 80m @ 1.0g/t from 67m (estimated
true width of ~28m) (241WBRC0047, YRL) (see ASX YRL announcement 25 November 2024).
The Siona discovery has been made on a 4.4 x 2km granitic intrusion within the greenstone. Similar
geological settings occur at the Ives Find and potentially the May Queen Prospect areas where significant
historical gold intersections have been returned related to similar granite intrusive within the greenstone.

Key Target Areas at Yandal West:
Barwidgee Fault Target
The Barwidgee Fault is a discrete largely untested structure evident in both magnetic and radiometric data
interpretation.
Four drill-holes completed by GTE in 2023 tested below and along strike from anomalous legacy Rotary Air
Blast (RAB) drilling (GTE ASX Announcement 15 September 2022) and high-grade rock-chip results
including 23.5g/t Au in the northern defined extremities of the Barwidgee Fault (GTE ASX Announcement 5
July 2017), Figure 3 and 4. This drill program resulted in significant assay results from drill-hole 23YWRC023
including 4m @ 9.0g/t Au from 39m and 7m @ 1.02g/t Au from 23m, and validated the prospectivity of
the Barwidgee Fault.
The significant results were recorded from a logged basalt-chert sheared contact, interpreted to dip to the
west. Based on this interpretation, the mineralisation recorded by 23YWRC023 was not intersected by hole
23YWRC022 (Figure 3), 23YWRC024 (located 50m south) and 23YWRC025 (positioned 600m to the north)
and legacy RAB holes angled to the west potentially paralleled 23YWRC023.

Figure 3: Cross section at Barwidigee Fault Prospect drilling.
Harris Find is a shallow drill defined gold mineralisation system hosted in the southern defined extremities
of the Barwidgee Fault (Figure 4). Significant intercepts in historical drilling at Harris Find include:
• 7m @ 4.3g/t Au from 27m (H11)
• 12m @ 2.1g/t Au from 35m (GYWRC009)
• 7m@ 1.13g/t Au from 44m (GYWRC017)
• 2m @ 6.55g/t Au from 26m (H5)
The Barwidgee Fault target represents an exciting drill ready target (heritage clearance already completed)
with the potential to host a large gold mineralised system over its ~3km strike, not including any potential
parallel shears. The Company plans to immediately follow up this drill target following acquisition completion
which will comprise RC drilling as well as further geochemistry and geophysics along the highly prospective
unexplored 2km strike to the south.

Ives Find
The Ives Find Target covers the historic Ives Find gold mining centre where total historic production of 2,019t
of ore for a total of 740 ounces of gold recovered (at an average grade of 11.4g/t Au) has been recorded.
Historical drilling at several prospects (Bell Miner, Duck, Duckling) across the Ives Find target intercepted
the following shallow, high-grade drilling results (Figure 5):

• CRC-12: 7m @ 7.4 g/t gold from 32m (incl 1m @ 23.0 g/t) - Bell Miner
• CRC-14: 3m @ 11.2 g/t gold from 42m (incl 2m @ 16.0 g/t) - Bell Miner
• IFRC003: 7m @ 2.52 g/t gold from 34m (incl 2m @ 4.8 g/t) - Bell Miner
• IFRC004: 4m @ 8.52 g/t gold from 38m (incl 2m at 15.6 g/t Au) - Bell Miner
• IFRC005: 3m @ 52.38 g/t gold from 34m - Bell Miner
• IFRC017: 6m @ 4.72 g/t gold from 54m (incl 2m @ 13.02 g/t) – Bell Miner
• IFRC087: 3m @ 15.02 g/t gold from 51m – Bell Miner
• IFRC058: 6m @ 5.10g/t gold from 36m (incl 1m at 21.0 g/t Au) - Duckling
• IFRC066: 4m @ 7.10g/t gold from 58m (incl 1m at 18.5 g/t Au) - Duck
• IFRC069: 4m @ 6.16g/t gold from 32m (incl 1m at 22.2 g/t Au) - Duck
The significant intersections at the Bell Miner and other prospects in the Ives Find Prospect area are all
hosted close to the western contact of a granite intrusive that extends for 4 km by 750m (Figure 2). The
geological setting at the Ives Find intrusive is very similar style as the recent Siona gold discovery by Yandal
Resources, which reported 107m @ 1.0g/t from 96m to end of hole (estimated true width of ~30m).

RC and diamond drill holes and significant drilling intersections

The majority of drilling to date has focused on the central western portion of the Ives Find granite intrusive.
The remaining areas of the intrusive remain underexplored (Figure 2). Interestingly, the Siona discovery
occurs along the contact which has not been tested at Ives Find. It is encouraging to see several significant
drilling intersections open at depth at Bell Miner within the granite (Figure 5) and these areas represent walk
up drill targets in the area as well as the untested eastern shear contact.
The Company plans to compile and review all the historical drilling, soil and rock geochemistry to identify
and define new target areas for further exploration work and drill testing.
May Queen
The May Queen Target area presents a geological setting of a greenstone belt that has been intruded by
several granite intrusions of various sizes similar to Ives Find target and the Siona gold discovery by Yandal
Resources. The mapped geology at May Queen Target is supported by magnetics data interpretation that
suggests a consistent package of NW-trending greenstone rocks that has intruded by granitic intrusives.
Previously completed drilling at several prospects (May Queen, MQW1, MQW3, MQE1) across the May
Queen Target has resulted in the following shallow, significant drilling results:
o HFRC022: 4m @ 25.7g/t Au from 60m – May Queen
o HFRC019: 16m @ 1.6g/t Au from 13m incl. 3m at 7.7 g/t Au & 17m at 0.8 g/t Au - MQW3
o HFRC005: 2m @ 3.6g/t Au from 69m and 4m at 1.6 g/t Au from 53m – May Queen
o HFRC070: 2m @ 6.6g/t Au from 44m incl. 1m at 12.6 g/t Au – MQE1

and 17m @ 0.8 g/t Au
Figure 6: GSWA 100K geology map of the May Queen area with several granite intrusives
showing the distribution of RC and diamond drill holes and significant drilling intersections

The majority of legacy drilling intersections are primarily structurally hosted mineralisation within basalt for
example at May Queen and MQE1 and most likely represent the southern extent of the highly prospective
Barwidgee Fault (Figure 6). However, further to the south at MQW3 significant mineralisation has been
intersected in what has been mapped as granite which is potentially a similar geological setting to the Siona
discovery. The larger widths of mineralisation within the granite in HFRC19 support bulk tonnage potential
similar to Siona. Given these encouraging developments, the Company plans to compile and review all the
historical drilling, soil and rock geochemistry to identify and define new target areas for further exploration
work and drill testing.
