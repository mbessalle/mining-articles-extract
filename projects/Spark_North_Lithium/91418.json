In the forward looking information contained in this news release, ExGen has made numerous assumptions, based upon practices and methodologies which are consistent with the mineral industry. In addition, ExGen has assumed: final TSXV approval of the Acquisition; the continued market acceptance of its joint venture partnership model; the ability of ExGen and its partners to raise future equity financing, if needed, at prices acceptable to ExGen or its partners; ExGen's current and initial understanding and analysis of the Spark North Lithium Project; the ability of ExGen or third parties to discover viable exploration targets and the results of exploration on the Spark North Lithium Project; and ExGen's general and administrative costs remaining sustainable.
