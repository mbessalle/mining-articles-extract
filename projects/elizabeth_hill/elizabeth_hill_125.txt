Errawarra Resources Ltd (ASX: ERW) (Errawarra or the Company) is delighted to announce that 
it has entered binding agreements (refer Acquisition Terms) pursuant to which the Company has 
acquired 70% of the historical Elizabeth Hill Silver Project (“Project” or “Elizabeth Hill”), 70% of the 
silver rights to the Pinderi Hills Project tenement package and 70% of the ownership of 3 tenements 
or tenement applications surrounding the silver project. This collective tenement package totalling 
180km2 is in the Tier 1 mining jurisdiction of the Pilbara, Western Australia (Figure 2 – Project 
Location). 
The Elizabeth Hill Project acquisition is conditional upon meeting the condition precedent and 
obtaining the relevant approvals, amongst others, Errawarra entering into separate joint venture 
agreements with Alien Metals Limited (Alien) (AIM: UFO) and GreenTech Metals Limited 
(GreenTech).  
This transformational acquisition ensures that the Company is now underpinned by a high-grade 
historical producing silver asset, with significant resource growth potential and future low-cost 
operational opportunities in a Tier 1 global mining jurisdiction. 
Chairman Thomas Reddicliffe commented:  
“This is an exceptional opportunity for our shareholders, and we are fortunate to have secured an 
interest in the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project and extensions. This will enhance our existing exploration 
projects in the same region of Western Australia with the addition of an interest in a high-grade past 
producing silver asset with growth potential not previously tested.” 
“The combination of existing high-grade silver intercepts signify growth potential and compelling 
exploration prospectivity at both near mine and regional targets. With Elizabeth Hill being located on 
an approved mining lease, this presents an opportunity for the Company to fast-track drilling and, if 
successful, mining supported by a buoyant silver market driven by strong investor demand and 
global issues.”  
“We look forward to immediately getting work underway with regular news in the near future”.

ELIZABETH HILL SILVER PROJECT OVERVIEW 
Proven Production in a Tier 1 jurisdiction 
Elizabeth Hill, one of Australia’s high-grade silver projects has a proven production history which 
included the recovery of numerous nuggets (Figure 1) as shown on the previous page: 
• 
High grades enabled low processing tonnes: 1.2Moz of silver was produced from just 
16,830t of ore at a head grade of 2,194g/t (70 oz/t Ag)4 
• 
Previous mining operation ceased in 2000: because of low silver prices (~US$5)5  
• 
Simplistic historical processing technique: native silver was recovered via low-cost 
gravity separation techniques  
• 
Untapped potential remains in and around the historic mine site, with limited exploration 
drilling and now outdated geophysics  
• 
Tier 1 Mining Jurisdiction located on a mining lease with potential processing option at the 
nearby Radio Hill site.

Outstanding Geology – High Grade Silver 
Elizabeth Hill hosts high grade silver mineralisation which has been confirmed by limited recent 
drilling completed by Alien Metals with impressive intercepts including6: 
•
11.7 m @ 5,371 g/t Ag from 13m (21EHDD003)
•
24 m @ 1,228 g/t Ag from 64m (AMEHRC009)
•
43 m @ 370 g/t Ag from 0m (22AMC001) including:
o
13 m @ 1,102 g/t Ag from 16m
•
24.8 m @ 915 g/t Ag from 2m (21EHDD001)
A summary of the key geological features of the Elizabeth Hill project are as follows:
•
The Munni Munni fault: considered prospective for repetitive silver deposits/pods
•
High grade historic lodes: six lodes are recognised within the Historic Elizabeth Hill Mine
mineralised envelope (Figures 3 and 4)
•
The Basal Lithologies of the Munni Munni Intrusion: the Munni Munni Intrusion is over 6
kilometres thick with the basal contact with underlying granite reporting anomalous silver in
soils over a 2 km strike length
•
Broader surface anomalies: numerous surface silver anomalies associated with NNE
trending faults sympathetic to the Munni Munni fault (Figure 5 - Regional map of Elizabeth Hill and
geological setting)
Significant Growth Potential 
Over several years, the surrounding land packages have been consolidated into a single contiguous 
180km2 package which provides significant exploration and growth potential both near the mine and 
regionally. This is important as it allows the undertaking of regional scale data gathering and 
interpretation across tenement boundaries without any impediments to exploration. 
Three distinct avenues have been defined to add significant value to the Elizabeth Hill Project: 
1.
Current Mine Resource Assessment including:
a.
Reprocessing & interpretation of data;
b.
Assessment of historical core & geophysics reprocessing; and
c.
Resource quantification to JORC 2012 standards.
2.
Near Mine Targeting including:
a.
Near mine targeting for repetitive silver lodes;
b.
Assessment of near surface open pit potential;
c.
Geophysics & Geochemistry; and
d.
Mineralisation remains open at Elizabeth Hill and will be tested for extension down dip
and along strike

Annexure B: JORC CODE, 2012 EDITION – TABLE 1 REPORT 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
 
Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (e.g., cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, 
such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. 
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g., 
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to 
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (e.g., submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed 
information. 
• Industry standard sampling techniques have been applied at the Project. 
• Reverse circulation (RC) drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples. 
• A cone or occasionally a riffle splitter was used to obtain representative 2.5kg – 
3.5kg sample into a uniquely pre-numbered calico bag and placed on the 
ground next to the remainder of the 1m sample. The samples were placed in 
order on the ground in ordered rows. 
• When water was produced by the hole, samples were continued to be taken 
with care to get as representative a sample per meter as possible. Water was 
expelled after rod change to reduce the amount of water in the ensuing samples. 
All efforts were made to ensure representative samples in wet conditions were 
taken. Notes were made on logging sheets for large volumes of water to ensure 
interpretation was consistent in the holes. 
• For some RC drilling intervals sampling was completed using 4m or similar composite 
sample intervals. When using 4m composites a uniquely numbered calico bag was used 
and the sample was collected by using a scoop through the sample pile to ensure the 
sample is representative. 
• Diamond core (DC) drilling was used in some drill holes. DC samples were via 
submission of half core which was sampled under geological supervision to 
geological contacts or up to 1m intervals. 
• The samples, with the QAQC samples, were transferred from the field or the 
secure core processing facility by Company staff to a secure yard for transport 
via freight contractors who delivered the samples and obtained chain of custody 
documentation to the nominated laboratory. 
• Certified Reference Materials (standards) and blanks were inserted approximately every 
25 samples. Additionally, RC field duplicates were also completed for nominated 
intervals, approximately 1 in 50 samples. 
• RC samples were oven dried, reduced by riffle splitting to 3kg as required and 
pulverized in a single stage process to 85% passing 75 µm. After assay via an 
appropriate method, approximately 200g of pulp material is returned to UFO for 
storage and potential re-assay at a later date.  
• DC samples were oven dried, crushed to a nominal 10mm by a jaw crusher, 
reduced by riffle splitting to 3kg as required and pulverized in a single stage 
process to 85% passing 75 µm. After assay via an appropriate method, 
approximately 200g of pulp material is returned to UFO for storage and potential

re-assay at a later date. 
• Samples were analysed by Bureau Veritas in Perth and all results have been received. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• Drill type (e.g., core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc.) and details (e.g., core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
• For RC drilling, an industry standard face sampling type RC hammer and drill bit was used, 
with chip samples returned within the drill pipe and recovered through a cyclone. Holes 
were drilled at various azimuths and dips to varying depths. Hole diameter is a nominal 
133mm in diameter. 
• DC drilling was completed by utilization of a top drive diamond core drilling rig which 
used an industry standard core barrel and wireline set up. Core was orientated, when 
possible, on 3m runs. Core was NQ in size (~47.6mm diameter). 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
samples. 
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
• The geologist visually assessed RC drill sample recoveries during the program for each 
meter and these were overall very good. Intervals of poor recovery are noted on 
the log sheet. 
• Drill cyclone was cleaned after each 6m run during the drilling of the hole and also between holes 
to minimise down hole or cross-hole contamination. 
• Some drill intervals were wet, and these intervals were collected into plastic bags.  
• For DC drilling, the core recovery is noted for each interval on the log sheet. 
• All drillers, at all times, are directed that quality and recovery of sample are of upmost 
importance. 
• No relationship between sample recovery and grade has been recognised. 
Logging 
• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level 
of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical 
studies. 
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) 
photography. 
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 
• All RC drill holes have been geologically logged for lithology, weathering, and other 
features of the samples using sieved rock chips from the drill samples. The level of 
geological detail is commensurate with nature and limitations of this exploratory drilling 
technique. 
• All DC is logged for core loss, marked into metre intervals, orientated, when 
possible, structurally logged, and logged with a hand lens with the following 
parameters recorded where observed: weathering, regolith, rock type, 
alteration, mineralization, shearing/foliation and any other features that are 
present 
• All DC is photographed both wet and dry after logging, before cutting 
• All drill holes were logged in full and logging is of a sufficient quality for the information to 
be used in future Mineral Resource Estimates, mining studies and metallurgical studies. 
• Data relating to the geological observations and the sampling intervals was entered in a 
standard industry database. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. 
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry. 
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation 
technique. 
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples. 
• All RC samples are put through a cone splitter and the sample is collected in a 
unique pre-numbered calico sample bag. The moisture content of each sample 
is recorded in the database. 
• The RC samples are sorted, oven dried, the entire sample is pulverized in a one 
stage process to 85% passing 75 µm. The bulk pulverized sample is then 
bagged and approximately 200g extracted by spatula to a numbered paper bag

• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, 
including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. Whether sample sizes 
are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. 
that is used for the assay charge. 
• The DC samples are sawn in half and the right half of the core is submitted for 
assay. They are oven dried, jaw crushed to nominal <10mm, 3.5kg is obtained 
by riffle splitting and the remainder of the coarse reject is bagged while the 3.5kg 
is pulverized in a one stage process to 85% passing 75 µm. The bulk pulverized 
sample is then bagged and approximately 200g extracted by spatula to a 
numbered paper bag that is for the assay charge 
• For some RC drilling, typically in areas where the geologist decides that there is no 
mineralization, 4m or similar composite samples are taken and used for assay. The RC 
drill spoil samples were collected by traversing each sample pile systematically by scoop 
to obtain similar volumes of representative material for the nominated composite 
interval. This is regarded as a fit for purpose sampling regime for the type of drilling and 
the current stage of exploration. 
• Field duplicate sampling was also undertaken with the drillers collected a duplicate at the 
same time as the main sample off the second sample port on the cone splitter or re-splitting 
of the reject interval if using a riffle splitter. 
• The samples were then sent to Bureau Veritas Laboratory for sample preparation and 
analysis. At the laboratory, the samples are sorted and discrepancies to documentation 
notified to the Company, oven dried, crushed to -10mm for core samples, riffle split if 
oversize and the bulk reject is retained. The sample is then pulverized in a vibrating disc 
pulveriser in a single step to 95% passing 105um, ~200g is split off and bagged for 
analysis and the bulk reject is retained. The sample sizes are appropriate for the geology 
and style of mineralisation being investigated. 
Quality of assay 
data and 
laboratory tests 
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and 
whether the technique is considered partial or total. 
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc., the parameters used 
in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations 
factors applied and their derivation, etc. 
• Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g., standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e., lack of bias) and precision 
have been established. 
• Assaying was completed by Bureau Veritas Laboratory in Perth, an accredited commercial 
laboratory. All sample results have been received. 
• For both RC and DC drilling, samples, appropriate commercial standards (Certified 
Reference Material), blanks and field duplicates were submitted at the rate of around 5% 
of all samples. 
• An aliquot of sample is fused with Sodium Peroxide and the melt is dissolved in dilute 
hydrochloric acid and the solution analysed via Inductively Coupled plasma (ICP) Mass 
Spectrometry (MS). The detection limit for Ag is 5g/t Ag 
• As part of normal procedures, the Company examines all standards and blanks 
to ensure that they are within tolerances. Additionally, sample size, grind size 
and field duplicate results are examined to ensure no bias to silver grade exists. 
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 
• The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company 
personnel. 
• The use of twinned holes. 
• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage 
(physical and electronic) protocols. 
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data. 
• Drill collar data, sample information, logging data and assay results have been verified, 
compiled, and validated by a separate person to the person conducting the logging and 
sampling. 
• All laboratory reports have been received. 
• All sample data is stored digitally in an offsite, secure, database (MX Deposit) and has been 
audited by independent external database specialists (Expedio Services, a Perth based 
geological consultancy).

Commentary 
 
• Many of these holes are within 20m of previous RC and DC drilling. Results of this drilling 
confirm the location, widths and grade tenor of the existing drilling. 
Location of data 
points 
• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), 
trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
• Specification of the grid system used. 
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
• Drill hole collar locations were located using a handheld GPS with an expected accuracy 
of +/-3m for easting and northing. Elevations were interpolated from the SRTM DEM grid 
of the area. 
• Down hole surveys using a north seeking gyro were undertaken on most of the drill holes. 
When no down hole survey is available, the collar dip and azimuth has been used. 
• The grid system used is GDA94, MGA zone 50.  
Data spacing 
and distribution 
• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
• Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and 
grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation 
procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
• Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
• This report is for the reporting of recent exploration drilling. The drill spacing, 
spatial distribution and quality of assay results is sufficient to support the JORC 
classification of material reported previously and is appropriate for the nature 
and style of mineralisation being reported. 
• The majority of RC holes were sampled at 1m, but when this isn’t the case, 
sample compositing to 4m has been applied in the field to collect a 
representative sample from the interval. 
• The nominal exploration drill spacing is 40m x 40m with many E-W cross-
sections in-filled to 20m across strike. This has been infilled with variable 
spacing for Resource estimate purposes to 20 x 20m and with underground 
grade control to 5.0 x 5m (N x E) spacing. 
• Reported assays in the attached Table are length weighted average grades. 
Orientation of 
data in relation to 
geological 
structure 
• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and 
the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. 
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised 
structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and 
reported if material. 
• The local stratigraphy and the contained mineralisation comprising the Elizabeth Hill silver 
deposit has a northerly trend and a near vertical dip.  
• The drilling was generally orientated towards the east or west with some holes angled due to rough terrain 
making placement of the drill rig impractical. 
• The true orientation of mineralised bodies in this area is generally known and no bias is 
indicated through the drill orientation.  
Sample security • The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
• All drill samples collected during the program are being freighted directly to the Bureau 
Veritas Laboratory in Perth for submission. 
• Sample security was not considered a significant risk to the project. Only employees of the 
Company were involved in the collection, secure core yard storage and delivery of 
samples to the freight companies secure yard. There was a chain of custody from 
receival at the freight company to the Perth laboratory. 
Audits or 
reviews 
• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
• No formal audits or reviews have been conducted on sampling technique and data to 
date.

Section 2 Reporting of Exploration Results 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Mineral 
tenement and 
land tenure 
status 
• Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or 
• material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, 
native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental 
settings. 
• The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to 
obtaining a licence to operate in the area. 
• The results reported in this announcement refer to drilling completed wholly on M47/342. 
• M47/342 is held by A.CN.643 478 371 Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alien Metals Ltd. 
• The tenement lies within the Ngarluma Native Title claim. 
• The tenement is in good standing with no known impediments. 
Exploration 
done by other 
parties 
• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. 
• The Elizabeth Hill deposit and adjoining areas has been explored for Ni, Cu, PGM, base 
metals, Li and Ag mineralization since 1968 when US Steel International Inc explored the 
area for base metals and nickel. 
• Massive silver was discovered in ~1994-1995 by Legend mining NL in a percussion hole 
drilling program. Further drilling followed and in 1997 an exploration shaft and drive was 
sunk by East Coast Minerals NL. 
• Underground mining at Elizabeth Hill was conducted in 1999-2000 with additional drilling 
completed by East Coast Minerals NL until the project was sold to Global Strategic Metals 
NL in 2012. Alien Metals Ltd purchased lease M47/342 in early 2020. 
Geology 
• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. 
• The Elizabeth Hill silver mineralization is structurally controlled and is located 
on the eastern boundary of the north-south trending Munni Munni Fault. 
Mineralisation has been intersected over a 100m north-south zone along the 
boundary of the Munni Munni Fault, plunging south along the granite contact. 
The zone has an east-west width of 15-20m with the high-grade core restricted 
to around 3m in the region of the underground. The mineralized zone is 
separated into several pods and occurs within a quartz carbonate chalcedonic 
silica breccia that shows hydrothermal characteristics with pervasive 
carbonatization and silica veining. The silver occurs in fine disseminations, 
needles, veins, nuggets and platelets up to several centimeters in diameter. 
Drill hole 
Information 
• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: 
• easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
• elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole 
collar 
• dip and azimuth of the hole 
• down hole length and interception depth hole 
length. 
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material 
and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent 
Person should clearly explain why this is the case. 
• No results from previous unreported exploration are the subject of this 
announcement. 
• Easting and Northing define the collar location in MGA94 zone 50 map 
projection. The map projection is a transverse Mercator projection, which 
conforms with the internationally accepted Universal Transverse Mercator 
Grid system. Collar elevations are RL’s (elevation above sea level) 
• Dip is the inclination of the hole from the horizontal (i.e. a vertically down drilled hole 
from the surface is -90°). Azimuth for current drilling is reported in magnetic degrees 
as the direction toward which the hole is drilled. MGA94 and magnetic degrees 
vary by approximately 1° in this project area 
• Down hole length of the hole is the distance from the surface to the end of the hole, 
as measured along the drill trace. Intercept depth is the distance down the hole as 
measured along the drill trace. Intersection width is the downhole distance of an

intersection as measured along the drill trace. 
• Hole length is the distance from the surface to the end of the hole, as measured 
along the drill trace. 
• Drill hole collar locations are recorded in the body of the release.  
Data aggregation 
methods 
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (e.g., cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer 
lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
• No high-grade cuts have been applied to assay results. Assay results are 
distance weighted using the interval appropriate for each assay. 
• Intersections are reported if the interval is at least 2m wide at 20g/t Ag grade. 
Intersections greater than 2m in downhole distance can contain up to 4m of low 
grade or barren material.  
• No metal equivalent reporting is used or applied. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. If the 
geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature 
should be reported. 
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (e.g., ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
• The intersection width is measured down the hole trace, it is not usually the 
true width. Cross sections in this announcement allow the relationship between 
true and down hole width to be viewed. 
• Data collected from historical workings and shafts within the area and from 
structural measurements from orientated diamond core drilling show the 
primary ore zones to be sub-vertical (nominal east dipping) in nature with a 
general north-south strike. 
• All drill results within this announcement are downhole intervals only and true 
widths are not reported.  
Diagrams 
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being reported. These should include but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• Plan and cross-sectional views are contained within this announcement. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced 
avoiding misleading reporting of Exploration Results. 
• Refer to figures and tables in the body of the ASX release 
• All results >= 20g/t Ag are reported. The results are length weighted 
composites based on the Ag grade and down hole length, a maximum of 4m of 
internal dilution is included. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not 
limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey 
results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• No other exploration data is considered meaningful and material to this 
announcement. 
• The drill program was designed to test various areas of interest identified from interpretation 
and modelling of the historic data pertaining to the Elizabeth Hill Silver Deposit.

Further work 
• The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g., tests for lateral extensions or depth 
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive. 
• Exploration work is ongoing at this time and may involve the drilling of more 
drill holes, both DC and RC, to further extend the mineralised zones and to 
collect additional detailed data on known and as yet unidentified mineralized 
zones.
