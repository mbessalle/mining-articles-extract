We are designing our Santa Cruz Project to be a modern, responsible underground mining operation that will employ a skilled workforce and provide an economic boost to Arizona's growing industrial economy while supporting supply chain independence in the United States for electric metals. The large area of flat land that we are acquiring is ideally suited for renewable solar energy, which we plan to utilize to power our Santa Cruz Project. This important transaction is the culmination of our hard work to reunite the surface land with the subsurface mineral rights we already have the option to acquire, giving Ivanhoe Electric control of a large, high-grade copper project on private land in the Copper State.\"</p><p>Mr. Melvin commented: \"This agreement is a major milestone for our Santa Cruz Project. Acquiring such a large area of private land and associated water rights, in the heart of a growing industrial area near Casa Grande with excellent access to infrastructure including nearby rail, highways and electric transmission lines, is a tremendous advantage for Ivanhoe Electric. Acquiring this land gives our team the flexibility they need to design and develop a minimally disruptive, efficient and modern underground copper mining operation, and provides significant potential for on-site solar power. This land will be a valuable long-term asset for the future of the Santa Cruz Project and our company.\"</p><p>Video footage of the Santa Cruz Copper Project, located just west of Casa Grande and approximately 40 miles south of Phoenix, Arizona. <a href=\"https://pr.report/HQmXnN0t\"><i>Click on the image below for the high-resolution video.</i></a></p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"display:table;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"><a href=\"https://pr.report/4-w3Ce7F\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/754165/image.png\" alt=\"Ivanhoe Electric Inc., Wednesday, May 10, 2023, Press release picture\"></a></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><p><strong>Terms of the Legends Land Acquisition</strong></p><p>Under the terms of the PSA, Ivanhoe Electric will acquire 6,205 acres for a total purchase price of $120.5 million to be paid in installments over a 4.5-year period, as follows:</p><ul><li>$5.0 million deposit, paid upon signing of the PSA;</li><li>$34.3 million payable at the time of closing, expected in May, inclusive of the $5.0 million deposit (the \"First Closing Payment\");</li><li>$34.3 million, plus accrued interest, payable on or before six months following the date of closing (the \"Second Closing Payment\");</li><li>Four equal principal payments of $13.0 million on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Second Closing Payment, plus applicable accrued interest.</li></ul><p>Interest on future payments will accrue at a rate of Prime plus 1%.

Ivanhoe Electric uses its Typhoon&trade; transmitter, an accurate and powerful geophysical survey system, together with advanced data analytics provided by its subsidiary, Computational Geosciences Inc., to accelerate and de-risk the mineral exploration process as well as to potentially discover deposits of critical metals that may otherwise be undetectable by traditional exploration technologies. Through its controlling interest in VRB Energy, Ivanhoe Electric also develops and manufactures advanced grid-scale vanadium redox battery storage systems. Finally, through advancing its portfolio of electric metals projects located primarily in the United States, headlined by the Santa Cruz Copper Project in Arizona and the Tintic Copper-Gold Project in Utah, as well as projects in Montana, Nevada, Oregon and North Carolina, Ivanhoe Electric is also well positioned to support American supply chain independence by delivering the critical metals necessary for electrification of the economy.</p><p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p><p><strong>Investors: Valerie Kimball, Director, Investor Relations 720-933-1150</strong></p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p>Certain statements in this news release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" or \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable US and Canadian securities laws.
