# Nevada Lithium Completes Acquisition of 100% Ownership of Bonnie Claire Lithium Project, Nevada USA with Robust PEA Economics of USD $1.5 Billion NPV (After Tax) and Receives Proceeds from $11.3M Concurrent Financings

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 10, 2023) - Nevada Lithium Resources Inc. (CSE: NVLH) (OTCQB: NVLHF) (FSE: 87K) ("**Nevada Lithium** ") and Iconic Minerals Ltd. (TSXV: ICM) (OTCQB: BVTEF) (FSE: YQGB) ("**Iconic** ") are pleased to announce that they have completed the previously announced plan of arrangement under the _Business Corporations Act_ (British Columbia) (the "**BCBCA** "), whereby Nevada Lithium acquired Iconic's 50% interest in the Bonnie Claire lithium project (the "**Bonnie Claire Project** ") located in Nye County, Nevada (the "**Arrangement** "). Upon completion of the Arrangement, Nevada Lithium now holds a 100% interest in the Bonnie Claire Project. In connection with the completion of the Arrangement Nevada Lithium will receive the gross proceeds from the Concurrent Offerings (as defined below) totalling $11,320,998, which included participation from several investors. 

Stephen Rentschler, Chief Executive Officer of Nevada Lithium, stated: "We are pleased to announce the completion of the previously announced transaction with Iconic resulting in 100% ownership of the Bonnie Claire lithium deposit by Nevada Lithium, and welcome the new shareholders who have been created as a result of this transaction. Nevada Lithium is currently engaged in Pre-Feasibility Study work, as well as strategic dialog with lithium end-users. Consolidation of asset ownership has been one of the key factors in discussions, and we are confident that this transaction will be instrumental in unlocking shareholder value."

Richard Kern, President/CEO of Ionic and Chief Operating Officer and director of Nevada Lithium, added: "The Bonnie Claire lithium deposit has developed into a resource of potential global significance with its size, grade and location in Nevada, USA. Consolidation of 100% ownership within Nevada Lithium will provide a more efficient and effective structure for the continued advancement of the Bonnie Claire Project and allow Iconic shareholders to continue to participate in future value creation as shareholders of Nevada Lithium."

Mr. Rentschler continued, "Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) prices are now many times higher than the assumed prices used in our robust Preliminary Economic Assessment, where at a base case pricing assumption of $13,400 USD / tonne LCE the Bonnie Claire Project returned an NPV of $1.5 Billion USD (ATAX 8%)1. Recent 2022 drill program results have also returned the highest lithium values ever recorded at the Bonnie Claire Project, including 3,201 ppm Li over 520 ft (158 m) within a wider interval of 1,315 ppm Li over 2,000 ft (610 m)2. With a projected annual production rate of over 30,000 tonnes of LCE, and a resource base that indicates the ability to upsize potential production further, the Bonnie Claire Project has the potential to play a significant role in meeting global lithium needs."

**Bonnie Claire Project**

The Bonnie Claire Project is located within Sarcobatus Valley, which is approximately 30 km (19 miles) long and 20 km (12 miles) wide. Quartz-rich volcanic tuffs containing anomalous amounts of lithium occur within and adjacent to the valley. Drill results from the salt flat include 2,054 ppm Li over 67.1 m (220 ft) as well as a 475 m (1560 ft) vertical intercept averaging 1153 ppm Li. Bonnie Claire is one the largest lithium resources in North America with a current NI 43-101 inferred mineral resource of 3,407 million tonnes (Mt) grading 1,013 ppm Li for 18,372 million kilograms of contained lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), at a cut-off grade of 700 ppm Li. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

Nevada Lithium's 2022 NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment shows attractive investment metrics even at low LCE prices. At $13,400 USD per tonne LCE, the Net Present Value of the Project is $1.5 Billion USD (after tax) using an eight percent (8%) discount rate and the Bonnie Claire Project has after tax IRR of 23.8%. With an LCE price of $30,000 USD per tonne, the Net Present Value (8%) of the Bonnie Claire Project is $5.9 Billion USD and the IRR is 60.3% (after tax)3.

The gravity low that characterizes the valley is approximately 20 km (12 miles) long, and the current estimates of depth to basement rocks range from 600 to 1,200 meters (2,000 to 4,000 feet). The current claim block covers an area of 74 km2 (28.6 mi2) with potential for brine systems and further sediment resources.

 _Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) or the Canadian Securities Exchange accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. The TSX Venture Exchange has in no way passed upon the merits of the Arrangement and has not approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release._

_**Cautionary Note to United States Investors**_

 _Iconic prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Terms relating to mineral resources in this news release are defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in CIM Standards. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted amendments effective February 25, 2019 (the "SEC Modernization Rules") to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934._

_As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC will now recognize estimates of "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral resources", which are defined in substantially similar terms to the corresponding CIM Standards. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of "proven mineral reserves" and "probable mineral reserves" to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Standards._

_U.S. investors are cautioned that while the foregoing terms are "substantially similar" to corresponding definitions under the CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that Nevada Lithium may report as "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral resources" under NI 43-101 would be the same had Nevada Lithium prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules._

_In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of "inferred mineral resources" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101._
