The TSX Venture Exchange has in no way passed upon the merits of the Arrangement and has not approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release. Cautionary Note to United States Investors Iconic prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Terms relating to mineral resources in this news release are defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in CIM Standards. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments effective February 25, 2019 (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC will now recognize estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", which are defined in substantially similar terms to the corresponding CIM Standards. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Standards. U.S. investors are cautioned that while the foregoing terms are \"substantially similar\" to corresponding definitions under the CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that Nevada Lithium may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had Nevada Lithium prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation. These statements relate to matters that identify future events or future performance. Often, but not always, forward looking information can be identified by words such as \"could\", \"pro forma\", \"plans\", \"expects\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"potential\" or variations of such words including negative variations thereof, and phrases that refer to certain actions, events or results that may, could, would, might or will occur or be taken or achieved. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to statements regarding: the anticipated benefits and results of the Arrangement; the performance of the Bonnie Claire Project after the completion of the Arrangement (including, without limitation, its mineral resources, current claims and its ability to utilize global lithium needs); and the performance of lithium as a commodity, including the sustained lithium demand and prices. In making the forward looking statements in this news release, Iconic and Nevada Lithium have applied several material assumptions, including without limitation: Iconic obtaining final TSX Venture Exchange acceptance; market fundamentals that result in sustained lithium demand and prices; the receipt of any necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals in connection with the future development of the Bonnie Claire Project in a timely manner; the availability of financing on suitable terms for the development; construction and continued operation of the Bonnie Claire Project; the Bonnie Claire Project containing mineral resources; and Iconic and Nevada Lithium's ability to comply with all applicable regulations and laws, including environmental, health and safety laws. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect Iconic and Nevada Lithium's respective management's expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events based on the opinions, assumptions and estimates of managements considered reasonable at the date the statements are made. Although Iconic and Nevada Lithium believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information involves risks and uncertainties, and under reliance should not be placed on such information, as unknown or unpredictable factors could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by Iconic and Nevada Lithium. Among the key risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are the following: operating and technical difficulties in connection with mineral exploration and development and mine development activities at the Bonnie Claire Project; estimation or realization of mineral reserves and mineral resources, requirements for additional capital; future prices of precious metals and lithium; changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets and in the demand and market price for commodities; possible variations in ore grade or recovery rates; possible failures of plants, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry; delays or the inability of Iconic and Nevada Lithium to obtain any necessary approvals, permits, consents or authorizations, financing or other planned activities; changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting mining operations; currency fluctuations, title disputes or claims limitations on insurance coverage and the timing and possible outcome of pending litigation, environmental issues and liabilities; risks relating to epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, including the impact of COVID-19 on Iconic and Nevada Lithium's business; risks related to joint venture operations; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the Arrangement on relationship, including with regulatory bodies, employees, suppliers, customers and competitors; and risks related to the integration of acquisitions, as well as those factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Iconic and Nevada Lithium's latest Management Discussion and Analysis and other filings of Iconic and Nevada Lithium with the Canadian Securities Authorities, copies of which can be found under the respective party's profile on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com . Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialized, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Although Iconic and Nevada Lithium have attempted to identify important risks, uncertainties and factors which could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be others that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Iconic and Nevada Lithium do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update this forward-looking information except as otherwise required by applicable law.
