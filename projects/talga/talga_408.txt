SUPPLEMENTARY ANNOUNCEMENT 
Acquisition of Octava Minerals’ Talga Project and Exploration Update 
  
 
Global Lithium Resources Limited (ASX: GL1) (GL1 or Company) provides the following supplementary 
information to the ASX release made on 4 December 2024 titled “Strategic Acquisition Consolidates Large 
Scale Gold and Base Metal Target Area”. 
 
The historical drill hole exploration results reported for the Talga Project acquisition from WAMEX report 
numbers A74310 and A77775 included in that ASX release are repeated below.  
 
• 
TPAC079, 16m @ 1.99g/t Au from 0m 
• 
TPAC080, 5m @ 2.23g/t Au from 24m and 8m @ 1.57g/t Au from 50m 
• 
TPAC088, 13m @ 1.79g/t Au from 42m 
• 
TPAC097, 4m @ 4.69g/t Au from 4m 
• 
TPAC101, 2m @ 6.23g/t Au from 28m 
• 
TPAC102, 5m @ 1.63g/t Au from 2m 
• 
TPRC027, 9m @ 1.12g/t Au from 62m 
 
With respect to the above historical exploration results the Company provides the following supplementary 
information and notes the cautionary statement included at page 6 in the 4 December 2024 announcement. 
 
• 
The procedures reported and recording of results in the WAMEX reports appear robust with no 
reason to doubt the reliability of the results reported. The drilling was undertaken by Mining Projects 
Group on behalf of Oakover Gold Limited in 2006 and 2007. 
• 
The shallow reconnaissance Air Core drilling was designed to locate the sub-surface extensions of 
the more obvious gold in soil anomalies at the Razorback gold prospect. Follow on RC drilling tested 
at depth, some mineralised zones outlined by the shallow Air Core drilling. Drilling intersected 
anomalous gold mineralisation identified in structurally controlled zones of variably brecciated cherts, 
silicous / or sulphidic zones. Cross sections, plan view maps, full drilling and assay procedures, are 
outlined in the lodged WAMEX annual reports. 
• 
No further drilling has been undertaken on the Razorback prospect since 2007 and there is no near-
term plan to undertake further exploration drilling work to enable the Razorback exploration drill 
results to be reported in accordance with JORC 2012. The company is planning to undertake detailed 
historic data review and first pass on ground geological mapping programs in 2025. If results warrant, 
further exploration programs will be undertaken which may include drill testing at depth.
