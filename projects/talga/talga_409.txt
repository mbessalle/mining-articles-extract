ASX Announcement 
 
4 December 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
Strategic Acquisition Consolidates Large 
Scale Gold and Base Metal Target Area  
 
Acquisition of Octava Minerals’ Talga Project and Exploration Update 
 
   
Key Highlights 
 
• 
Strategic, low-cost acquisition of the Talga Project from Octava Minerals (ASX: OCT) for $200,000 
cash and $200,000 in Global Lithium Resources (ASX: GL1) ordinary shares based on the 5-day 
VWAP prior to completion. 
• 
Aligns with GL1’s prudent cost management and value-accretive strategy to assess non-lithium 
mineral prospectivity across its largely unexplored portfolio of tenements. 
• 
Consolidation of a 12km trend of gold in soil geochemical anomalies on the northwestern margin 
of the Mt Edgar Batholith. 
• 
Identification of a potential porphyry/Intrusion related Cu-Au mineralised system associated with 
a finger of the Coppin Gap Granodiorite, which is the interpreted source of the Archean Spinifex 
Ridge Mo-Cu-Ag Porphyry Deposit, located 20km away. 
• 
Increased recent corporate activity relating to Pilbara gold project development with Creasy 
Group acquiring nearby Calidus Resources (ASX: CAI) and Northern Star’s (ASX: NST) 
announced intention to acquire De Grey Mining (ASX: DEG).  
• 
Process commenced seeking partners to accelerate and fund further exploration, along with 
previously announced Exploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) grant funding. 
 
 
Established multi-asset Western Australian lithium company, Global Lithium Resources Limited (ASX: 
GL1, Global Lithium or the Company) is pleased to announce the acquisition of seven strategic 
tenements adjacent to the Company’s Marble Bar Gold Project to complete coverage of a large gold in 
soil geochemistry anomaly that is spatially associated with a highly altered granite (Figure 1).  
 
Global Lithium Executive Chairman, Ron Mitchell, said the Talga Project acquisition provided a low-risk, 
cost efficient opportunity for the Company to expand its exposure to gold and base metals within a highly 
prospective region.  
 
“There is no better time for Global Lithium to consolidate and investigate the prospectivity of Talga 
alongside our existing Marble Bar tenements. Interest in the region is high and market conditions for gold 
and base metals are very favourable.

The Manna Lithium Project remains our number one priority; however, we look forward to leveraging our 
in-house capabilities and external partners to unlock value from these additional tenements while the 
lithium market is facing near term challenges. Any future upside from the exploration work at Marble Bar 
will, inevitably, benefit our Manna Project and all Global Lithium shareholders.”    
       
Since listing on the ASX in 2021, GL1 has held the Twin Veins gold prospect area at the northern end of 
its Marble Bar tenement package which currently comprises land area of 537km2. Several small-scale 
exploration campaigns have previously tested vein-hosted gold trends near the margin of granite and have 
returned positive gold results, warranting further exploration.  
 
These previously reported results include; 
 
• 
MBRC0619, 4m @ 4.85g/t Au from 86m1 
• 
MBRC0621, 5m @ 3.94g/t Au from 118m1 
• 
MBRC0623, 3m @ 8.9g/t Au from 49m1 
• 
MBRC0159, 7m @ 4.78g/t Au from 11m2 
• 
MBRC0157, 12m @ 2.95g/t Au from 37m3 
• 
MBRC0006, 3m @ 5g/t Au from 25m3 
 
Review of the prospect area by the Company’s geologists led to the identification of a sericite altered core 
to the granite with iron oxide pitting and minor quartz veins. A Dipole-Dipole Induced Polarisation (DDIP) 
survey was executed over the granite identifying a large chargeable anomaly within resistive granite, and 
several RC holes were drilled targeting this. Disseminated pyrite (~1%) within intensely sericite altered 
granite was intersected with the only significant gold result being reported in a 4m composite sample from 
MBRC0608 (4m @ 0.53g/t Au, 16.9g/t Ag from 220-224m)1.  
 
GL1 has re-assayed the 1m samples from and around this intersection with a result of 5m @ 1.1g/t Au, 
15g/t Ag, 0.3% Pb, 0.23% Zn from 219-224m. MBRC0608 also intersected elevated copper with an 
intercept of 40m @ 137ppm Cu from 156-196m against a background value of 10ppm Cu in other less 
altered areas of the granite. This zone also returned 36m @ 4.8g/t Ag from 164-200m. 
 
To better understand the system two diamond drill holes, MWDD001 and MWDD002, were completed with 
the aim of better visualising the alteration, any mineralisation, and provide samples for petrological study. 
Hole MWDD001 was drilled underneath the altered core of the granite while MWDD002 was successful in 
intersecting the altered core as well as minor mineralisation.  
 
Significant intercepts include: 
MWDD002  
• 
1m @ 1.33g/t Au, 1.6g/t Ag, from 164m and, 
• 
1m @ 0.56g/t Au, 5.6g/t Ag, from 220m and, 
• 
1m @ 1.01g/t Au, 186g/t Ag from 268m and, 
• 
1m @ 9.92g/t Au, 38.7g/t Ag, 0.45% Pb, 2% Zn from 340m

Importantly these intercepts sit within a broad 200m wide silica-sericite-pyrite altered core of the granite, 
which otherwise is dominated by chlorite-epidote alteration. Petrographic analysis on six samples taken 
from MWDD002 has been completed by Microanalysis Australia with observations of high degrees of 
hydrothermal alteration and the identification of sulphide species including pyrite, sphalerite, galena, trace 
chalcopyrite, and trace arsenopyrite. The analysis summary suggests the results indicate the potential for 
a proximally located copper+/- gold porphyry system.

Talga Project Acquisition 
 
GL1 has reviewed the area to the North West of the Mt Edgar Batholith and has the view that there is 
potential that a portion of the top of the known porphyry producing Coppin Gap Granodiorite has been 
preserved by tilting and extensional faulting. The identified alteration and minor mineralisation within the 
granite plug next to the Twin Veins prospect is interpreted to be at an intermediate level within a porphyry 
style mineralised system with a geometry similar to the Spinifex Ridge Porphyry Deposit, dipping shallowly 
to the southeast. The acquisition of the Talga Project provides GL1 with exploration exposure to any 
potential deeper parts of the system, tenements covering prospective ground between Twin Veins and the 
Spinifex Ridge Porphyry Mo-Cu-Ag Deposit, Cord copper prospect, as well as further near surface vein 
hosted gold mineralisation identified at the Razorback Prospect.  
 
• The Talga Project’s Razorback Prospect (Figures 1 and 4) is a 4km long gold in soils geochemical 
anomaly which has been shallowly drill tested based on an interpreted northerly dip with historic results 
found in WAMEX report numbers A74310 and A77775 including; 
 
• 
TPAC079, 16m @ 1.99g/t Au from 0m 
• 
TPAC080, 5m @ 2.23g/t Au from 24m and 8m @ 1.57g/t Au from 50m 
• 
TPAC088, 13m @ 1.79g/t Au from 42m 
• 
TPAC097, 4m @ 4.69g/t Au from 4m 
• 
TPAC101, 2m @ 6.23g/t Au from 28m 
• 
TPAC102, 5m @ 1.63g/t Au from 2m 
• 
TPRC027, 9m @ 1.12g/t Au from 62m 
 
GL1 considers the Razorback Prospect to be significantly under tested and not well understood.  
 
In relation to the historic Razorback Prospect Exploration Results referred to above: 
• 
the Exploration Results have not been reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012. 
• 
a Competent Person has not done sufficient work to disclose the Exploration Results in accordance 
with the JORC Code 2012. 
• 
it is possible that following further evaluation and/or exploration work that the confidence in the prior 
reported Exploration Results may be reduced when reported under the JORC Code 2012. 
• 
nothing has come to the attention of the Company that causes it to question the accuracy or reliability 
of the historical Exploration Results; but 
• 
the Company has not independently validated the previous Exploration Results and therefore is not to 
be regarded as reporting, adopting or endorsing those results.

Next Steps 
 
GL1 is focussed on preserving its strong balance sheet and positioning the Manna Lithium Project to 
progress when market conditions improve. Final approvals are being progressed and key workstreams of 
the DFS are being finalised while some components have been paused. During this time further low-cost 
opportunities to grow the business and achieve accretive value for all shareholders will be assessed and 
considered.  
 
There are further opportunities for non-lithium related mineral exploration associated within the Company’s 
current tenement holdings. These will be progressed based on technical merit and where the required 
spend to advance these opportunities to the next stage of evaluation is considered accretive or where 
third-party funding can be sourced. 
 
The Company is commencing discussions with interested parties who may wish to participate in the Talga 
gold and base metal opportunity by funding further exploration activities. As previously announced, GL1 
has been awarded a $220,000 EIS grant towards two diamond holes to test down dip of the previously 
identified altered granite plug and underneath a gold in soils geochemical anomaly.  
 
Global Lithium General Manager – Geology, Logan Barber, commented:  
“Global Lithium is evaluating several value accretive opportunities for shareholders by progressing its non-
lithium exploration assets whilst in a cyclical lithium market low. The significant amount of gold anomalism 
in soil samples within historical drilling over a large area is intriguing and suggestive of the potential for a 
discovery of scale and significance. The presence of a strongly altered granite, with disseminated pyrite 
and minor gold and base metal mineralisation, which is associated with the causative granite of the Coppin 
Gap Mo-Cu-Ag Porphyry deposit adds further weight to this. The strategic Talga Project acquisition allows 
the company to hold the entirety of the prospective area.”

Sampling 
techniques 
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld 
XRF instruments, etc). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
• Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling 
was used to obtain 1 m samples from 
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 
30 g charge for fire assay’). In other 
cases, more explanation may be 
required, such as where there is coarse 
gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (eg submarine 
nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information.

database and validated prior to use. 
• 
No adjustments made to primary assay data. 
Location of 
data points 
• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to 
locate drill holes (collar and down-hole 
surveys), trenches, mine workings and 
other locations used in Mineral Resource 
estimation. 
• Specification of the grid system used. 
• Quality and adequacy of topographic 
control. 
• 
Prior to drilling, collar coordinates are situated 
using handheld GPS (considered accurate to 
within 3 m). 
• 
DGPS collar surveying is completed post 
program to improve accuracy. 
• 
For the Marble Bar Project the grid used is

The security of the tenure held at the 
time of reporting along with any 
known impediments to obtaining a 
licence to operate in the area. 
• At the Marble Bar Project the newly reported 
drilling is located on tenement E45/4309 and 
E45/4361, which are held 100% Global Lithium.  
• There is no royalty covering the current reported 
drilling results area.

Exploration 
done by other 
parties 
• 
Acknowledgment and appraisal of 
exploration by other parties. 
• The project area has been held by multiple 
parties who have defined gold and base metal 
anomalism over multiple target areas, most 
notably Razorback, Cord, Twin Veins, and 
Douglas Find. Drilling has occurred at shallow 
depths over these three prospect areas. Global 
Lithium considers the narrow focus on shallow 
mineralisation within individual prospects has 
resulted in a potential missed larger scale 
discovery opportunity. 
• Historic drilling data presented from the 
Razorback prospect and referred to in this 
release can be found in WAMEX report 
numbers A74310 and A77775  
• Historic Soil sampling data referred to in this

A 
summary 
of 
all 
information 
material to the understanding of the 
exploration 
results 
including 
a 
tabulation 
of 
the 
following 
information for all Material drillholes: 
• 
easting and northing of the drillhole 
collar 
• 
elevation or RL (elevation above sea 
level in metres) of the drillhole collar 
• 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
• 
down hole length and interception 
depth 
• 
hole length. 
• Diagrams in the announcement show the 
location of and distribution of drillholes. 
• Tables of newly reported drillhole collars and 
significant intercepts are included.

grades) and cut-off grades are 
usually Material and should be 
stated. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation 
with respect to the drillhole angle is 
known, 
its 
nature 
should 
be 
reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down 
hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this 
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’). 
• Exploration is at an early stage at the Marble 
Bar gold project area and as such only down 
hole widths are reported with true widths 
unknown.   
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections 
(with scales) and tabulations of 
intercepts should be included for 
any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but 
not be limited to a plan view of drill 
hole collar locations and appropriate 
sectional views. 
• A plan view drillhole collar map has been 
included in the announcement. 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of 
all 
Exploration 
Results 
is 
not 
practicable, representative reporting 
of both low and high grades and/or 
widths should be practiced to avoid 
misleading reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• Significant gold results at Marble Bar have been 
calculated using a 0.5ppm Au cut-off grade, 
minimum 1m thickness and widths including up 
to 2m internal dilution. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration 
data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful 
and material, should be reported 
including 
(but 
not 
limited 
to): 
geological 
observations; 
geophysical 
survey 
results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk 
samples – size and method of 
treatment; metallurgical test results; 
bulk 
density, 
groundwater, 
geotechnical 
and 
rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious 
or contaminating substances. 
• Dipole-Dipole Induced 
Polarisation survey 
results have been shown in Figure 2. The 
survey and data processing were managed by 
Newexco Exploration. This chargeable target 
has been tested by drilling with results either 
announced previously or included.

geological 
logging 
observations 
highlighting 
significant 
hydrothermal alteration are referred to in this 
release.
