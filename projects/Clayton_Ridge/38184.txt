James Nelson, President of Spearmint Resources stated, "We are pleased to add another project to our Clayton Valley Nevada portfolio at a time when there are potentially several exciting lithium developments ahead. SLB (formerly Schlumberger Limited) is nearing the final stages of testing their lithium brine processing plant on Pure Energy's brine project, where Spearmint's Elon Lithium Brine Project is completely surrounded by Pure Energy's property. Also, regarding Spearmint's McGee Lithium project, which directly borders Century Lithium Corp.'s Clayton Valley Lithium Project, we are expecting developments on Century's collaboration with Koch Technology Solutions on their application of the Li-Pro process for direct lithium extraction. With all these significant developments happening around us in Clayton Valley, combined with our planned upcoming drilling, we feel the second half of 2023 could have a significant impact for our shareholders."

On June 17, 2022, the Company announced that it has received the updated Technical Report and Mineral Resource estimate for the 100-per-cent-owned McGee Lithium Clay Deposit in Clayton Valley, Nevada. The Technical Report included an updated Mineral Resource estimate of 1,369,000 indicated tonnes and 723,000 inferred tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) for a total of 2,092,000 tonnes of LCE, more than doubling the maiden resource estimate announced on June 11, 2021.
