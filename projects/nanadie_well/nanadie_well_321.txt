ASX Announcement
6 March 2025 | ASX: SLS
Completion of Strategic Copper Acquisition
Solstice Minerals Limited (ASX: SLS, Solstice, the Company) is pleased to advise that it has completed the
previously announced purchase of 100% interest in the advanced Nanadie Copper-Gold Project, within
130km2 of granted Mining Lease and Exploration Licence tenure in the Murchison region of WA1.
Highlights
➢ Nanadie has an existing JORC-compliant Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of
40.4Mt @ 0.4% copper and 0.1g/t gold for 162kt of contained copper and 130koz gold1.
➢ The deposit offers strong exploration and MRE growth targets in a shallow mineralised
system that is up to 150m wide and 900m long, and remains under-drilled at its margins,
at depth and along strike.
➢ The Company intends to build on significant previous drill intercepts1 that include:
❖ 107.8m @ 0.91% Cu and 0.24g/t Au from 80.3m in NWD2003, including:
❖ 16m @ 1.65% Cu and 0.42g/t Au, and
❖ 7m @ 2.94% Cu and 0.45g/t Au, and
❖ 13.2m @ 1.05% Cu and 0.56g/t Au
❖ 76m @ 0.85% Cu and 0.39g/t Au from 25m in NWD2004, including:
❖ 10.2m @ 2.61% Cu and 2.06g/t Au
❖ 122.3m @ 0.61% Cu and 0.15g/t Au from 155.9m in NWD2101, including:
❖ 24.6m @ 1.23% Cu and 0.22g/t Au
❖ 81m @ 0.79% Cu and 0.23g/t Au from 16m in NRC05020, including:
❖ 16m @ 2.1% Cu and 0.54g/t Au
➢ Primary chalcopyrite-hosted copper mineralisation makes up 90% of the total MRE and
has potential to deliver a clean copper-gold concentrate with no deleterious elements.
➢ Solstice is very pleased that it now owns a strategic endowment of a metal with an
exceptional long-term demand outlook, secured by a granted Mining Lease in a Tier-1
mining jurisdiction.
Solstice Minerals’ Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Mr Nick Castleden, said:
“We’re delighted to have purchased a rare example of an advanced copper asset with significant exploration
and volume upside which is also located in a stable and infrastructure-rich mining friendly jurisdiction with
limited competing land uses. Copper is widely seen as a commodity with one of the most favourable long-term
supply-demand outlooks of all the major metals, and yet finding quality assets is extremely difficult.
“We have started a full review and targeting process and we are encouraged by the scale, geometry and MRE
growth potential at Nanadie – and the potential for vectors that may deliver zones of increased grade. We are

looking forward to delineating what we are confident will be a series of high-impact drill targets to test in the
coming months.”
Next Steps
The Company has embarked on a comprehensive review of geology and past exploration with the aim
of bringing forward high-impact drill targets to test in coming months. While it is early in the review and
targeting process, the team is excited by the scale, geometry and MRE growth potential at Nanadie, and
the potential to define vectors toward increased grade. Exploration for grade targets will increase
confidence in the overall MRE, while exploration around the periphery of the system is highly likely to
generate additional volume.

About Solstice Minerals
The Company’s West Australian landholdings in WA’s highly endowed greenstone belts are selected for
latent greenfield exploration and development potential. Projects are also typically close to existing
mining operations, with dedicated haul roads and ore processing facilities often within 50–100km. In this
infrastructure-rich region, even modest scale mineralisation has potential to be commercialised, as
underscored by the $10M sale of the Company’s Hobbes tenement in 2024.
The Company continues to work-up quality greenfield and advanced gold targets across its 1,650 square
kilometres of Yarri tenure with a focus on testing positions that offer potential for ‘stand-alone’ scale.
The first-pass aircore drilling campaign is set to continue into 2025 as Exploration Licence applications
are granted.
A robust cash position of $15.1M as at December 20243 (prior to the Nanadie acquisition) provides
Solstice with excellent flexibility to expand its asset base beyond its current projects, and the Company
continues to consider new business development opportunities.
