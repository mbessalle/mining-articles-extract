Solstice Secures Strategic Copper Exposure with
Acquisition of Advanced WA Copper-Gold Project
Highlights
➢ Solstice Minerals Limited has entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with
Cyprium Metals to acquire 100% of the advanced Nanadie Copper-Gold Project, which
lies within 130km2 of granted Mining Lease and Exploration Licence tenure in the
Murchison region, Western Australia.
➢ Nanadie represents a low cost, high leverage copper opportunity underpinned by an
existing JORC-compliant Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 40.4Mt @ 0.4%
copper and 0.1g/t gold for 162kt of contained copper and 130koz gold1.
➢ The deposit sits in a zone up to 150m wide by 900m long, extends to surface and is
under-explored at the margins, depth, and along strike – offering exceptional
exploration upside.
➢ Primary copper mineralisation (90% of the total MRE) is disseminated and veinlet style
chalcopyrite in a mafic intrusive host rock and has the potential to deliver a clean
copper-gold concentrate. No deleterious elements are noted.
➢ Impressive previous drill intercepts demonstrate the strength of the Nanadie
mineralised system:
❖ 107.8m @ 0.91% Cu and 0.24g/t Au from 80.3m in NWD2003, including:
❖ 16m @ 1.65% Cu and 0.42g/t Au from 87m, and
❖ 7m @ 2.94% Cu and 0.45g/t Au from 155m, and
❖ 13.2m @ 1.05% Cu and 0.56g/t Au from 167.8m
❖ 76m @ 0.85% Cu and 0.39g/t Au from 25m in NWD2004, including:
❖ 10.2m @ 2.61% Cu and 2.06g/t Au from 77.8m, and
❖ 59.8m @ 0.63% Cu and 0.15g/t Au from 109m
❖ 122.3m @ 0.61% Cu and 0.15g/t Au from 155.9m in NWD2101, including:
❖ 24.6m @ 1.23% Cu and 0.22g/t Au from 210.6m
❖ 81m @ 0.79% Cu and 0.23g/t Au from 16m in NRC05020, including:
❖ 16m @ 2.1% Cu and 0.54g/t Au from 35m, and
❖ 9m @ 1.57% Cu and 0.56g/t Au from 62m
➢ Solstice sees opportunities to vector toward increased grade and volume and discover
new mineralised positions with targeted exploration drilling.
➢ Solstice is pleased to have secured a strategic copper endowment in a Tier-1 mining
jurisdiction with a clear pathway to delivering resource growth and greenfield
exploration success, all in a metal with an exceptional long-term demand outlook.

Solstice Minerals’ Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Mr Nick Castleden, said:
“We’ve been looking at strategic growth opportunities in copper, particularly focusing on those rare assets that
are located in stable and proven mining friendly jurisdictions with limited competing land use, offer significant
exploration upside and can be secured at a reasonable price. Nanadie ticks all of those boxes and we are
delighted to have secured such a complementary addition to our portfolio. Copper is widely seen as a
commodity with one of the most favourable long-term supply-demand outlooks of all the major metals, and
yet finding quality assets is extremely difficult. We are excited by the scale, geometry and MRE growth potential
at Nanadie, and recognise that mafic magmatic systems like these can also deliver zones of increased grade.
“The Project sits within a granted Mining Lease in a typical flat northern Goldfields setting, with sand-covered
strike extensions that offer greenfield targets for shallow drilling. The dominantly sulphide mineralisation is a
style that lends itself to simple float extraction, and we expect that planned sighter metallurgical test work will
show that a commercial concentrate can be produced. Our medium-term work plan will be exploration-
focused, aiming to scope the mostly unconstrained Nanadie disseminated system beyond MRE boundaries and
explore for new copper-gold mineralisation along strike and at depth.”
Nanadie Copper-Gold Project
Solstice Minerals Limited (ASX: SLS, Solstice, the Company) is pleased to announce the strategic
Acquisition of the advanced Nanadie Copper-Gold Project (the Project) from Cyprium Metals Limited
(Cyprium Metals) (the Acquisition). The Company has entered into a binding Sale and Purchase
Agreement for 100% of the Project which comprises granted licences M51/887, E51/1040, E51/1987, and
L51/124 (the Tenements) covering 130km2 and located 95km south-east of Meekatharra in Murchison
District, Western Australia (Figure 1).

The acquisition includes two significant and partially defined magmatic intrusive style mineral systems,
the Nanadie Cu-Au MRE and the Stark Cu-Au-Ni-PGE Prospect, both secured under granted Mining
Lease title.
Nanadie offers excellent exploration potential to build on a JORC-compliant Inferred MRE of 40.4Mt @
0.4% copper and 0.1g/t gold for 162kt of contained copper and 130koz gold1 (Table 1 and Appendix
1) as the mineralisation potentially extends beyond the limits of previous drilling in most directions.
Mineralisation as currently defined extends from surface to beyond the MRE depth of approximately
255m below surface (Figure 2) and sits in a broad zone up to 150m wide by 900m long in mafic intrusive
rocks (Figure 3).
Figure 2. Nanadie Project long section looking west showing the 2022 MRE boundary, all drilling
and significant copper-gold intercepts in limited step-down diamond drilling to date. Note limited
deeper drilling along the north and south extensions of the system.
Approximately 90% of the MRE is fresh rock mineralisation below 40m depth and comprises
disseminated and veinlet style chalcopyrite (+/- pyrite and pyrrhotite) in predominantly mafic intrusive
host rocks, with long intercepts of >0.20% Cu mineralisation and zones of >1% Cu where vein density
increases (Figure 4).
Mineralised material between surface and 40m depth is predominantly copper oxide styles and contains
local zones of high-grade copper enrichment, with results including 6m @ 4.79% Cu, 0.36g/t Au from 1m
in NRC19005, 8m @ 3.67% Cu, 1.06g/t Au from 28m in NWRC21056, and 11m @ 2.28% Cu, 3.20g/t Au
from 21m in NRC19010.
Examples of cross-sections through the MRE block model are shown in Figures 5 to 8, demonstrating the
relatively unconstrained margins of the mineralised system and the potential for extensions on further
drilling.
All intercepts of greater than 20m downhole length and 0.40% copper grade are tabulated in Table 2.

While metallurgical testwork is yet to be carried out, Solstice considers the style of sulphide
mineralisation to be suitable for conventional grind and flotation processing, with the potential to deliver
a clean copper-gold concentrate. Importantly, no significant deleterious elements are noted in the
available multi-element suite data.
The Company intends to complete sighter metallurgical testwork as new diamond drill core becomes
available.
The Nanadie host mafic intrusive is interpreted to be flanked by granite and gneiss and is also intruded
by post mineral mafic and felsic dykes, a geological picture that means the actual boundaries of the
primary mineralised intrusive are not well constrained. In many places the mineralisation extends
laterally beyond the limits of drilling, or drilling has terminated in a local post-mineral dyke (see Figures
5 to 8).
In addition, primary mafic magmatic systems like Nanadie and Stark have potential to accumulate
sulphides toward the intrusion boundaries and around geometry changes, and Solstice sees
opportunities for further exploration drilling in conjunction with downhole electro-magnetic (DHEM)
surveys to vector toward increased grade and/or discover new mineralised positions.

Extensional Targets
Local geology in the Nanadie and Stark areas is obscured by widespread ironstone gravel, soil and sand
cover and is only partially tested by shallow reconnaissance drill-traverses. Previous shallow RC drilling
along the strike extensions of Nanadie identified copper oxide anomalism with potential to deliver new
mineralised positions, and aeromagnetic imagery shows untested magnetic features similar to the
Nanadie host intrusive (Figure 9).
The Company sees good potential for aircore drilling to identify new mineralisation elsewhere on the
tenure.
More broadly the Project is part of the northern Barrambie greenstone belt, a trend of Archaean rocks
with demonstrated regional prospectivity for magmatic hosted copper-nickel-PGE and titanium-
vanadium mineralisation, as well as lode gold deposits. The Barrambie goldfield lies immediately to the
south-east.
Previous drilling at Nanadie has also identified zones of >1g/t silver anomalism which is generally
coincident with Cu and Au mineralisation. The 2022 MRE reports a total 1.63Moz of silver at an average
1.0g/t Ag (Table 3). A highly mineralised silver intercept of 7m @ 500.8g/t Ag, 0.48% Cu including 2m @
1,470g/t Ag, from 303m in NWD2001 is associated with zone of carbonate-silica veining. The intercept
has not been followed-up and remains open in all directions (Figure 8).

and south of the Nanadie drill-out, and the potential for new mineralisation along untested
magnetic trends.
Previous Exploration
Early exploration targeted the Barrambie greenstone belt for copper, nickel and zinc beginning in the
1970s with Kia Ora Gold and BHP Ltd, but it was not until the mid-1990s during regional reconnaissance
drilling by Newcrest Ltd that the main Nanadie Cu-Au mineralisation was discovered and the Project has
subsequently been held by Dominion Mining Limited, Intermin Resources Limited (now Horizon Minerals
Limited), and most recently Cyprium Metals.
SOLSTICE MINERALS LIMITED ASX Announcement
ASX: SLS 5 February 2025 8

The initial Nanadie RAB discovery hole ER317-13 was drilled by Newcrest in 1996 as part of a single fence
of holes across the now known Mineral Resource. Dominion Mining then drilled further three fences of
exploratory RAB holes at the project in 1999 before lntermin systematically drilled the deposit between
2003 and 2012. Exploration work was continued at Nanadie Well and Stark under a Joint Venture with
Mithril between late 2013 and 2018. Horizon completed further drilling in 2019 before Cyprium acquired
the project from Horizon in September 2020 (Cyprium, 2020b).
The previous operators have drilled a combined 562 drillholes within E51/1040 and M51/887, with an
average hole depth of 57m. Only 21 drillholes are deeper than 200m depth, and none have exceeded
400m depth.
Refer to Table 2 for significant historical intercepts of greater than 10m downhole length and greater
than 0.4% Cu grade, and Table 3 for all historical drillhole details.
Nanadie Mineral Resource Estimate
The following information is disclosed by Solstice in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.8.
The JORC-compliant MRE for Nanadie Well Cu-Au deposit was completed by Cyprium Metals in July 20221
for a total Inferred Resource of 40.4Mt @ 0.4% copper for 162kt of copper, and 0.1g/t gold for 130koz
of gold reported at a 0.25% copper grade cut-off (Table 1). Some 90% of the MRE is sulphide
mineralisation in fresh rock.
A summary of other material information pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 5.8.1 is provided below. Please
refer to the JORC Code (201) Table 1 contained in Annexure 1 for full details of the parameters
pertaining to the existing MRE.
The MRE is modelled from near surface to a nominal depth of 255m below surface.

All the reported Mineral Resource has been classified as an Inferred Resource due to the absence of
detailed bulk density data and uncertainty over the exact location of the first 63 RC drill holes drilled into
the resource area by lntermin prior to 2013.
The Inferred Resource utilised assay results from holes drilled by Horizon, lntermin, Mithril and the
results of infill and extensional drilling programs carried out by Cyprium during 2020 and 2021. Drilling
by Cyprium allowed the deposit to be modelled to a greater depth with the diamond drill holes and

Geology and Geological Interpretation
The Nanadie Well Copper-Gold deposit lies within the Yilgarn Craton and is proximal to the eastern flank
of the Murchison Domain within the broader Youanmi terrane. The Copper-Gold deposit is hosted within
the Barrambie Igneous Complex (BIC) which in turn, is part of the broader Meeline suite. The BIC is
interpreted to be Mesoarchaen age circa 2,810Ma and is intruded by Neoarchaen granites and
granodiorites (Ivanic et al, 2010).
The BIC is a 20km long elongate mafic intrusive sill that parallels a NE- SW trending shear that marks the
eastern margin of the Murchison Domain (Ivanic et al., 2010). The igneous suite is described as east facing
and dipping at ~75 degrees to the east-northeast (Ivanic et al., 2010). At the Nanadie Well deposit, drill
core structural readings have defined a host suite of schists and gneisses that dip steeply to the east-
northeast that are cut by the steep westerly dipping metamorphosed Nanadie Well layered intrusive sill.
The Nanadie Well layered intrusive is composed of highly foliated, upper greenschist facies
metamorphosed gabbro, leucogabbro, anorthosites and pyroxenites that now commonly resemble
amphibolite in hand specimen. Recent drilling by Cyprium indicates that the local schistosity at Nanadie
Well dips steeply (~60 to 80o) to the west-southwest and the bulk of the chalcopyrite mineralisation has
been remobilised by shearing and regional metamorphism into the westerly dipping foliation. The
foliated mineralisation is cut by secondary north-easterly dipping (~50 to60o) sulphide veinlets. These
mineralisation trends were highlighted in the variography, particularly for Cu and Ni.
The Poison Hill Greenstone Belt lies to the east of the ML and consists of mafic units, BIFs and lesser
ultramafic. The Barrambie Greenstone Belt or BIC which hosts the Nanadie Well deposit underlies the
bulk of the Mining Licence and consists of sheared chlorite-quartz-muscovite schists and gneisses that
are intruded by the Nanadie Well Gabbro and ultramafic and by later dolerites and felsic intrusives
(Veracruz, 2019). Granite/granodiorite intrusive bodies flank both sides of Nanadie Well Gabbro as well
as forming irregular granitic dykes and pegmatites that crosscut the earlier mafic intrusives (Figure 10).
There is a thin cover generally 0.5 to 6m of aeolian sands, soil and calcrete. The Nanadie Well Gabbro is
part of the BIC and like the other mafic-ultramafic intrusive sills of the Youanmi terrane, has a basal
ultramafic pyroxenites/peridotites overlain by layered gabbroic sequence of gabbro and leucogabbro,
magnetite bands and lesser anorthosites (Ivanic et al., 2010).
Intermin in 2005 completed a ground magnetic survey over Nanadie that indicates the presence of a
large number of faults. Two of these faults, the 6994800N Fault and 6994930N Fault were modelled. The
modelled faults offset the mineralisation on the north side of each fault from east to west. The ground
magnetic survey suggests that a number of other faults are present. Further, oriented core drilling work
is required to more clearly delineate the faults and refine the domain definition prior to future model
updates. The Cyprium diamond drilling intersected several hydraulically brecciated zones that strike
roughly west northwest to east southeast and dip steeply 80 to 030 degrees. These structures have an
associated Ag, Pb, Mo and Cu mineralising event.

Figure 10. Nanadie geological interpretation (modified from ASX: CYM release 19 July 2022). The
geological boundaries of the primary mineralised intrusive at Nanadie are not well constrained
by drilling.
Geological wireframes were generated to model the mafic intrusive that host the Nanadie mineralisation
and the later cross-cutting felsic intrusive bodies (Figure 10). In addition, a series of DTM surfaces were
generated to model the base of the transitional (BOT) and the base of oxidation (BOX) as well as the base
of the cover (BOC) and the topographic surface. These wireframes were then used to code the Nanadie
Well block model. A total of 6 domains were modelled. These included fresh gabbro and fresh granite
lying below the BOT. The transitional material lying between the BOT and BOX included a transitional
gabbro and transitional granite domain. Material lying between the BOX and BOC was domained as
oxidised gabbro or oxidised granite. The overlying cover material was flagged as cover and
metasedimentary material outside the modelled intrusives was flagged as waste. The modelled blocks
flagged as waste or cover material were assigned a blanket grade of half the lowest reported detection
limit for each modelled element.
Much of the primary layered intrusive fabric at Nanadie Well has been modified by metamorphism and
regional folding and local shearing. The strong metamorphic overprint has made the identification of
primary rock types extremely difficult particularly when logging RC chips. In addition, later felsic dykes
and dolerite dykes that crosscut the gabbroic and pyroxenitic intrusives add an additional level of
complexity to the logging.
The primary copper mineralisation (chalcopyrite) at Nanadie was precipitated from the mafic igneous
melt along with pyrite, pyrrhotite and lesser pentlandite and minor precious metals including gold and
lesser platinum and palladium. The primary disseminated sulphides and precious metals were later
remobilised into the regional shear foliation most likely during regional folding and associated regional
SOLSTICE MINERALS LIMITED ASX Announcement
ASX: SLS 5 February 2025 11

metamorphism. The sulphides were then further remobilised and concentrated into crosscutting NE
dipping vein structures during later structural deformation most likely associated with the emplacement
of the felsic intrusives. The remobilised primary mineralisation was overprinted by a secondary base
metal (sphalerite and lesser galena with accompanying silver) mineralising event again most likely related
to the emplacement of the felsic intrusives.
There also appears to be a late crosscutting mineralising event associated with regional faulting and
hydraulic fracturing that has concentrated silver, copper and lesser Pb and Mo mineralisation. Au
mineralisation is represented locally by the excised Gloria June gold workings that lie 1.7km to the SE of
Nanadie Deposit.
The Nanadie oxidised mineralisation is marked mainly by iron-stained joint surfaces and some secondary
Cu mineralisation dominantly malachite with lesser azurite. Some minor areas of highly weathered rock
are logged in the occasional RC hole as saprolite but generally only within 2 to 10m of surface. The
transition zone is less clearly defined and has been domained based on the transition from weakly or
partially weathered to fresh rock. In places, the copper grade was elevated around the interpreted BOT
boundary suggesting the possible presence of secondary copper sulphide (chalcocite and/or covellite)
minerals though none are described from the RC chip logging.
Drilling Techniques
The Cyprium Ordinary Kriged 2022 resource model is based on geological information from 184 drill
holes and assay data from 145 RC holes and 6 diamond drill holes. Only assays from holes drilled by
Intermin (77 RC), Mithril Resources (1 DDH) and Cyprium (68 RC & 5 DDHs) since 2004 were used in the
resource estimation. The initial Intermin drilling between 2003 and 2012 was completed on 40 to 50m
spaced sections with a nominal 20-30m sectional hole spacing. The subsequent Cyprium drilling closed
the sectional drill spacing to a nominal 20 to 25m whilst maintaining a 20-30m sectional hole spacing.
Horizon completed one additional 14-hole RC drill programme in 2019. Mithril drilled a single diamond
drill hole at Nanadie Well in 2017. Cyprium completed 4 DDHs in 2020 and a fifth hole in early 2021. In
addition, Cyprium drilled 68 RC holes in 2021.
Drill hole collars were surveyed in GDA94 zone 50 coordinates using hand-held Garmin GPS units and
where possible, later surveyed using a Real-time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK GNSS)
for greater accuracy to +/- 0.5m. Less than half the Intermin drill hole collars (20) were relocated and
surveyed in detail using the RTK GNSS by Mithril as was the Mithril DDH. All Cyprium drill hole collars
were initially positioned with a hand-held Garmin GPS unit and then later surveyed by Arvista Surveys
using a Hemisphere S321+ RTK GNSS.
Intermin only completed down hole surveys with a magnetic multi-shot tool on 21 of the RC drill holes
drilled prior to 2013. The down hole survey details for the remaining 42 RC holes were based solely on
handheld compass surface readings for azimuth and a clinometer reading for dip. The RC holes drilled
by Horizon in 2019 were down hole surveyed with a Gyro. Mithril used a magnetic Reflex Ezyshot survey
tool to survey their single DDH. Cyprium used an Axis Multi-shot north seeking Gyro tool to survey all the
DDHs and an Axis Single-shot Gyro tool to survey all the RC holes.
Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques
Intermin completed several RC drill campaigns at Nanadie well between 2004 and 2006 as well as in
2011-2012 and again in 2019. Four metre composite RC drill samples were prepared by thrusting a PVC
spear (75mm diameter) to the bottom of the green plastic RC bag and then taking a single metal scoop
SOLSTICE MINERALS LIMITED ASX Announcement
ASX: SLS 5 February 2025 12

from each of the 4 speared samples to create the initial 4m composite sample for assay. Additionally, 1m
single splits (1.5 to 2kg) were taken off the rig mounted cyclone/splitter unit. These sample splits were
sent for assay if and when anomalous Cu and Au assays were reported from the initial composite sample.
The splitter/cyclone was routinely cleaned to avoid sample contamination.
Mithril drilled a single HQ3/NQ2 diamond drillhole in 2017. Half core samples were taken based on
geological intervals varying from 0.25 to 1.0m. The top 37.95m (partially oxidised) and last 59.95m (all
logged as granite) were not sampled.
The Cyprium 2020/21 drill core programme included 5 HQ3 DDHs for 1327.5m of core drilling. The holes
were drilled at irregular spacings from 40 to 200m apart. Holes were drilled to confirm the geology on
the targeted sections and provide the first orientated drill core structural data for the project with the
core also providing material for an initial round of metallurgical tests. The core was logged in detail,
photographed and then cut onsite for analysis with quarter core analysed and half core being utilised for
metallurgical testing and the orientation lined quarter kept as a permanent reference.
During the 2021 RC programme, Cyprium collected 1m samples weighing 3.0kg from the splitter on the
NDRC drill rig. A second 3.0kg reference sample split was also taken and retained by Cyprium at the
Nanadie Well core yard. The drill cyclone/splitter and sampling buckets were cleaned between individual
rod changes and after each drill hole had been completed to minimise down-hole and cross-hole sample
contamination. Additional cleaning was undertaken if any wet sample material was encountered. Two
3kg to 5kg calico bagged samples are collected directly from the drill rig cone splitter. The split was a 10%
offtake from the cyclone. One sample was retained on site for reference purposes and the other utilised
for assaying. No low sample return was reported by Cyprium geologists during the January 2021 drilling
campaign.
Sample Analysis Method
Intermin RC samples submitted prior to 2013 were all approximately 1.5 to 2kg in weight. The samples
collected between 2003 and 2006 were sent via Centurion transport in Meekatharra to Ultratrace
Laboratories in Canningvale. The samples were analysed with an aqua regia digest and analysed by ICP-
MS for Au, Cu, Pb, Zn and Ag. The 2011-2012 samples were analysed by Aurum laboratories, Perth. A 4-
acid digestion was used for the Au and Cu analyses with an ICP-MS finish. Intermin completed random
50g charge check fire assays for Au.
The Mithril 2017 HQ3/NQ2 diamond drill programme half core samples weighed 1.0 to 3.0kg. These were
analysed by ALS Laboratories in Perth, WA. Each sample interval was assayed for Au using a 30g charge
fire assays and an ICP-AES (ICP21 methodology). An ICP multielement suite was used to complete base
metal and gangue mineral analyses of intervals with visible sulphides. A 1g sub-sample was dissolved
with a 4-acid digest and read using the 33 element ME- ICP61 methodology.
The Horizon 2019 RC samples were analysed at Aurum laboratories, Au was analysed with 50g fire assays
with aqua regia digest and a 3-acid digest with AAS finish was used for the Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Ni and Co
analyses.
The 2020/21 diamond drill core samples were quarter core samples. The samples were submitted to
Bureau Veritas Canningvale, WA for precious metal analyses and base metal and a limited multielement
suite. The core samples were jaw crushed to 3mm and then pulverised to 75% passing 105 microns. The

Mo, Pb, Sb and Tl assays were completed with method ICP302 (ICP-MS finish). The analyses for Al, Ca, Cr,
Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, S, Ti and Zn assays were completed with method ICP102 (ICP-OES finish). All
precious metal assays for Au, Pt and Pd were completed by FA002 (40 g FA with ICP-OES finish)
methodology.
Cyprium sampling techniques are considered by the company to be industry standard for the 2021 RC
drilling programme. 3kg RC samples have been submitted to Bureau Veritas Canning Vale, WA for gold
and base metal analysis. Samples were crushed and pulverised, then 40g subsampled and fire assayed
with AAS finish (FA001) for Au, Pt and Pd; a mixed acid digest (MA200) with ICP-OES finish (MA201) was
used for Cu, Ni, Zn and S and ICP-MS finish (MA202) was used for Ag, Co and Pb analyses.
Quality control data was collected from CYM and Mithril core drilling and included the use of blanks,
certified standards and lab duplicates. Detailed review of the QA/QC data determined that the results
were satisfactory and that the drilling database was suitable for resource estimation. Similarly, CRMs and
blanks were inserted with the Cyprium RC sample submissions.
Intermin/Horizon did not include any CRMs, blanks or field duplicates with any of their analysis jobs and
relied entirely on Ultratrace and Aurum Laboratories internal QA/QC methodology which included CRMs,
Blanks and Duplicates. They reviewed all the laboratories internal QA/QC checks and concluded that
there were no evidence of assaying or sampling irregularities.
Estimation Methodology
The Nanadie mineralisation was modelled using Micromine software. The mineralisation models were
defined by lithological boundaries and reported at a 0.25% Cu cut-off. The drill hole assay file was coded
against the geology domain wireframes (Figure 10). The coded raw assay file was then composited at the
dominant sampled interval of 1m. The raw assay file was used to generate down hole semi- variograms
for each of the six modelled domains to determine the nugget values for each of the six elements in each
of the six domains. Histogram and Probability plots were generated for each of the six modelled elements
again for each domain. These were examined to determine top-cut values for each element from within
each domain. The drill hole composite file was used to generate directional pairwise semi-variogram
models for each of the six elements for each of the six domains. The variogram models were then used
to drive subsequent Ordinary Kriged model runs. The ranges of the modelled search ellipse axes were
progressively expanded between model runs until all the blocks in the Nanadie Well block modelled had
an estimated value for each modelled element. The Nanadie Well block model used 10mN x 5mE x 5mRL
block sizes with sub-blocking to 1/10th of the parent block size allowed.
The reported Inferred Resource only included blocks estimated in the first 3 model runs for the 3 Gabbro
domains where the average kriging distance for the Cu block estimate was less than or equal to 150m.
At least 12 samples from at least 3 different holes were used to estimate a block grade and the slope of
regression for the estimated block was greater than or equal to 0.65. A wireframe shell was created
around these Gabbro blocks and any granitic dyke blocks not estimated in one of the first 3 runs but still
lying within the Gabbroic Inferred Grade shell were then included as part of the Inferred Resource. This
was done to avoid having uninformed blocks in the middle of the Resource Shell. The highly irregular
shape and local narrowness of the cross-cutting felsic dykes has meant that the estimation process locally
struggled to find enough sample pairs to estimate these internal blocks in the first 3 model runs.
All material outside the Inferred Resource shell was left Unclassified with these peripheral blocks being
used to highlight structural trends and aid targeting of future drilling along strike and down dip.

The applied top-cuts affected very few samples - less than 1% of samples in the Fresh Gabbro and
Oxidised Gabbro Domains and less than 5% in the Transitional Gabbro Domain. From the Fresh Granite
Domain, less than 2% of values were cut while from the Oxidised Granite Domain, less than 1% of
samples were cut. From the Transitional Granite Domain, less than 3% of the Cu and Au values were cut
but up to 13% of the Zn and Ag values were cut and up to 6% of the Co and Ni values were cut. The limited
number of assays particularly for Ag, Co, Ni and Zn produced a more irregular distributed sample
population for this domain and this resulted in a harder cut for these four elements in the Granite
Transitional Domain.
The only previous Mineral Resource Estimate for Nanadie Well was produced by Intermin in 2013. The
limited detail surrounding this estimate can be viewed in the Intermin 2013 historic ASX release with
details also included in an ASX: CYM release (Cyprium, 2020a). The Cyprium Inferred Resource was in line
with the historical release by Intermin. The Cyprium Mineral Resource estimate includes data from an
additional 82 RC and 6 diamond drill holes but excluded assay data from 25 RAB holes utilised in the
previous Mineral Resource estimate. The overall drill spacing was closed to a nominal 25m x 25m drill
pattern since the initial MRE in 2013.
No mining activity has occurred at Nanadie Well, so no production and reconciliation records are not
available for the deposit.
No modelling of selective mining units was undertaken, and the MRE is a global estimate. Future studies
would look to generate preliminary pit shells to assess the project’s development potential and to better
restrict the Mineral Resource estimation to the area that has a reasonable chance of being mined using
open pit mining method for oxide Cu and/or sulphide Cu extraction. This work would highlight areas
requiring closer spaced drilling to convert the current Inferred Resource to a Measured and Indicated
Resource status with additional drilling and sampling. Any additional drilling would also aid planned
sighter metallurgical studies and preliminary geotechnical assessments.
The Nanadie mineralisation is localised within the mafic intrusive bodies with some limited secondary
migration of Cu and Ni sulphides into the cross-cutting felsic intrusives. The mafic units have been
modelled as Gabbroic domains separated into Fresh Gabbro Domain (fresh gabbro, norite, pyroxenite,
peridotite and cross-cutting dolerite), Gabbro Transitional Domain (partially oxidised material) and
Gabbro Oxidised Domain (material logged as more intensely oxidised). The cross-cutting granitic and
pegmatitic dykes and flanking more massive granitic bodies were also separated into fresh, transitional
and oxidised domains. The disseminated primary sulphide mineralisation has been remobilised into the
shear fabric with secondary cross-cutting sulphide veins also developed.
Validation
To validate the estimation, the block model and drillholes were compared on screen in Micromine. It was
noted that grades and trends visible in the drilling were reflected in the block model. A series of swath
plots were generated to compare block grades with composite grades and showed good correlation
between the two datasets. The global composite mean grade for each domain was compared with the
block model grade for the same domain. Generally, these compared reasonably well with the exception
of Ag and Zn for Granite Transitional Domain and Zn for the Granite Oxidised Domain where the
modelled grade was higher than the corresponding composite grade. This is most likely a reflection of
the limited number of intercepts in the domain. The uncut Ag values for the Gabbro Primary Domain
showed a broad difference as did the uncut Zn values for the Gabbro Transitional Domain indicating that
a few high-grade intercepts in each of these 2 domains have a significant impact. The Cu and Au grades
SOLSTICE MINERALS LIMITED ASX Announcement
ASX: SLS 5 February 2025 15

were generally slightly higher from the mean drill hole composite values than the blocks from the same
domain.
Model Bulk Density
No systematic bulk density measurements have been carried out on the Nanadie Well drill holes.
Immersed water bulk density measurements were determined by Cyprium on five of the Nanadie Well
diamond drill holes. Bulk Density values were estimated for each domain based on globally reported
figures for granitic/granodioritic (2.72 g/cm3) and gabbro/peridotite (3.1 g/cm3) intrusives (Berkman,
2001). These figures were then adjusted down based on the depth extent and observed level of oxidation.
The figure used for the cover material was based on a bulk density determination generated from a
sample of locally sourced surface cover material. The surface sample was collected in a known volume
and then weighed dry to determine a local bulk density figure 1.61 g/cm3. A blanket number of 2.69
g/cm3 was used for fresh gneiss and schists. These numbers were factored down by an additional 2.5%
for every 5m of vertical depth above the BOT. The average block model bulk density for the Cyprium
Inferred Resource was 3.06 g/cm3.
Mineral Resource Classification
All material was classified as Inferred due to the absence of detailed bulk density data and uncertainty in
the identification of the lithological units in RC chip logging. This coupled with structural complexity
means that the modelled domains are broad and do not adequately account for local variability. Further,
the absence of down hole surveys for 42 of the first 63 Intermin RC holes and the absence of Differential
GPS collar surveys for 43 of these first 63 RC drill hole introduces an extra degree of spatial uncertainty.
The absence of detailed bulk density data coupled together with the spatial uncertainty surrounding the
first 63 RC holes influenced the decision to classify the modelled resource as an Inferred Resource. This
is despite the relatively close spacing of the Nanadie Well drilling on a nominal 20 to 30m x 20 to 30m
grid pattern. The proximity of the modelled Inferred Resource to surface means that there is a very
reasonable chance that this material can realistically be mined utilising open cut drill and blast mining
methods. Also, that additional drilling and greater confidence in the bulk density data will allow the
company to convert a substantial proportion of the modelled Resource to Indicated and Measured
Resource categories. Material outside the currently estimated Inferred Resource was omitted due to the
lower confidence in those modelled blocks mainly due to lack of drill information or more broadly spaced
drill data. Though the trends observed in the modelling suggest that there is a reasonable chance that
step-out drilling will identify additional material along strike and down dip of the current MRE.
Cut-off Grades
The Mineral Resource Estimate used a 0.25% Cu cut-off which was determined by Cyprium’s preliminary
estimations and based on the results that Company had achieved from ongoing mining studies and
metallurgical tests at its other projects (Cyprium, 2022) and was considered the approximate break-even
grade for mining and processing Nanadie material at the time.
Metallurgy
Sighter metallurgical test work is planned with half core samples from the first five of Cyprium’s HQ3 drill
holes suitable for use in this work. The planned test work may look at sulphide extraction to floatation
SOLSTICE MINERALS LIMITED ASX Announcement
ASX: SLS 5 February 2025 16

processing and also consider the viability of heap leaching the Nanadie oxide mineralisation and possible
recovery via SX/EW processes.
Modifying Factors
The Company considers that the Mineral Resource at Nanadie could be mined using conventional open
cut techniques but further drilling and associated geological evaluations are required along with
metallurgical testing, environmental studies and geotechnical evaluation to confirm this view. The first
step will be to continue to define the parameters and geometry of the mineralised system, and local
geological variability. More detailed drilling may look to convert some or all the current reported Inferred
Resource to Indicated and Measured status to permit more detailed mine planning and economic
evaluations to be undertaken.

About Solstice Minerals
The Company’s West Australian landholdings in WA’s highly endowed greenstone belts are selected for
latent greenfield exploration potential. Projects are also typically close to existing mining operations, with
dedicated haul roads and ore processing facilities often within 50–100km. In this infrastructure-rich
district, even modest scale mineralisation has potential to be commercialised, as underscored by the
$10M sale of the Company’s Hobbes tenement in 2024.
The Company continues to work-up further quality greenfield gold targets across its 1,650 square
kilometres of Yarri tenure with a focus on testing positions that offer potential for ‘stand-alone’ scale. The
first-pass aircore drilling campaign is set to continue into 2025 as Exploration Licence applications are
granted.
With an extensive belt-scale footprint in WA’s Eastern Goldfields, the Company continues to offer strong
leverage to gold and copper exploration success.
A robust cash position of $15.1M as at December 20242 (equivalent to 15c per share) provides
Solstice with excellent flexibility to expand its asset base beyond its current projects, and the Company
continues to review a number of compelling business development opportunities.

expected to return reasonable grade. No secondary core splits have
been analysed at a second laboratory. The laboratory also reported the

that the samples were representative, though some bias may occur in
areas of poor sample recovery, which was logged, though rarely

near 100% to EOH.
The 2020-2021 Cyprium Metals drill logs included details of lost core and
recoveries were recorded for each logged interval as part of the
geotechnical logging process. The recoveries were excellent across all 5
holes. Hole NWD2001 had very poor recovery through the surface cover

Cyprium has corrected some assay data entry errors utilising the

drill logs. The bulk of these errors relate to the Ag, Co, Ni, Pb, As and Zn

A total of 65 intervals had no Cu assays. These missing samples occurred
at the start or end of holes in 39 instances. While 13 intervals had been
partially sub-sampled utilising the original 1m sample splits, these zones
had an overriding 4m composite assay. In these 13 instances, it was
found that only 1 to 3 of the original 1m sub-samples had been sent for
secondary assay by lntermin, leaving some 1m intervals without a
second assay result. The missing assay value was calculated using the
original 4m composite assay and available 1m sub-sample assay to
generate an adjusted value for the unsampled portion of the original
4m composite interval. On the 3 occasions that the back calculation
produced a negative assay value, in these instances the resulting
calculated value was adjusted to half the detection limit for that
element. Any unsampled or missed intervals (possibly lost samples)
were left as blank assay fields. A total of 231 intervals had no Au assay
data. The same 13 intervals from mid hole that also had limited Cu data
and 15 intervals from the top or bottom of holes with no assay data. A
further 203 intervals, mainly from the top of Cyprium diamond holes,
were not assayed as whole core samples through the oxide profile and
were preserved for metallurgical testing. A much larger number of

Information provided by all previous project operators indicate that no
data was adjusted.
Cyprium did not adjusted any of the 2020 or 2021 data.
Cyprium has corrected some assay data entry errors utilising the
original raw laboratory files and has also corrected some issues
surrounding the recording of unsampled interval issues and below
detection limit values, again with reference to original assay files and the
drill logs. The bulk of these errors relate to the Ag, Co, Ni, Pb, As and Zn
data.
A total of 65 intervals had no Cu assays. These missing samples occurred
at the start or end of holes in 39 instances. While 13 intervals had been
partially sub-sampled utilising the original 1m sample splits, these zones
had an overriding 4m composite assay. In these 13 instances, it was
found that only 1 to 3 of the original 1m sub-samples had been sent for
secondary assay by lntermin, leaving some 1m intervals without a
second assay result. The missing assay value was calculated using the
original 4m composite assay and available 1m sub-sample assay to
generate an adjusted value for the unsampled portion of the original
4m composite interval. On the 3 occasions that the back calculation
produced a negative assay value, in these instances the resulting
calculated value was adjusted to half the detection limit for that
element. Any unsampled or missed intervals (possibly lost samples)
were left as blank assay fields. A total of 231 intervals had no Au assay
data. The same 13 intervals from mid hole that also had limited Cu data
and 15 intervals from the top or bottom of holes with no assay data. A
further 203 intervals, mainly from the top of Cyprium diamond holes,
were not assayed as whole core samples through the oxide profile and
were preserved for metallurgical testing. A much larger number of
intervals were not assayed for Ag (1418), Co (3175), Ni (1885) or Zn (980).
No adjustments have been made to the Au, Ag, Co, Ni or Zn data. |  |

Geology Deposit type, geological setting and style The project lies within the Yilgarn Craton and is proximal to
of mineralisation. the eastern flank of the Murchison Domain within the
broader Youanmi terrane.
The Nanadie Copper-Gold deposit is hosted within the
Barrambie Igneous Complex (BIC) which in turn, is part of the
broader Meeline suite. The BIC is interpreted to be
Mesoarchaen age, circa 2810Ma, and is intruded by
Neoarchaen granites and granodiorites (lvanic et al., 2010).
The BIC is a 20km long elongate mafic intrusive sill that
parallels a NE-SW trending shear that marks the eastern
margin of the Murchison Domain (lvanic et al., 2010). The
igneous suite is described as east facing and dipping at 75°
to the east-northeast (lvanic et al., 2010). At the Nanadie Well
deposit, drill core structural readings have defined a host
suite of schists and gneisses that dip steeply to the east-
northeast that are cut by the steep westerly dipping
metamorphosed Nanadie Well layered intrusive sill. The
Nanadie Well layered intrusive is composed of upper

The Nanadie Copper-Gold deposit is hosted within the
Barrambie Igneous Complex (BIC) which in turn, is part of the
broader Meeline suite. The BIC is interpreted to be
Mesoarchaen age, circa 2810Ma, and is intruded by
Neoarchaen granites and granodiorites (lvanic et al., 2010).
The BIC is a 20km long elongate mafic intrusive sill that
parallels a NE-SW trending shear that marks the eastern
margin of the Murchison Domain (lvanic et al., 2010). The
igneous suite is described as east facing and dipping at 75°
to the east-northeast (lvanic et al., 2010). At the Nanadie Well
deposit, drill core structural readings have defined a host
suite of schists and gneisses that dip steeply to the east-
northeast that are cut by the steep westerly dipping
metamorphosed Nanadie Well layered intrusive sill. The
Nanadie Well layered intrusive is composed of upper
greenschist facies metamorphosed gabbro, leucogabbro,
anorthosites and pyroxenites.

of the basis of the metallurgical
assumptions made. |  |  | Metallurgical test work is planned with half core samples

factors or
assumptions |  |  | Assumptions made regarding possible
waste and process residue disposal options.
It is always necessary as part of the process
of determining reasonable prospects for
eventual economic extraction to consider
the potential environmental impacts of the
mining and processing operation. While at
this stage the determination of potential
environmental impacts, particularly for a
greenfields project, may not always be well
advanced, the status of early consideration
of these potential environmental impacts
should be reported. Where these aspects
have not been considered this should be
reported with an explanation of the
environmental assumptions made. |  |  | Environmental factors have not been considered in detail
at this point in time. It is envisaged that waste rock will be
conventionally stockpiled in a contoured waste dump by
the open pit mining equipment. Potentially acid forming
waste material will be identified during future feasibility
studies and encapsulated as part of any future open cast
mining process.
Process waste will be encapsulated in the heap leach pads.
The primary cost is incurred when building the pads and
has been considered as has the costs of encapsulating and
generating a self-sustaining landform for mine closure.
No flora and fauna studies have been undertaken at this
point in time. Further studies may be commissioned by the
Company during future feasibility studies. |  |
