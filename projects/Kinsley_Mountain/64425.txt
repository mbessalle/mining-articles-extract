# CopAur Minerals Signs Indicative Term Sheet to Acquire Remaining 18.74% Interest in Kinsley Mountain Gold Project

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 8, 2024) - CopAur Minerals Inc. (TSXV: CPAU) (OTCQX: COPAF) ("**CopAur** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to announce that it has signed a non-binding indicative term sheet with Nevada Sunrise Metals Corporation ("**Nevada Sunrise** ") to acquire Nevada Sunrise's 18.74% ownership interest in the Kinsley Mountain Gold Project in Nevada ("**Kinsley Project** "). If the transaction is completed CopAur will own 100% of the Kinsley Project.

The indicative term sheet outlines a potential transaction whereby CopAur will acquire Nevada Sunrises' 18.74% ownership interest in the Kinsley Project in consideration of the payment of CDN$475,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares of CopAur. The shares will be deposited in escrow and will be released in successive releases of 250,000 shares once every calendar quarter commencing after expiry of the four-month statutory hold period after the closing date. The terms are indicative, and the final terms are subject to the negotiation and completion of a definitive agreement on terms acceptable to CopAur and Nevada Sunrise. The transaction will be subject to several conditions including CopAur arranging a financing in the amount of a minimum of CDN$475,000, completion of satisfactory due diligence and the fulfilment of various closing conditions, including acceptance by the TSXV. 

Chief executive officer Jeremy Yaseniuk stated: _"Acquiring the remaining 18.74% ownership interest in the Kinsley Project will provide us with full control over the project and the ability to concentrate our efforts on advancing this exciting project. We completed reverse circulation and diamond core drilling program in late 2023 at Kinsley Mountain within the Main Pit North area located one kilometre southeast of the Western Flank Zone which intersected high grade near-surface oxide gold intercepts with the gold hosting Dunderberg shale 75 metres outside the current resource pit shell providing opportunities for near pit resource expansion. We now hope to initiate the integrated exploration data analysis to further advance the understanding of the Kinsley Project mineralization that will increase the efficiency and robustness of future exploration, targeting resource definition and development work."_

The Kinsley Project hosts current mineral resources that CopAur is working to upgrade and expand. The Kinsley Project was a historical past producer that yielded 138,000 ounces of near-surface open-pit oxide gold between 1995 and 1999.

A technical report on the Kinsley Project titled "Technical Report of the Kinsley Project, Elko and White Pine Counties, Nevada, U.S.A.", dated June 21, 2021, with an effective date of May 5, 2021, prepared by Michael M. Gustin and Gary L. Simmons, is available for review under New Placer Dome Gold Corp.'s issuer profile on SEDAR+.
