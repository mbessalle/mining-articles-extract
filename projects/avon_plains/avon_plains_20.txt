OPTION TO ACQUIRE HISTORICAL HIGH-GRADE GOLD
PROJECT
Highlights
• Bubalus granted option to acquire a further portfolio of Victorian exploration licences
covering approximately 1,063 km2 in close proximity to the operating, high-grade
Stawell and Kingston gold mines.
• Licences contain the Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine.
• Despite reported high-grade gold production in the late 1800s and early 1900s this
gold occurrence is not listed in various Victorian online databases.
• Avon Plains Licence is largely covered by shallow Murray Basin sediments – a key
target area identified through the Victorian “Gold Undercover” study series.
• Bubalus plans to conduct a drilling program aimed at delineating gold bearing reef
orientation, extent and grade.
• Landholder access agreement in place to allow near term execution of this drilling.
• Bubalus will implement a broad-based geochemical sampling program across the
remainder of the licence areas targeting new discoveries, and recorded gold
occurrences.
Bubalus Resources Limited (ASX: BUS) (Bubalus or the Company) is pleased to announce the
proposed acquisition of 100% of a portfolio of granted exploration licences located in the Stawell Zone
of the Victorian goldfields.
The primary licence, Avon Plains (EL007115), is located north of operating mines at Stawell, and a
high-grade small scale operation at Kingston (Figure 1).
The Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine is located on farmland within the granted Exploration Licence
EL007115, located approximately 30 km west of St Arnaud in central western Victoria. Despite local
knowledge of the remaining historic mine shaft, the mine and associated gold occurrences are not
noted in Victorian online databases. Importantly, the Vendor has a land access agreement in place
with the landholder.

The historic shaft at Avon Plains is situated at the northern boundary of the Pyrenees Gold Province,
which contains several sediment hosted goldfields, the closest of which is the St Arnaud Goldfield,
centered around the township of St Arnaud, 30 km to the east (Figure 2). Gold is hosted in quartz
reefs associated with dykes along steep southwest dipping faults cutting sandstones and slates. The
closest recorded mine site is 22.5 km east of the historic shaft, in the St Arnaud goldfield, with the
operating Kingston Gold Mine located 30 km to the south. The Avon Plains Historic Mine area is
predominantly covered in tertiary fluvial, alluvial and paludal sands, silts and clays and Cambrian
marine sandstones, siltstones and biotite schists of the St Arnaud Group, which also hosts the gold
occurrences of the St Arnaud Goldfield. Outcrop is sparse, suggesting the area could be
underexplored, providing an opportunity for new discoveries beneath the shallow cover. The Stawell
Zone, including the Avon Plains Gold Project, was featured in the Gold Undercover study conducted
by the Victorian government in 20091, which identified potential for 33 undiscovered mineralisation
fields within the undercover section of the Stawell Zone in Victoria (Figure 3).

Summary of Historical Information
The local Historical Society was tasked (by the Vendor) with uncovering information relating to the
Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine, and discovered several newspaper articles and reports from which
the following information is summarised. Bubalus has verified most of these sources and discovered
further information through the course of due diligence in relation to this transaction.
• A claim was pegged in the 1890s following the discovery of traces of gold in a quartz ridge.
• Two shafts were sunk, 450 feet apart, with crosscuts to the reef. (No 2. Shaft remains and
was located during the recent site visit. No. 1 shaft is believed to have been located about 150
m north and has since been filled in for cropping purposes) (Figure 4).
• The reef width was stated to be between 15 inches and two feet, and sometimes up to three
to four and a half feet wide.
• Excessive water caused issues from a depth of 60 feet, becoming more troublesome as the
depth increased. By two to three hundred feet continuously worked bailing tanks could no
longer keep up with water removal. The mine was forced to close due to the heavy expenditure
required to deal with water flow in approximately 1907.2
Cautionary Statement – Historical Exploration Results
The historical information presented in this release regarding the Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine has
been obtained from secondary sources, such as newspaper articles and local history books, published
between 1894 and 1924. No primary exploration data from the late 1800s and early 1900s has been
obtained by Bubalus. Copies of historic reports provided by the Vendor have been viewed by the
Competent Person. Digitally available historical information has been verified and obtainment of
original copies of non-digitally available sources is in progress.
One of the Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine shafts was visually verified by the competent person during
a site visit in February 2025. Despite the existence of the shaft and historic reports of the mine, no
gold occurrence or production centre is marked in open file Victorian Government data. Two ~0.12
km2 historic mining licences (GML6194MR and GML7011AR), which surround the historic shaft, have
been located by Bubalus, however no additional details such as licence dates, company details or
target commodities are available.
The fact that there is evidence of a producing gold mine with very little available data is a key factor
in the Company’s decision to explore the Avon Plains area, as the lack of information may present an
opportunity to rediscover gold mineralisation that has been lost to history and overlooked by more
recent explorers.
Due to the age and nature of the available historic information any estimates of the style, grade and
orientation of the Avon Plains Historic Gold Mine mineralisation are not able to be reported in
accordance with the 2012 Edition of the JORC Code. Based on historical information the Company is
able to conclude the prospectivity of the area, however, any reliance on grade and production
information is not advised, as it has not been able to be verified by a Competent Person under the
JORC Code 2012.

Recent Exploration – Avon Plains
The Vendor has conducted the following limited work on the Avon Plains Project:
• Engaged a local historical society to search archives for historic information.
• Located one historic shaft, which was observed during a recent site visit. The second shaft
(believed to have been approximately 150 m further North) has been filled in. Photos of the
headframe were visible in old farm photos taken prior to its demolition (Figure 4).
• Collected and assayed 366 soil samples.
• Drilled 16 vertical aircore holes.
The limited aircore drilling appears to have been ineffective in penetrating the mineralised reef at
Avon Plains, due to the hardness of the material and the groundwater issues, which is consistent with
historical information.

Surface Sampling
• 151 samples were taken in 2020 on a 100 m x 50 m to 100m x 100m grid to the west of the
historic shafts on EL007115 (Figure 5).
• A further 215 samples were taken along road reserves to the W, NW and SW of the historic
shafts, however likely contamination of these samples during lab analysis has rendered the
results unreliable, and they will need to be repeated by Bubalus.
• The best soil sample result was sample APS 012 with 47 ppb Au. This sample is located
approximately 90 m south of the historic shaft. Antimony was also anomalous up to 26 ppm.

Drilling
• 16 aircore holes were drilled on EL007115 by the Vendor in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 6). A
seventeenth hole was abandoned at 9 m and not sampled.
• 8 holes were drilled within 150 m of the existing historic mine shaft.
• 8 holes were drilled further to the east and south, within a 4 km radius.
• The best drilling result was at the end of APA 003 (1 m @ 0.135 ppm Au from 48 m, EOH).
Excessive water caused the hole to be abandoned. Chip tray cuttings from this interval were
observed during a recent field visit by Bubalus (Figure 7). The hole is located 30 m to the east
of the historic shaft and it is likely that this sample is from the top of the reef, based on
geological observations.
• The remaining drillholes have not intersected the reef, with other low level anomalous results
occurring mostly in holes located near the historic shafts.
• Two holes southeast of the historic shaft also had anomalous gold hits:
o APA 002 (5 m @ 0.064 ppm Au from 35 m), located 1.4 km SE of the historic shaft.
o APA 010 (1 m @ 0.069 ppm Au from 25 m), located 3.6 km SE of the historic shaft.

Next Steps
Based on historic articles and preliminary field observations, the mineralised reef is likely to have a
northeast trend, plunging 40 degrees to the north and dipping to the east.
The Company intends to implement a drilling program at Avon Plains, aimed at delineating the gold
bearing reef orientation, grade and extent, with a series of SE-NW lines (perpendicular to the NE
trend of the historic shaft and low quartz outcrop, visible in satellite imagery) with holes dipping toward
the NW to intercept the east dipping reef.
The Company will also implement a broad-based geochemical sampling program across the
remainder of the licence areas targeting new discoveries, and recorded gold occurrences.
More extensive soil sampling is intended to be undertaken, across the NE trending zones visible on
the satellite imagery, as well as further sampling across the broader licence area.
