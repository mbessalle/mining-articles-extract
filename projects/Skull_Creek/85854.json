    "description": "ASX Announcement ? PIONEER > LITHIUM 30 January 2025 id Pioneer Acquires Strategic Uranium Projects in the USA and Namibia Pioneer expanding its portfolio with the acquisition of two strategically significant uranium projects in Colorado, USA, and Namibia, Africa enhancing the Company's focus on critical energy minerals. Highlights . Expansion into Uranium Sector: Pioneer has entered into binding acquisition agreements for two significant uranium projects: o the Skull Creek Uranium Project in Colorado, USA, and the o Warmbad Uranium Project in Namibia. These acquisitions will broaden Pioneer's critical energy minerals portfolio with substantial exploration and development potential with tier 1 assets in uranium friendly jurisdictions. . Uranium Mining Friendly Jurisdictions: Both projects are located in uranium-friendly jurisdictions with well-established uranium industries. These regions provide supportive regulatory frameworks and access to critical infrastructure. . Skull Creek Uranium Project (USA): o Location: Colorado, hosting significant uranium mineralisation within the Sego Sandstone formation. o Historical Public Reports: Historical Reports on Skull Creek refer to a mineral resource that the Company cannot independently verify to JORC standards and therefore cannot disclose. The Company intends to diligently review this data to understand the scope and size of the mineralisation and to assist in future exploration programs. I< Strike length: The Skull Creek properties have a strike length of approximately 17 km o Infrastructure and Exploration: Well-supported by existing infrastructure with extensive exploration upside. Planning for field surveys and sampling activities are currently underway. . Warmbad Uranium Project (Namibia): o Coverage: Spans 271 km? within the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex, a globally significant uranium district. o Previous Exploration: 30,967 meters drilled including 161 RC holes (28,744 m) and 12 DD holes (2,223 m). ° Drill Ready Targets: Five areas of identified hard rock mineralisation with 63% of analysed samples returning grades between 100 — 400 ppm Uranium. o Untested paleochannels: Present significant exploration potential for secondary uranium deposits hosted in basal sediments or calcrete layers derived from uranium-rich granites Pioneer Lithium Ltd Level 50, 108 St Georges Terrace ASX: PLN T: +61 (8) 9465 1044 Perth, WA 6000 ABN 97 663 888 891 E: info@pioneerlithium.com.au Australia 1  > PIONEER (e LITHIUM cd o Geological Significance: Shares geological parallels with Namibia's renowned Rossing uranium deposit. . Pioneer’s Strategic Vision: Building a Global Critical Energy Minerals Powerhouse: Pioneer is pursuing critical energy and uranium projects worldwide. By targeting high-quality assets across key jurisdictions, Pioneer aims to establish itself as a leading force in the global critical energy minerals sector, driving the energy transition with a robust and diversified portfolio of critical energy minerals. . Equity Raising: Pioneer has received firm bids to raise A$1.675 million through an equity placement at $0.20 per share. Funds are to be used to review historical data and to advance exploration and development at the Skull Creek Uranium Project in Colorado, USA, and the Warmbad Uranium Project in Namibia, Africa. Field surveys, sampling, and other exploration activities are currently being prepared, reflecting Pioneer's commitment to unlocking the potential of these newly acquired assets. Board to participate A$320k in the Placement, subject to shareholder approval. Pioneer Lithium Limited (ASX Code: PLN) (‘Pioneer’ or 'the Company’) is pleased to announce the acquisition of two strategically significant uranium projects: the Skull Creek Uranium Project in Colorado, USA, and the Warmbad Uranium Project in Namibia, Africa. These acquisitions mark a pivotal step in Pioneer's strategy to diversify its portfolio into critical energy minerals. Both projects boast significant uranium potential, with substantial exploration upside identified through historical work. Commenting on the acquisitions, Pioneers Executive Chairman Robert Martin said: “These strategic acquisitions represent a defining moment for Pioneer, propelling us into the high-growth uranium sector with two world-class projects in uranium-friendly jurisdictions in the United States and Namibia. Both assets have had a plethora of work completed with ~31,000m of drilling at Warmbad with Skull Creek having a reported historical resource that unfortunately requires more detailed work to be able to report under the current JORC code. The Company intends to methodically work through these data sets and historical records to help define and delineate future work programs. As uranium takes centre stage in the shift to low-carbon energy solutions, these strategic additions enhance our portfolio that includes our Root Lake lithium prospects to create a pathway to substantial value creation in the critical minerals sector in 2025. We look forward to commencing an extensive review of historical data and commencing exploration activities across these exciting projects”. Skull Creek Uranium Project Overview The Skull Creek Uranium Project, located in north-western Colorado, USA, spans 114 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 15.5 square kilometres in Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties, Colorado (refer Appendix A). Twelve partial claims are present at Skull Creek in addition to the primary 114 claims, but the validity has yet to be determined. Situated on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the project is approximately 260 kilometres east of Salt Lake City, Utah. The project lies in a rural region with a long history of energy production and benefits from excellent infrastructure, including transportation and power. Nearby operations include the Deserado underground coal mine, which reportedly supplies coal to the 500 MW Bonanza Power Station, located 40 kilometres to the west, and the Rangely Oilfield, which has operated intermittently since the 1940s. The project hosts significant uranium mineralisation within the Sego Sandstone formation, with a focus along a 17-kilometre strike on the northern limb of the Red Wash Syncline. Historical exploration has identified uranium mineralisation within lignite seams and associated sandstones, particularly in the No. 2 lignite seam, which demonstrates the highest continuity among seven identified seams. The project includes a historical non-JORC inferred resource estimate which cannot be independently verified or disclosed by Pioneer at this stage. The Company will commence work on historical data immediately. 2",
