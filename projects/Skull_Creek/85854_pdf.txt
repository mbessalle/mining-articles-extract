Pioneer Lithium Limited (ASX Code: PLN) ('Pioneer' or 'the Company'), is pleased to announce the completion of its two strategically significant uranium projects: the Skull Creek Uranium Project in Colorado, USA, and the Warmbad Uranium Project in Namibia, Africa.

### Skull Creek Uranium Project Overview

The Skull Creek Uranium Project, located in north-western Colorado, USA and is situated on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the project is approximately 260 kilometres east of Salt Lake City, Utah.

The project lies in a rural region with a long history of energy production and benefits from excellent infrastructure, including transportation and power. Nearby operations include the Deserado underground coal mine, which reportedly supplies coal to the 500 MW Bonanza Power Station, located 40 kilometres to the west, and the Rangely Oilfield, which has operated intermittently since the 1940s.

The project has the potential to host significant uranium mineralisation within the Sego Sandstone formation, with a focus along a 17-kilometre strike on the northern limb of the Red Wash Syncline.

### Warmbad Uranium Project Overview

The Warmbad Uranium Project, located in southern Namibia, spans 271 km² under Exclusive Prospecting Licence (“EPL”) 8838. The project is situated within the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex (NMC), which hosts uranium mineralisation in alaskitic leucocratic zones within granites. It is strategically positioned near key infrastructure, including roads, water pipelines, and power lines, in a region renowned for its world-class uranium mines.

The project benefits from Namibia's supportive mining jurisdiction and well-established uranium industry. With its combination of surface occurrences, potential for both primary and secondary uranium deposits, and geological parallels to the Rossing uranium deposit, Warmbad represents a significant exploration potential for Pioneer.

The 4,250,000 consideration shares have been issued today, with details in relation to the same contained in the Appendix 2A lodged with the ASX today. The Consideration shares are subject to an escrow period of 12 months. Further details regarding the acquisitions can be found in the Company's announcement of 30 January 2025.
