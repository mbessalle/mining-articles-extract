    "description": "ASX Announcement ? PIONEER > 28 March 2025 id Pioneer Completes Strategic Uranium Project Acquisitions in USA and Namibia Pioneer expanding its portfolio with the acquisition of two strategically significant uranium projects in Colorado, USA, and Namibia, Africa enhancing the Company's focus on critical energy minerals. Pioneer Lithium Limited (ASX Code: PLN) (‘Pioneer or 'the Company’), is pleased to announce the completion of its two strategically significant uranium projects: the Skull Creek Uranium Project in Colorado, USA, and the Warmbad Uranium Project in Namibia, Africa. These acquisitions mark a pivotal step in Pioneer's strategy to diversify its portfolio into critical energy minerals. Skull Creek Uranium Project Overview The Skull Creek Uranium Project, located in north-western Colorado, USA and is situated on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the project is approximately 260 kilometres east of Salt Lake City, Utah. The project lies in a rural region with a long history of energy production and benefits from excellent infrastructure, including transportation and power. Nearby operations include the Deserado underground coal mine, which reportedly supplies coal to the 500 MW Bonanza Power Station, located 40 kilometres to the west, and the Rangely Oilfield, which has operated intermittently since the 1940s. The project has the potential to host significant uranium mineralisation within the Sego Sandstone formation, with a focus along a 17-kilometre strike on the northern limb of the Red Wash Syncline. 7 fi 4 Plas 7 OPE 4 sd _330km to Dever, Colorads -) 4mm 260km to Salt Lake Gity, Utah ing SP he xy = = A Ne -- p) Sy 1p p a CL e—— == = wt 44 Py TERR TE CER le AC > Desert Power Railway. = Pioneer Skull Creek Claims Re oo SHR Leases SOR 0 - n= phy: Redirects o Sandstone Formation 30km to Rangely & Rangely Airport Lt TOTO AS BUM climes et, ie [] Le— Sin 2 AES os : Figure 1: Overview of the Skull Creek Uranium Project showing Pioneers claims and states leases along the uranium bearing Sego Sandstone Formation, The project is proximal to major infrastructure including Highway 40 and the Deseret Power Railway Pioneer Lithium Ltd Level 50, 108 St Georges Terrace ASX: PLN T: +61 (8) 9465 1044 Perth, WA 6000 ABN 97 663 888 891 E: info@pioneerlithium.com.au Australia 1  > PIONEER LITHIUM The Warmbad Uranium Project, located in southern Namibia, spans 271 km? under Exclusive Prospecting Licence (“EPL”) 8838. The project is situated within the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex (NMC), which hosts uranium mineralisation in alaskitic leucocratic zones within granites. It is strategically positioned near key infrastructure, including roads, water pipelines, and power lines, in a region renowned for its world-class uranium mines. The project benefits from Namibia's supportive mining jurisdiction and well-established uranium industry. With its combination of surface occurrences, potential for both primary and secondary uranium deposits, and geological parallels to the Rossing uranium deposit, Warmbad represents a significant exploration potential for Pioneer. 20 nsf od a < =~ [i] ss BL STENTS. \\ NNT \\ Trak SRL AEN @ Warmbad Project Sr Airport @ Cities NAMIBIA ~~ Major Highways + TransNamib Railway ?
