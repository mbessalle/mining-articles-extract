ACCELERATE LAUNCHES NEW GOLD STRATEGY WITH 
ACQUISITION OF EXCITING PROJECT NEAR KALGOORLIE 
 
Key Points 
• Heads of Agreement executed with Metal Hawk Limited to acquire 70% interest in 
the Kanowna East Gold Project, strategically located just 25km from Kalgoorlie’s 
+60Moz Superpit and 9km east of the +6Moz Kanowna Belle gold mine in WA 
• Gold targets identified from re-interpretation of historic data include significant 
drill intercepts of 4m @ 17.7g/t Au, 8m @ 4.5g/t Au, 3m @ 7.1g/t Au, 18m @ 1.24g/t 
Au, 6m @ 3.4g/t Au and 5m @ 1.95g/t Au (details in body below) 
• Low-cost potential to utilise toll milling in future development supported by 
10 process plants operating within 75km radius of project  
• Additional 100% owned licence applied over 5km of highly prospective strike along 
the Scotia-Kanowna dome near Kanowna Belle gold mine 
• Gold strategy leverages team featuring former De Grey Mining Senior Geologist 
Mr. Luke Meter as CEO and former Regis Resources Exploration Manager Mr. Kevin 
Joyce 
 
Accelerate Resources Limited (“AX8”, “Accelerate” or the “Company”) is pleased to 
announce the launch of it’s new gold strategy with the acquisition of a 70% interest in the 
Kanowna East Gold Project, located in the prolific Kalgoorlie gold region of Western 
Australia. The project is strategically situated near major gold mines, including Kanowna 
Belle and the Kalgoorlie Superpit, and highlights a commitment to gold as a key commodity 
for the Company going forward. 
 
The project area was selected after rigorous evaluation and due diligence, with an emphasis 
on highly prospective but underexplored terrains, with the opportunity to transform 
discoveries into production faster and at lower cost. The Kanowna East Project stood out as 
it fulfills all the essential criteria and is close to multiple processing plants with toll milling 
services, enabling potential production from even modest deposits. 
 
Mr Luke Meter, Chief Executive Officer of Accelerate commented: “We are thrilled to 
launch our new gold strategy with the acquisition of a 70% interest in the Kanowna East 
Gold Project. This is a strategic move into the prime Kalgoorlie gold region which we 
consider highly prospective for gold discoveries, including further large Tier 1 scale deposits. 
Accelerate plans to actively drill the significant gold targets we have defined to date and 
expand our exploration in this area. With gold prices at record highs in Australia, it is time to 
play to the strengths of our team in this commodity and create value in the near term.”

About the Kanowna East Project 
The Kanowna East Project is situated 25 km northeast of Kalgoorlie and is prospective for 
gold and nickel. The project is located 9 km northeast of the +6 Moz Kanowna Belle gold 
mine.  
 
There is no outcrop in the project area which consists of aeolian sand and clays overlaying 
a major crustal lineament, the Mt Monger fault, bisecting a bedrock regime of ultramafic, 
mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and intrusive units.  
 
Historical exploration has primarily targeted nickel within a north-south trending ultramafic 
unit interpreted to host the Silver Swan / Black Swan nickel deposits located 12km to the 
north. Western Areas, now Independence Group (ASX:IGO) recently explored this unit 
under an expired earn in with Metal Hawk from 2020 and 2023, investing over $3M on drilling 
and geophysics. 
 
In 2020, Metal Hawk (ASX:MHK) followed up historic RAB drilling gold anomalies with 408 
shallow aircore drill holes, defining two new paleo-surface gold anomalies referred to as the 
Little Lake and Western Tiger Prospects (Figure 2 ). Significant assays from these prospects 
include (Figures 3 & 4): 
 
• 
5m @ 2.2g/t Au from 65m in drill hole KEAC006 
• 
6m @ 1.5g/t Au from 54m in drill hole KEAC051 
• 
3m @ 7.1g/t Au from 55m in drill hole KEAC180 
• 
6m @ 3.4g/t Au from 24m in drill hole KEAC186 
• 
5m @ 2.7g/t Au from 50m in drill hole KEAC264 
• 
5m @ 4.8g/t Au from 65m in drill hole KEAC265 
• 
6m @ 1.2g/t Au from 60m in drill hole KEAC275 
• 
8m @ 4.5g/t Au from 75m in drill hole KEAC373 
 
In the following year a 14-hole follow up RC drill program for 1,465m intercepted further 
significant paleo-surface gold.  
 
4m @ 17.7g/t Au from 75m (including 1m @ 42.7g/t Au from 76m) was intercepted in drill 
hole KERC012 (Figure 3) as well as a modest but important basement intercept 200m NE 
along strike of 5m @ 0.52g/t Au from 100m in drill hole KERC010. 
 
Focus moved away from the Kanowna East project shortly after the completion of the 
successful RC program due to Metal Hawk’s Berehaven nickel sulphide discovery and more 
recently their high-grade gold discovery south of Leinster.

Geology Model 
Accelerate considers the previous results at Kanowna East to be highly anomalous with 
significant potential for under cover paleo-surface and basement gold mineralised systems. 
 
Accelerates’ technical team interprets the high-grade and broad gold intercepts at both Little 
Lake and Western Tiger as indicators of proximity to a basement gold source. The company 
plans to test an exploration model akin to the +3 million ounce Garden Well Deposit. The 
Garden Well deposit is an Archean orogenic gold deposit, initially covered by a gold-bearing 
paleochannel and overlain by 35 meters of sediments, before the discovery of a high-grade 
gold shoot in basement under the southern end of the paleochannel (Figure 5). 
 
Figure 5: Vertically exaggerated schematic cross-section displaying potential basement hosted 
mineralisation source below a gold bearing paleochannel. Modified from Anand, Ravi R et al 2021. 
 
Exploration Activities Program 
 
As native title agreements and heritage surveys are finalised, Accelerate will begin detailed 
geological mapping within tenements E27/700 and E27/704, focusing on uncovered areas. 
The Company will also assess the potential of employing geophysical surveys to identify 
potential structures associated with the Little Lake and Western Tiger mineralisation. The 
identified structures will subsequently be evaluated and ranked for potential inclusion in the 
planned drill program. The focus will be on understanding the geological structures and the 
relationship between paleo-surface anomalies and underlying basement mineralised 
systems. This phase may also include geochemical techniques to refine target areas for 
drilling commencement in early Q2 2025.

Drilling will target both paleo-surface gold deposits and undercover basement systems, with 
the goal of defining a resource estimate. The exploration model will be guided by the 
successful approach used at the Garden Well Deposit. Data from drilling will be analysed to 
assess the potential for economically viable gold deposits, paving the way for future 
development and production.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard measurement 
tools appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down hole gamma 
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). 
These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure 
sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or 
systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation 
that are Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has 
been done this would be relatively simple (eg 
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 
1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised 
to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In 
other cases more explanation may be 
required, such as where there is coarse gold 
that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg 
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information. 
• 
AC drilling was sampled via scoop near the drill 
rig using a combination of composite sampling 
(2m – 6m) and single 1m sampling at end of 
hole – 400g to 1,000g. 
• 
Reverse Circulation (RC) drill holes were 
routinely sampled at 1m intervals down the hole. 
• 
RC Samples were collected at the drill rig using 
a rig-mounted cone splitter to collect a nominal 2 
- 3 kg sub sample. 
• 
All samples were submitted to Intertek Genalysis 
Laboratory in Kalgoorlie for preparation where 
each sample was crushed, dried, and pulverised 
to produce a sub-sample. 
• 
The pulps were then sent to Perth for analysis 
via 50g Fire Assay with ICP-OES (Intertek code 
FA50/OE04) with a 5ppb lower detection limit. 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-
hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple 
or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is 
oriented and if so, by what method, etc). 
• 
AC drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples that 
were passed through a cyclone and collected in 
a bucket which was emptied on the ground. 
• 
RC Samples were collected at the drill rig using 
a rig-mounted cone splitter to collect a nominal 2 
- 3 kg sub sample. 
• 
A face sampling down holebid was used at all 
times. 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and 
chip sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery 
and ensure representative nature of the 
samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to preferential 
loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
• 
A qualitative estimate of sample recovery was 
done for each sample metre collected from the 
drill rig. 
• 
A qualitative estimate of sample weight was 
done to ensure consistency of sample size and 
to monitor sample recoveries. 
• 
Samples were variably dry, damp and 
sometimes wet. Sample condition was logged 
• 
Drill sample recovery and quality is considered 
to be adequate for the drilling technique 
employed. 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
level of detail to support appropriate Mineral 
Resource estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in 
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) 
photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged. 
• 
All drill sample intervals were geologically 
logged by qualified Geologists. 
• 
Where appropriate, geological logging recorded 
the abundance of specific minerals, rock types 
and weathering using a standardised logging 
system. 
• 
A small sample of drill material was retained in 
chip trays for future reference and validation of 
geological logging. 
• 
Photographs were taken of all sample spoils 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, 
rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or 
dry. 
• 
For all sample types, the nature, quality and 
appropriateness of the sample preparation 
technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples. 
• 
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is 
representative of the in situ material collected, 
including for instance results for field 
• 
AC samples were collected using a cyclone 
attached to the drill rig. The sample material was 
emptied on the ground and a 400g-1000g sub-
sample was taken from each one-metre interval 
using a sampling scoop. Sub-samples for 
consecutive metres within composite intervals 
were placed in a pre-numbered calico bag. 
• 
Field QC involves the review of laboratory 
supplied certified reference material, in house 
controls, blanks, splits and duplicates. These 
QC results are reported by the laboratory with 
final assay results.

duplicate/second-half sampling. 
• 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the 
grain size of the material being sampled. 
• 
No AC field duplicates were taken. 
• 
All samples were analysed at a Perth laboratory 
Intertek Genalysis using Fire-Assay method 
FA50/OE04 
• 
Sample preparation included sorting, drying and 
pulverizing (85% passing 75μm) in a LM5 steel 
mill. 
• 
The AC sample sizes are considered more than 
adequate to ensure that there are no particle 
size effects. 
• 
All RC 1m samples were cone split at the drill 
rig. 
• 
Routine field sample duplicates were taken to 
evaluate whether samples were representative. 
• 
Additional sample preparation was undertaken 
by Intertek laboratory. 
• 
At the laboratory, samples were weighed, dried 
and crushed to -2mm in a jaw crusher. The 
crushed sample was subsequently bulk-
pulverised in a ring mill to achieve a nominal 
particle size of 85% passing 75um. 
• 
RC Sample sizes and laboratory preparation 
techniques are considered to be appropriate for 
this early stage exploration and the commodity 
being targeted. 
 
Quality of 
assay data 
and laboratory 
tests 
• 
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the 
assaying and laboratory procedures used and

parameters used in determining the analysis 
including instrument make and model, reading 
times, calibrations factors applied and their 
derivation, etc. 
• 
Nature of quality control procedures adopted 
(eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable 
levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and 
precision have been established. 
• 
Analysis for gold and other elements was 
undertaken using Intertek method FA50/OE04 to 
0.005ppm detection limit. 
• 
No geophysical tools or other non-assay 
instrument types were used in the analyses 
reported. 
• 
Review of routine standard reference material 
and sample blanks suggest there are no 
significant analytical bias or preparation errors in 
the reported analyses. 
• 
Results of analyses for field sample duplicates 
are consistent with the style of mineralisation 
being evaluated and considered to be 
representative of the geological zones which 
were sampled. 
• 
Internal laboratory QAQC checks are reported 
by the laboratory. 
• 
Review of the internal laboratory QAQC 
suggests the laboratory is performing within 
acceptable limits.

intervals down the hole. 
• 
Locational accuracy at collar and down the drill 
hole is considered appropriate for this early 
stage of exploration. 
Data spacing 
and 
distribution 
• 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
Whether the data spacing and distribution is 
sufficient to establish the degree of geological 
and grade continuity appropriate for the 
Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation 
procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
• 
Whether sample compositing has been 
applied. 
• 
The drillhole spacing along lines are mostly 
approximately 80m apart. The section spacings 
are a minimum of 200m. 
• 
Data from AC and RC drilling is not suitable for 
estimation of Mineral Resources. 
• 
AC sample compositing occurred over 2m to 6m 
intervals. 
• 
RC sample compositing was not applied to the 
reported intervals. 
Orientation of 
data in 
relation to 
geological 
structure 
• 
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves 
unbiased sampling of possible structures and 
the extent to which this is known, considering 
the deposit type. 
• 
If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to have 
introduced a sampling bias, this should be 
assessed and reported if material. 
• 
The orientation of mineralized structures is 
unknown. 
• 
No sampling bias is believed to have been 
introduced.

Drill hole 
Information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following 
information for all Material drill holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill hole 
collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in metres) of 
the drill hole collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down hole length and interception depth 
o 
hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is justified 
on the basis that the information is not 
Material and this exclusion does not detract 
from the understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain 
why this is the case. 
• 
Reported significant historic results are 
summarised in Appendix 1 and 2 within the 
attached announcement. 
• 
Grid co-ordinates are MGA94 zone 50 
• 
Collar elevation is defined as height above sea 
level in metres (RL) 
• 
Dip is the inclination of the hole from the 
horizontal. Azimuth is reported in MGA94 zone 50 
degrees as the direction toward which the hole is 
drilled. 
• 
Drill Depth of the hole is the distance from the 
surface to the end of the hole, as measured along 
the drill trace 
• 
From (m) and To (m) is the distance down the hole 
as measured along the drill trace.

aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of 
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation should 
be stated and some typical examples of 
such aggregations should be shown in 
detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
• 
Drill hole intersections are reported from 
composite and 1m metre down hole samples. 
Intersection grade is reported as length-weighted 
average grade. 
• 
A nominal cut-off of 0.01 g/t Au was applied with 
up to 4m of internal dilution. 
• 
No Top Cuts were applied. 
• 
No metal equivalent reporting is used or applied. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole 
length, true width not known’). 
• 
No definite relationships between mineralisation 
widths and intercept lengths are known from this 
drilling due to the highly weathered nature of the 
material sampled. 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Refer to figures in main text 
 
 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high 
grades and/or widths should be practiced to 
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
All significant intercepts and summary of drill hole 
assay information are presented in Appendix 1 and 
2 1. of this announcement. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but 
not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test 
results; bulk density, groundwater, 
geotechnical and rock characteristics; 
potential deleterious or contaminating 
substances. 
• 
There is no other exploration data which is 
considered material to the results reported in this 
announcement.
