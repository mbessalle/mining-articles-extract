Granting of the mining leases is an important part of the permitting process for Springdale. Flora and fauna
assessment and mapping has been completed with surveys confirming the project area is already cleared
for agriculture and proposed mining activities would have little impact on natural vegetation or wildlife.
A LiDAR drone survey was completed in quarter three this year and will will be used to assist hydrology
assessment including drilling planned for early 2025.
