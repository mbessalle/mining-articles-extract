Bulletin Resources Limited (“Bulletin”, “BNR”) is pleased to advise that it has entered into a Sale and Purchase 
Agreement (“SPA”) to acquire 100% ownership of 509km2 of gold prospective exploration tenements adjacent to 
its Lake Rebecca Gold Project, 150km east north-east of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The tenements are near 
the Northern Star Resources Ltd (ASX:NST) 4.0 Moz Au Carosue Dam Operations and Ramelius Resources Limited 
(ASX:RMS, Ramelius) 1.4 Moz Au Rebecca gold project and 1.8 Moz Au Roe gold project (Figure 1).

Geology 
Totaling 509km2 in area, the acquisition comprises seven granted exploration tenements. The tenements are 
adjacent to Bulletin’s existing 600km2 Lake Rebecca Gold Project and grows the Project to 1,100km2.  The primary 
exploration target is large, low to moderate grade gold deposits, similar to the deposits within  Ramelius’ 1.4 Moz 
Au Rebecca gold project and 1.8 Moz Au Roe gold project. 
The new tenement package is located on the eastern margin of the Norsemen-Wiluna Greenstone Belt in the 
southern portion of the Laverton Tectonic Zone (LTZ). The greenstone belt consists of mafic to ultramafic volcanic 
rocks, felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks and siliciclastic sedimentary units. Metamorphic grades generally 
increase from greenschist facies in the west to amphibolite facies in the east. In the eastern part of the project 
area along the edge of the greenstone belt, the rocks are strongly deformed and predominantly comprise 
interleaved granite and mafic gneiss. 
The new tenement package has three established north-northwest oriented gold mineralised trends.  
The western trend is associated with drill defined gold-arsenic prospects that straddle branches of the Keith-
Kilkenny shear zone and includes the Graham’s Find, Graham’s Find South, Graham’s Find East, Mulgabbie South 
and Old Homestead targets. These targets are southeast and along strike of Northern Star Resources Ltd’s (ASX: 
NST) Carosue Dam operations and OzAurum Resources Ltd’s (ASX:OZM) recent high grade drill results including 
20m at 3.57g/t Au at Mulgabbie North (Figure 1) (refer OZM ASX announcement dated 3 February 2025). 
The central trend is associated with drill defined gold prospects that straddle the Laverton/Pinjin and Celia Fault 
system and includes the Goats Dam, Bosses Dam and Yindi SE targets.  
The eastern trend extends into the Rebecca gold system and comprises the structural corridor hosting gold 
mineralisation such as Ramelius’ 1.4Moz Au Rebecca Project, the 76.4Koz Au Kirgella Gift deposit and nearby 
recent drilling of Kalgoorlie Gold Mining Ltd (ASX:KAL) with results including 17 m at 4.81 g/t Au (Figure 1) (refer 
KAL ASX announcement dated 17 February 2025).  
Transaction Details 
The tenements subject to the SPA are currently held in a Joint Venture Agreement (JV) between St Barbara Limited 
(ASX:SBM) and Plowden Resources Pty Ltd (Plowden). Under the Agreement, Plowden is entitled to spend up to 
$15.6M to earn a 70% interest (refer SBM ASX release dated 25 January 2022). 
The SPA has been executed by the parties with completion of the transaction expected shortly. 
Under the SPA, the total consideration for 100% beneficial ownership of the tenements from JV partners St 
Barbara Limited and Plowden (the Sellers) is up to $140,768 plus a maximum 2% net smelter return royalty.  
Details of the consideration are: 
(a) 
$70,000 (plus GST) paid upon completion of the transaction; and 
(b) 
$30,000 (plus GST) paid in the event that, within 60 days of execution of sale and purchase agreement, 
Bulletin is satisfied that all outstanding rehabilitation activities currently required to be completed in 
respect of the Tenements have been completed by the Sellers, 
 
 
 
 
In addition, Bulletin will reimburse the Sellers for the rent prepaid on each of tenements E28/2313 and E28/2234 
for the forthcoming tenement year in the amount of $40,768.   
Bulletin will grant the Sellers a net smelter return royalty not to exceed a rate of 2% in respect of the sale of 
minerals extracted from the area of the tenements, capped to a maximum payment of A$1,000,000 with 
payments to start 24 months after the commencement of productive mining. The maximum rate of the royalty 
payable in respect of a tenement will be reduced to the extent of any existing obligation to pay a royalty to a third 
party.
