ASX ANNOUNCEMENT 
28 October 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
Tenement Granted at Earaheedy  
and Ned’s Creek Update 
 
HIGHLIGHTS 
• E69/3532 Granted at Earaheedy 
 
• Soil sampling started on E69/3532 in the areas with identified volcanic 
rocks 
 
• RC drilling at the Ned’s Creek Gold Project returned no significant 
results. 
 
Lodestar Managing Director Ed Turner commented: “We are happy that E69/3532 has finally 
be granted after a 7 year wait. This tenement includes some of the most prospective areas 
within our Earaheedy Project for base metal and gold mineralisation. We have immediately 
commenced first pass soil sampling over the north west part of the tenement where geological 
mapping by Lodestar has identified large areas of mafic and ultramafic rocks which have not 
previously been identified within the Proterozoic sedimentary package. 
 
The RC drilling at Ned’s Creek unfortunately did not return significant gold mineralisation 
despite intersecting extensive quartz veining and strong alteration and shearing in one of the 
scissor holes.” 
 
Lodestar Minerals Limited (Lodestar or the Company) (ASX:LSR) is pleased to report the grant 
of E69/3532 (Figure 1) on 16th October 2024 after a State Deed was signed by the Mungarlu 
Ngurrarankatja Rirraunkaja Aboriginal Corporation, Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal 
Corporation and the State of Western Australia following a seven (7) years wait. 
 
Earaheedy Project 
Tenement E69/3532 cover a large part of the prospective area of the Earaheedy Project. 
Geological mapping was completed over the last 2 years by Lodestar geological team over the 
area and large areas of mafic and ultramafic rocks were identified. The presence of volcanics 
rocks linked to large scale crustal faults drives the area to as a prospective zone for base metal 
and gold mineralisation. 
A soil sampling program of 560 samples is planned to cover prospective areas in the NW of 
the tenement.

Ned’s Creek Project 
At Ned’s Creek, the results of the composite samples of phase 2 drilling comprising two 
additional RC holes (LNRC003 & LNRC004) (Table 1, Figure 2) for a total of 444m were received 
and presented no significant Au intersections.

Figure 2: RC drill hole locations testing the two magnetic targets at Ned’s Creek in relation to historical 
drilling displaying their max Au in ppm. 
 
The last two phases of drilling included four RC holes (Figure 2) which were targeting two 
previously undrilled magnetic targets. LNRC004 did not intersect any Proterozoic sediments 
and was very different to LNRC002. It intersected dominant intervals of quartz veins and 
veinlets extending over 80m downhole as well as a highly deformed and silicified diorite unit. 
Mafic basalt also intersected was sheared and silicified. The units, veining and alteration 
intersected matched the geological target model, but no significant Au mineralisation was 
intersected. The geological interpretation will be reviewed to determine if quartz veining is 
part of the main mineralisation corridor or could be a later stage cross cutting fault.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data  
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals 
under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF 
instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and 
the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this 
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to 
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, 
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. 
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may 
warrant disclosure of detailed information. 
• RC drill holes were sampled on 4m composites intervals throughout (last 
composite is between 1 - 4 m). Samples were collected from the cyclone 
every 1m and were laid in sequence on the ground in rows of 20. 
• Sample representivity is maintained by placing the samples in a pre-
numbered calico bag with a corresponding sample number on an excel 
spreadsheet and for drill samples maintaining dry sampling and good 
drilling practice, avoiding sample over runs and contamination. Certified 
reference materials, and laboratory repeat samples are analysed routinely. 
• RC 4m-Composite samples were collected using an aluminum scoop and 
combined to create a 2.5 to 3.0kg composite sample.  
• The samples were submitted to Intertek Laboratory Perth, for drying, 
crushing, and pulverising to produce a 50g charge for fire assay of gold. 
Drilling techniques 
• 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, 
auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard 
tube, depth of diamond tails, face- sampling bit or other type, whether core is 
oriented and if so, by what method, etc). 
• 
RC drilling used an 4 ½ inch hammer. 
• 
RC holes were collar surveyed with a compass and GPS 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and 
results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative 
nature of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and 
whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of 
fine/coarse material. 
• 
Sample recoveries and wet samples were monitored and recorded 
qualitatively in Lodestar’s drill hole database. Recoveries were generally 
80 -100%.  
• High pressure air used to maintain a dry sample and drill sampling 
equipment was cleaned regularly to minimise contamination. 
• There is no apparent relationship between sample recovery and grade. 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically 
logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 
• 
Logging is qualitative in nature. 
• 
All RC holes are geologically logged every meter supporting a level of 
mineral exploration and potential future Mineral Resource estimation. 
• 
A small sample of every meter is stored in a chip tray and photographed. 
All the chip trays are stored at Lodestar sheds either on site or in Perth.

from a splitter on the cyclone. 
• 
All RC samples are stored in pre-numbered calico bags and submitted to 
Intertek, Perth, for sample preparation and analysis. 
• 
Sample preparation for drill samples involves drying the whole sample, 
crushing to 3mm and pulverising to 90% passing -75 microns. The 
pulverised sample is split with a rotary sample divider to obtain a 50 gram 
charge.

are reported. 
Orientation of data 
in relation to 
geological 
structure 
• 
Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of 
possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the 
deposit type. 
• 
If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this 
should be assessed and reported if material. 
• 
At Ned’s Creek, the main geological stratigraphy is steeply dipping to the 
NNE with some variation within the geological sequence. 
• 
At Ned’s Creek, this current drilling is expected to be following the 
stratigraphy but not enough information is known yet to extrapolate the 
thickness of the intercepts.

Mineral tenement 
and land tenure 
status 
• 
Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements 
or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, 
overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national 
park and environmental settings. 
• 
The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known 
impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. 
• The drilling at Ned’s Creek was on E52/2456 which is 100% owned by 
Lodestar (through Audacious Resources Pty Ltd, Lodestar’s wholly owned 
subsidiary company). 
Exploration done by 
other parties 
• 
Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. 
 
• 
Exploration commenced at McDonald Well in the late 1960’s. WMC 
explored for Zambian Copper Belt style mineralisation and completed 
regional geological mapping and sampling, followed by minor percussion 
drilling. CRA Exploration completed regional mapping and auger sampling, 
also at McDonald Well. No significant anomalies were identified on the 
tenements. Minor exploration drilling by Barrick and CRA Exploration east 
and south of Contessa intersected ultramafic lithologies, confirming the 
extent of the greenstone sequence in this area. There has been no 
material exploration by other parties over the Contessa area before 
Lodestar minerals. 
 
Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. 
• 
The geology of the project area comprises the northern margin of the 
Proterozoic Yerrida Basin. The geology forms two discrete units; 
Proterozoic sediments of the Yerrida Basin that are prospective for 
sediment-hosted copper and base metal mineralisation in black shale and 
carbonate sequences, with evidence of secondary and primary copper 
mineralisation in the Thaduna district, overlie Archaean basement rocks 
on the northern margin of the Yerrida Basin. The basement-sediment 
contact trends east- west and Lodestar’s exploration has identified 
extensive gold anomalism adjacent to this contact. The basement consists 
of granite and fringing mafic to intermediate and ultramafic rocks that 
have minimal outcrop. The mafic-ultramafic rocks and the adjacent granite 
that hosts gold mineralisation are thought to be Archaean in age. 
Identification of syenite-hosted, intrusion-related gold mineralisation at 
Brumby and Gidgee Flat indicates that this region differs from other lode 
gold occurrences in the Plutonic Well greenstone belt and the surrounding 
Proterozoic fold belt and does not form part of the adjacent Marymia 
Inlier.

Drill hole 
information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration 
results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill 
holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of 
the drill hole collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down hole length and interception depth  
o 
hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is 
not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the 
report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. 
• 
See table in the main text.   
Data aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum 
and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off 
grades are usually Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and 
longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be 
shown in detail.  The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent 
values should be clearly stated. 
• 
There were no results > 0.1g/t Au.  
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
o 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole 
angle is known, its nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
These two holes were drilled to target the magnetic anomalies and were 
drilled to intersect the anomalies at an interpreted perpendicular angle. 
At both locations the host rocks do not outcrop and therefore the dip and 
strike cannot be confirmed at this time. This is the first drill testing of these 
targets and therefore the true width of mineralisation is unknown. 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should 
be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but 
not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate

sectional views. 
Balanced reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
There were no assays greater than 0.1g/t Au. 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including 
(but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; 
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; 
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. 
• 
All information has been reported within the text of the announcement, 
no other information to report. 
Further Work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or 
depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is 
not commercially sensitive. 
• 
Follow up RC drilling will be completed including scissor holes to test for 
different mineralisation orientations.
