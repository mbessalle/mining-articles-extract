historic mine workings from which approximately 118,000 ounces of gold at a grade of 19.1 g/t Au
were reportedly produced1. Archival records further suggest that production was from a southward- High
plunging ore shoot, and that this remains open along strike, to depth and with potential for structural Beta
repeats. This occurrence has never been explored by modern means and as such presents a Year High
significant, high-grade exploration opportunity.
Market Cap
In addition to its past production, Queen's Birthday was home, at the time, to the world's largest gold PB Ratio
nugget - the "Welcome Stranger" - found on the Property in 1869. Reportedly weighing 11 stone EPS

Project Name
Queen's Birthday Project
Until recently the area of Queen's Birthday was controlled by GBM Gold Ltd. under now-expired
tenure. Other than a limited program of rock-chip sampling, no on-ground exploration was completed
by GBM. Other past operators of the Property include Bendigo Mining Ltd. during the mid 1990's,
Ando Resources NL, WMC, CRA Exploration (Rio Tinto), BHP and Highlake Resources NL in the
1980's, and North Broken Hill Ltd. in the 1970's. There has been no drilling work within the area of
the Property since the mid 1980's and no holes appear to have targeted the historic workings.
Work by Leviathan to obtain, compile and interpret historical exploration reports for the Property is
ongoing and will be reported on in the near future. Queen's Birthday adjoins the Company's existing
Racecourse Reef Exploration License – EL 7295 - and lies on the Goldsborough – Wehla Shear Zone
(Figure 1).
Leviathan Gold Chief Executive Officer, Luke Norman, remarked: "Securing tenure to Queen's
Birthday is a significant development for Leviathan in terms of upgrading its exploration pipeline in
Victoria. This new Exploration License provides the Company with ready, open, and accessible drill
targets immediately beneath, and along strike from historic high-grade workings that have seen in

Queen's Birthday lies within the Bendigo-Ballarat zone of the Palaeozoic Lachlan Fold Belt of
eastern Australia. This major fold belt has an orogenic history stretching from the Cambrian to the
Carboniferous recording arc-continent collision, marine and non-marine sedimentation, folding and
faulting, volcanism, igneous intrusion and regional metamorphism.
Lower Ordovician marine sediments and metasediments comprise the main part of the Palaeozoic
bedrock at the Property. These sediments belong to a sequence of turbiditic sandstones, siltstones
and mudstones known as the Castlemaine Supergroup. The provenance of the turbidites is
considered to be continental in origin, consisting of a mixture of quartz, mica, rutile, tourmaline and
lithic fragments. Due to the lack of distinctive lithological units-regional subdivision of the Ordovician
is based on unique graptolite assemblages. The total thickness of the Castlemaine Supergroup is
estimated to be in excess of 5 kilometers.
In the Late Ordovician to Late Devonian the Bendigo-Ballarat zone underwent a period of crustal
shortening (regional compression) resulting in extensive folding and reverse faulting which have
significantly increased the apparent thickness of the Castlemaine Supergroup.
The Tarnagulla Granite, a post-tectonic Upper Devonian granitoid to the north east and the Mt
Moliagul granite to the south of the Property intruded the Ordovician sediments, similar intrusions are
located elsewhere in the Bendigo Zone. In the Mesozoic (Jurassic) lamprophyre dykes intruded into
the Ordovician sediments, and evidence of at least one diatreme eruption has been preserved within
the region.
The Property is situated in the footwall of the Avoca Fault on the western margin of the Lachlan
Fold Belt. The geology consists of a steeply dipping, folded Lower Ordovician turbidite sequence of
slates, siltstones and sandstones which have been metamorphosed into phyllites,
andalusite/cordierite mica schists, spotted slates, quartzites and adjacent to granite contacts
hornfels. Locally these metasediments have been intruded by the Moliagul and Tarnagulla

orientation. Gold quartz vein and gold "indicator bed" mineralization are found in three distinct belts
within the area – The Moliagul-Birthday Lineament, the Inkerman Lineament and the Harvest Home
Trend. The Harvest Home Trend lies to the east of the Property.
Shear Zones are developed throughout the area, and are characterised by the presence of faults,
fractures, quartz reefs, massive ironstones, breccias and shear fabrics. Regional shear zones are
identified where these structures are traced along strike for a number of kilometres as in the
Goldsborough – Wehla Shear Zone.
Geological Controls
The Queen's Birthday group of mines is located within the so-called Goldsborough–Wehla Shear,
this is considered to be a major deep penetrating structure which has provided a migration pathway
for large quantities of both gold and quartz. This mineralised corridor stretches some 25 kilometers
from Goldsborough in the south to Wehla in the north. The corridor is renowned for its exceptional
yield of nuggets, the Welcome Stranger being the most famous.
While the structural lineation is extensive, at Goldsborough at least two cross-structures have
dislocated the reef line over the ~600 metres of productive strike and have altered the strike by ~15
degrees. This appears to have created a favourable structural setting, left step flexure. A similar
situation occurs at Harvest Home where there is a distinct change in direction of mineralization, of
about 15 degrees, between the Mother O Gold and Harvest Home mine sites. Elsewhere in the
Bendigo Zone, most notably at Bendigo, left step flexure of the reef lines is a very favourable
indicator of mineralization and careful mapping of the Moliagul-Birthday Lineament, the Inkerman
Lineament within the Property may indicate other such zones.
The Moliagul-Birthday Lineament extends through the Property to the Moliagul area, and it is
paralleled by similar structures, the Inkerman lineament and the Harvest Home trend.
