The Robe River JV Proposal states that the Robe River JV: 
1. wishes to obtain the support of significant CZR shareholders for the transaction; 
2. has sufficient available cash to fund the Robe River JV Proposal; and 
3. is willing to consider providing an equivalent amount of debt funding to that which is available to CZR 
under the working capital loan provided by Fenix plus an amount equal to the break fee under the Bid 
Implementation Agreement  between Fenix Resources Ltd (Fenix) and CZR dated 25 February 2025 
(BIA). 
Robe River JV has stated that the Robe River JV Proposal is incomplete, is not an offer capable of acceptance, 
remains subject to the conditions outlined above and the Robe River JV are not under any obligation to proceed 
with the proposed transaction (and no assurance or representation is made that the transaction documentation 
will be entered into on the proposed terms or otherwise).  
As announced on 25 February 2025 and 20 March 2025, the BIA with Fenix includes standard exclusivity 
arrangements (including no talk, no due diligence restrictions and notification and matching rights) together with 
a break fee regime of $650,000 in favour of Fenix. The no talk, no due diligence and notification exclusivity 
arrangements are subject to customary fiduciary exceptions that enable the directors of CZR to comply with 
their fiduciary and statutory duties. CZR has provided notice to Fenix of the Robe River JV Proposal. 
Based on the information contained in the Robe River JV Proposal, the CZR Board has determined in good 
faith after consultation with its external legal advisors that the Robe River JV Proposal is a Potential Competing 
Proposal (as defined in the BIA) that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined 
in the BIA) if it were to be proposed. Accordingly, the CZR Board has determined that the fiduciary exception 
applies and CZR intends to engage with Robe River JV in relation to the Robe River JV Proposal.  
CZR notes that the Robe River JV Proposal is a non-binding and conditional proposal which remains subject to 
the conditions described above. CZR will continue to keep the market informed if there are any further material 
developments in relation to the Robe River JV Proposal.  
CZR Board continues to recommend the Fenix Offer 
While CZR engages with the Robe River JV in relation to the Robe River JV Proposal, CZR directors continue 
to unanimously recommend that all CZR shareholders ACCEPT Fenixâ€™s Offer, in the absence of a Superior 
Proposal. CZR directors holding CZR shares have accepted Fenix's Offer.  
This announcement has been approved and authorised for release by the Board of CZR.
