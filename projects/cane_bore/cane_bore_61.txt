A SX Announcement
30 September 2024
Exploration License granted over Cane Bore Iron Project
Highlights
Cane Bore Iron Project, WA – 100% Interest
• Exploration License (E08/3424) granted over the Cane Bore Iron Ore Project within the
Hamersly Province of the Pilbara, Western Australia ~ 100 km by sealed road from Port of
Onslow.
• More than 30km of remnant Channel Iron Deposits (CID) identified with historic rock
sampling indicates grades of 51.3% to 55.0% Fe.
• The CID averages 400m widths and sits up to 20m above the surrounding surface.
• Burley is readying for a mapping and rock-chip sampling programme and is preparing a
Programme of Work for its maiden drilling programme.
• Burley is currently engaging with Traditional Owners to complete heritage surveys for the
maiden drill programme.
Burley Minerals Limited (ASX: BUR, “Burley” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that
Exploration License E08/3424 (the Cane Bore Iron Project) was granted by The Department of
Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS). Cane Bore is located within the world
class Pilbara Province of the Western Australia and located less than 100 km by sealed road from
the export Port of Onslow.
The grant of E08/3424 is subject to the conditions outlined in the Conservation Management Plan
(CMP) approved by Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) earlier this
year. The CMP provides details of the proposed exploration programmes at Cane Bore and the
measures that will be implemented to mitigate environmental impacts of exploration activities.
Burley has Heritage Protection Agreements in place with the PKKP Aborginal Coporation and
Buurabalayji Thalanjyi Aborginal Coporation, and is pursuing heritage surveys now. Furthermore,
the Programme of Work (PoW) application for the maiden drilling programme is being prepared.
This maiden drilling program is well defined in the CMP, faciliatiing the PoW application process. In
addition, Burely is preparing a preliminary mapping and rock chip sampling exercise over the
Channel Iron Deposit (CID) target areas at Cane Bore.
The Cane Bore Iron Project is adjacent to the sealed Northwest Coastal Highway, interesecting the
Osnslow Road, and approximately 200 km southwest of Burley’s Broad Flat Well Iron Project (see
Figure 1). The Cane River area was historically explored for iron resources in the late 1960s, but only
wide-spaced sampling of surface materials was reported. More recent reconnisaince work, using
recent satellite imagery, multi-spectral imagery, topographic data and extrapolation of known
regional resources, indicates the potential to delineate more than 30 linear km of CID
mineralisation at Cane Bore.

Burley Minerals Managing Director and CEO, Stewart McCallion commented:
“We are very pleased to have the Cane Bore exploration license granted. This is a major milestone
for Burley as Cane Bore has the potential for significant CID-style iron resources, rivalling its
neighbours in the local region. Our geologists are getting ready to mobilise to site and complete
mapping and surface sampling over 30km of remnant Channel Iron Deposits (CID) that sits up to
20m above the surrounding terraine.
We are liasing with the Traditional Owners of the land to arrange heritage surveys over the primary
drilling targets. The approved Conservation Management Plan detailed the proposed exploration
programme at Cane Bore and this forms the basis to lodge a PoW application to DEMIRS now;
there is more than 200 hectares of CID target areas to explore in this first pass. We are very excited
about commencing a maiden drill programme over this substantial project and thank Burley
shareholders for their patience while we reached this significant milestone.”

Cane Bore Iron Project, Historical Sampling
Records of historic rock chip sampling by United States Steel International (New York) Incorporated
(US Steel) from two field reconnaissance trips conducted in 1968 and 1969 at the Cane Bore area
have revealed grades in upwards of 55% Fe; some 18 rock chip samples were collected over the
3

extent of the exploration license, returning assay results between 45% and 54.3% Fe. The historical
rock chip sample locations are illustrated in Figure . The US Steel rock chip sample records were
previsously reported1.

Cane Bore Background
The exploration license application area is along the western margin of the Hamersley Basin, with
the geology dominated by mid-to late Miocene channel iron deposits, which occur as a
meandering line of dissected outcrop adjacent to the Cane River. The deposits are flanked by
Quaternary alluvial and colluvial deposits related to the Cane River and its tributaries. Outcrop to
the north and south of the Quaternary cover sequences, are low-grade greenschist facies
sediments (mudstones to conglomerates), felsic to mafic volcanic rock, BIF, and dolostone of the
Proterozoic Ashburton Formation. The far western corner of the application is underlain by the

and mudstone.
Photo 1: Cane Bore Central B location looking northeast along the CID structure suggest that the
mesa-forms rise to 20m from the surrounding, flat-lying ground.
The upper areas of this palaeodrainage system (i.e. outside of E08/3424) were drill assessed by API
Management Pty Ltd. In 2016, Red Hill Iron Ltd published JORC 2012 compliant mineral resources
in the order of 664Mt at 56.9% Fe for the Cochrane/Jewel, Trixie, Kens Bore and Red Hill Creek
deposits1. These deposits are proximal to, or within, the Hamersley Range and occur approximately
40km ‘upstream’ from the eastern boundary of E08/3424.
The Cane Bore exploration license application area covers a meandering palaeochannel hosting
outcropping CID that is more than 30km long with an average width of 400 metres (see Figure ).
The CID paleochannel appears semi-continuous, indicating that it may be well preserved.
Available satellite and drone imagery and, topographic data suggest that the mesa-forms rise to
20m from the surround, flat-lying ground. However, depth below the base of the outcrop is
unknown, and there is potential a thicker and higher-grade CID profile. No drilling appears to have
completed within the tenement application area. Typical CID mesa-forms at Cane Bore are
presented in Photo 1 above.
Work completed by API Management Pty Ltd on CID deposits, approximately 40km up-channel
(see Figure 2), has resulted in published mineral resources in the order of 664Mt at 56.9% Fe2. In the
local region, significant CID resources (or reserves) have been reported including:
• Ken’s Bore of 394 Mt at 56.4% Fe3 Mineral Resources Ltd

• Robe Messa of 33.4 Mt at 55% Fe4 CZR Resources Ltd
• Robe Valley of 326 Mt at 56.3% Fe5 Rio Tinto Iron Ore
Furthermore, Strike Resources have reported a resource of 9.6 Mt at 61.1 % Fe at Paulsens East6.
Access and Heritage Agreements
Access and Heritage Protection Agreements were signed by the Buurabalayji Thalanyji People
(Thalanyji) and the Puutu Kunti Kurrama People and Pinikura People #1 and #2 (PKKP) in 2022 and
2023, respectively. The Thalanjyi have Native Title over the Western section of the Exploration
License area; the PKKP have Native Title over the Southern section. Burley has met with
representatives of the Traditional Owners and is currently arranging heritage surveys over the
maiden drilling areas.
Next Steps
The Company is currently pursuing heritage survey proposals for the Cane Bore Iron Project while
it prepares the PoW application to DMIRS for approval with a view to commencing the maiden
drill programme as soon as possible. Burley’s geologists are now preparing to mobilise to site to
complete the initial mapping and rock-chip sampling programme at Cane Bore, whilst waiting for
approval of the drilling PoW

are Channel Iron Deposits (CID) which are alluvial
deposits associated with the palaeodrainage systems
of the Fortescue River and George River valleys.
• CIDs represent tertiary alluvial deposits, rich in
ferruginous fragments, which were eroded from the
country rock (Hamersley Surface) and deposited in
river channels. Where outcropping, CIDs occur as
variably dismembered, topographically inverted
palaeochannel deposits preserved along major
palaeodrainage lines.
• CIDs are primarily a clast-supported very-fine to very-
coarse sandstone to granule-conglomerate
comprised of iron-rich detrital material that has
undergone variable amounts of weathering and
alteration. The clasts are typically composed of
goethite ± hematite and fossil wood
