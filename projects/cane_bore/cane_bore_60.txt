Figure 1: Macro Tenure Portfolio as at 5 August 2024; red highlights new tenure
Macro Metals Limited (ASX: M4M) (Macro or the Company) is pleased to provide an update with
respect to a material increase in Macro’s tenure holding across the Pilbara region of Western
Australia.
The 25 new projects have all been acquired by Macro through direct licence application, which is
the lowest cost way of securing opportunities. Macro selected each project based upon evaluation
of mineral prospectivity utilising open file exploration information.
The Company’s rationale for acquiring such a large package of prospective land is to create a
pipeline of regionally proximal projects that can be progressively evaluated and developed to create
a multi-mine producer with diversity of commodity type and product specifications with a variety
of logistics pathways.
The Company’s technical team has immediately commenced the prioritising and ranking process
for these newly acquired targets and our future schedule of exploration programs will be created
using these respective priorities.
Mr Simon Rushton, Managing Director stated: “The board and I remain steadfast in
our vision and commitment to successfully building a sustainable, diversified mining
and mining services business.
We fully intend to create a multi-generational company that has a portfolio of
projects across a range of key commodity groups, starting with steel making
materials. We aim to have multiple small to medium-sized operating sites that
together provide Macro with long-life export operations from the Western and
Central/Eastern Pilbara regions.

I want to publicly acknowledge, commend and thank Rob Jewson for the time and
effort he has personally invested in building this portfolio of assets over the past four
months. Some of these targets are equally as exciting as Cane Bore, Catho Well,
Turner and Goldsworthy, so I am genuinely looking forward to getting agreements in
place with the various stakeholders to quickly unlock these tenements and have our
team members on the ground as we methodically run through our tenement
evaluation and development process.
Separate to our growing iron ore portfolio, we continue with due diligence into our
recently announced farm-in and joint venture agreement with Firebird. All going
well, we intend to apply for a bulk sample permit in the very near future and want to
maximise the size of the bulk samples that Macro Mining Services produces and
exports to various prospective customers overseas. With Utah Point being the
obvious multi-user facility for export of these bulk samples and that facility having a
clear preference for 100-110kt minicape vessels to maintain berth efficacy, we will seek
approval for two separate cargos to satisfy enquiries for bulk samples from steel
making customers.
Importantly for the Company’s cash reserves, the successful export of these two bulk
samples could potentially create material cash flow before the end of this calendar
year for Macro, as well as enabling us to engage in serious discussions with
prospective offtake partners for a future manganese project. The overwhelming
majority of any cash generated will be reinvested as working capital so we can
continue to fast track our exploration and evaluation efforts across our growing
portfolio of Pilbara assets without needing to dilute shareholders.”
Overview of certain new targets
The below provides a brief overview of just a selection of the new tenure that the Company applied
for during Q2/CY2024.
Bungaroo North Iron Ore Project
The Bungaroo North Iron Ore Project is located 30km south-east of Pannawonica. Bungaroo North
comprises two exploration licence applications, E47/5196 and E47/5198.
Bungaroo North is located within the Hamersley Group, comprises BIF’s dolomite, shale and minor
volcanics. During the Proterozoic deformation events, the rock units and groups of the Hamersley
Basin were folded. Substantial uplift followed resulting in large scale open folds throughout the
southwest Hamersley Basin.
Erosion and weathering of the regionally deformed and uplifted rock units provided an iron rich
gravel material to accumulate in fluvial systems. The result of this erosion and deposition is the
formation of the Tertiary Channel Iron Deposits.
Mineralisation at Bungaroo North is associated with the Robe River drainage system, which is host
to Channel Iron Deposits including Mesa J, operated by Rio Tinto.
Rock chip sampling completed by BC Iron between 2010 and 2013 identified high-grade CID/DID
mineralisation. Significant results include:
• 64.18% Fe, 1.69% Al O , 1.79% SiO , 0.084% P, 7.23% LOI- RE000848
2 3 2
• 63.95% Fe, 1.57% Al O , 1.43% SiO , 0.086% P, 8.96% LOI- RE000846

• 63.17% Fe, 2.51% Al O , 2.48% SiO , 0.068% P - X079210
2 3 2
• 63.12% Fe, 2.51% Al O , 2.14% SiO , 0.091% P, 7.47% LOI – RE000845

Mr Rob Jewson, Technical Executive Director, said:
“Bungaroo North has the potential to be a very high-grade valley fill CID/DID drill target
that warrants immediate sampling and mapping to define the surface extent of
mineralisation.”
Figure 2: Bungaroo North Rock Chip Sampling Results (Fe%)
Six Mile Well Iron Ore Project
The Six Mile Well Iron Ore Project is located 16km south of Pannawonica and directly adjacent to
Rio Tinto’s Mesa J Mine. Six Mile Well is comprised of two exploration licence applications, E08/3731
and E47/5190.
The Six Mile Well Project is underlain by the outcropping rocks of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation
with partial colluvial cover. The Marra Mamba Iron Formation is host to numerous major iron ore
deposits in the Hamersley Province. Mapping and sampling completed by FMG in 2021 reported
zones of outcropping hematite mineralisation as bedded iron type deposit targets. Significant rock
chip results include:
• 63.51% Fe, 0.79% Al O , 4.56% SiO , 0.03% P - X079211
2 3 2
• 63.15% Fe, 1.30% Al O , 2.75% SiO , 0.088% P - X079212

Mr Rob Jewson, Technical Executive Director, said:
“Six Mile Well is advantageously located directly adjacent to road infrastructure and
contains, similarly to Bungaroo North, very high surface grades of iron with low deleterious
elements. Due to the proximity between Bungaroo North and Six Mile Well, both Projects
will undergo mapping and sampling in the coming weeks.”
Figure 3: Six Mile Well Rock Chip Sampling Results (Fe%)
Nammuldi North Iron Ore Project
The Nammuldi North Iron Ore Project is located 55km northwest of Tom Price and directly adjacent
to Rio Tinto’s Nammuldi Mine. Nammuldi North is comprised of a single exploration licence
application, E47/5169.
The Nammuldi Project is underlain by the outcropping rocks of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation.
Mapping completed by Hammersley Iron Pty Limited in 2003 (Wamex Report, A67857) identified
goethite mineralised zones of the Nammuldi Member within the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. No
previous drilling or sampling has been identified. These two discrete zones of goethite
mineralisation extend for a total cumulative strike of 900m.
Mr Rob Jewson, Technical Executive Director, said:
“Nammuldi North represents a bedded iron type deposit style which is yet to be sampled to
determine the grade and deleterious element profile. Its significance is the scale of the
target and potential operational synergies with the Turner Project located 20km south.”

Deposit 13 Iron Ore Project
The Deposit 13 Iron Ore Project is located 90km west northwest of Tom Price. Deposit 13 is
comprised of a single exploration licence application, E47/5161.
The Deposit 13 Project is underlain by the Brockman Formation and mineralisation is hosted within
a steep limb of a large northwest southeast trending drag fold with mineralisation dipping steeply
north eastwards. A single rock chip sample was taken by BHP in 1972:
• 61.3% Fe, 0.9% Al O , 3.00% SiO , 0.095% P, 7.60% LOI - AE8171
2 3 2
Mr Rob Jewson, Technical Executive Director, said:
“Deposit 13 represents a high-grade bedded iron type target which has only had a single
sample reporting very high-grade iron and low deleterious elements since 1972.”

Figure 5: Deposit 13 Project
Mt Margaret North Iron Ore Project
The Mt Margaret Iron Ore Project is located 250km northwest of Newman and 7km east of Macro’s
Mt Pyrton Project. Mt Margaret North comprises a single exploration licence application, E47/5194.
The Mt Margaret Project is located on the boundary of the Hamersley Ranges and the Fortescue
Basin. Deep incised valleys consist of sediments and Cainozoic alluvial and colluvial cover which
drain into the Fortescue Basin.
Mapping and sampling by Royal Resources in 2008 and subsequently Brockman Mining in 2015-16
defined zones of canga-style mineralisation capping, 20-30m in places. Rock chip sampling of this
canga mineralisation returned results of:
• 59.71% Fe, 2.64% Al O , 1.84% SiO , 0.091% P, 9.57% LOI - BM001

About Macro Metals Limited
Macro’s Iron Ore portfolio has the potential for multiple sources of iron ore production utilising the
well-established and proven export infrastructure of the Pilbara and emerging infrastructure in the
West Pilbara.
Utilising a fit for purpose, safety and results focused, rapid development approach across the Macro
assets the Board sees substantial scale and the real potential for Macro to quickly become a multi
mine iron ore producer.
The Company recently announced the launch of its specialised mining services division, Macro
Mining Services (MMS). MMS will provide value add mining services across the key activities of
exploration mapping and drilling, mining, load and haul, crushing and screening and logistics and
port handling management services. The vision for MMS is to not only provide safe and cost
effective services on wholly Macro owned projects, but also to form strategic partnerships with
junior exploration companies where Macro obtains a meaningful stake in a project and MMS then
provides the life of mine, pit to customer mining services to joint venture partners.
In July 2024, Macro announced an agreement with Firebird Metals Limited (ASX: FRB or Firebird)
to acquire 80% of FRB’s manganese tenements in the Pilbara. Should a decision to mine be made,
then MMS will be awarded the life of mine, pit to port mining services in respect of minerals to be
exploited from those tenements.
