YARDILLA PROJECT – Option Exercised
 Cullen Metals Pty Ltd, “Cullen” or “the Company,” a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cullen Resources Limited, has signed a Binding Term Sheet to
acquire up to a 90% interest in Exploration Licence Application E63/2463 (~
150 sq. km) in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia ("Application" or
"Tenement") – ASX:CUL; 28-11-2024.
 Cullen has now completed its due diligence of the Application, and paid the
Vendors $25,000 in exchange for all Intellectual Property and Mining
Information held by the Vendors.
 A Heritage Protection Agreement is being progressed to allow for granting of
the tenement.
 Cullen Exploration Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cullen Resources
Limited, has applied for adjoining ground (100% - E63/2487), which is not part
of the Option-to-Purchase, to create a substantial combined land package of ~
325 sq. km - the Yardilla project. It is centered about 90 km east of Norseman
and is readily accessible from the Eyre Highway
 Yardilla is located along the south eastern margin of the Yilgarn Craton within
Proterozoic, reworked, metamorphosed, and altered Archaean rocks in a
geological setting like that at the giant Tropicana gold deposit, which may serve
as a useful model for Cullen’s gold exploration (Fig.1).
 E63/2463 includes the Lila, Lila West, Ten Mile Rocks and Cleanthes
Prospects which together form a target trend of ~25km of imbricate thrust
sheets and cross-cutting faults/thrusts at the Proterozoic and Archaean boundary
- ASX:CUL;6-2-2025 (Fig.2).
 RAB drilling has only tested the Lila and Cleanthes prospects in the regolith
(ASX: CUL;16-1-2025 and 28-1-2025) and neither Lila West nor the Ten Mile
Prospect has ever been drilled.

tenements is shown (figure modified after Spaggiari et al., 2011: The geology of

Fig. 2. Gravity image (from WAMEX A99973) superimposed on mag image (from
Fig.4) underlines focus of soil anomalies along the thrusted boundary between low
density Proterozoic granitic gneiss, and the Archaean to the north, west and south.
Black faults and thrusts are extracted from Geoview: “1;500,000 linear structures
layer”. Red dashed lines are cross faults/thrusts interpreted by Cullen, which may
control the location of some soil anomalies.

ATTRIBUTION: Competent Person Statement
The information in this report that relates to exploration activities is based on information compiled
by Dr. Chris Ringrose, Managing Director, Cullen Resources Limited who is a Member of the
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Dr. Ringrose is a full-time employee of Cullen
Resources Limited. He has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and
types of deposits under consideration, and to the activity which has been undertaken, to qualify as a
Competent Person as defined by the 2012 edition of the “Australasian Code for Reporting of
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves”. Dr. Ringrose consents to the report
being issued in the form and context in which it appears. Information in this report may also reflect
past exploration results, and Cullen’s assessment of exploration completed by past explorers, which
has not been updated to comply with the JORC 2012 Code. The Company confirms it is not aware of
any new information or data which materially affects the information included in this announcement.
ABOUT CULLEN: Cullen is a Perth-based minerals explorer with a multi-commodity portfolio
including projects managed through a number of JVs with key partners (Rox, Capella and Lachlan
Star), and a number of projects in its own right. The Company’s strategy is to identify and build
targets based on data compilation, field reconnaissance and early-stage exploration, and to pursue
further testing of targets itself or farm-out opportunities to larger companies. Projects are sought for
most commodities mainly in Australia but with selected consideration of overseas opportunities.
Cullen has a 1.5% F.O.B. royalty up to 15 Mt of iron ore production from the Wyloo project
tenements, part of Fortescue’s Western Hub/Eliwana project, and will receive $900,000 cash if and
when a decision is made to commence mining on a commercial basis – from former tenure including
E47/1649, 1650, ML 47/1488-1490, and ML 08/502. Cullen has a 1% F.O.B. royalty on any iron
ore production from the following former Mt Stuart Iron Ore Joint Venture
(Baowu/MinRes/Posco/AMCI) tenements – E08/1135, E08/1330, E08/1341, E08/1292, ML08/481,
and ML08/482 (and will receive $1M cash upon any Final Investment Decision). The Catho Well
Channel Iron Deposit (CID) has a published in situ Mineral Resources estimate of 161Mt @ 54.40%
Fe (ML 08/481) as announced by Cullen to the ASX – 10 March 2015.
