core drilling, according to publically available databases: see References

Cullen Metals Pty Ltd – Binding Term Sheet  
1) Cullen signed the Binding Term Sheet on the 27-11-24 (Execution Date), and will pay the 
Vendors $15,000 for a period of up to 3 Months from the Execution Date for exclusivity to 
conduct due diligence on the Application (E63/2463) and underlying area of the 
Application. 
2) Subject to satisfactory due diligence and at Cullen’s absolute discretion, Cullen will pay the 
Vendors $25,000 in exchange for all Intellectual Property and Mining Information held by 
the Vendors associated with the Application. 
3) Cullen may acquire up to a 90% legal and beneficial interest (Earn-In Interest) in the 
Application and Tenement (E63/2463), on and from the Commencement Date (the granting 
of the Application) by making the following payments and solely funding exploration up to 
a Decision to Mine: 
 Cullen may acquire an initial 20% interest in the Tenement (Stage 1 Interest) by paying 
the Vendors $30,000 within 15 Business Days of the Commencement Date; 
 Subject to, and conditional upon, Cullen earning the Stage 1 Interest, Cullen may acquire 
a further 20% interest in the Tenement (Stage 2 Interest) by commencing and 
concurrently announcing on the Cullen Resources market announcements platform an 
initial air core and/or RC drilling programme within the Project Area (Drilling 
Announcement) within 18 Months from the Commencement Date. Within 5 Business 
Days of the Drilling Announcement, Cullen must also pay the Vendors $30,000;  
 Subject to, and conditional upon, Cullen earning the Stage 2 Interest, Cullen may acquire 
a further 20% interest in the Tenement (Stage 3 Interest) by paying the Vendors 
$100,000 at any time prior to the date which is 2 years from the date of the Drilling 
Announcement; and 
 Subject to, and conditional upon, Cullen earning the Stage 3 Interest, Cullen may acquire 
a further 30% interest in the Tenement (Stage 4 Interest) by paying the Vendors 
$150,000 at any time prior to the date which is 3 years from the date of the Drilling 
Announcement. 
4) The total cost payable to the Vendors for Cullen to earn the full 90% Earn-In Interest is 
$350,000 (exclusive of GST). 
5) Cullen can withdraw prior to earning the Earn-In Interest provided they give 30 days' notice 
in writing; the Tenement is pro-rata in good standing and Cullen meets all requirements and 
demands of relevant statutory authorities regarding environmental rehabilitation for any 
damage caused by Cullen prior to the withdrawal. 
6) On the completion of all payments (the Earn-In Date), Cullen and the Vendors (the 
Participants) will be associated in an unincorporated joint venture (JV) to explore for 
minerals on the Tenement on the terms and conditions set out below (and otherwise based 
on the model joint venture agreement published by the Energy and Resources Law 
Association (formerly AMPLA Ltd)), and in which the initial Joint Venture Interests of 
the Participants will be:

8) Cullen will sole fund the JV until the date of a Decision to Mine (Sole Funding Period). 
During the Sole Funding Period all decisions regarding JV expenditure and the extent, 
nature, timing and conduct of Exploration will be made solely by Cullen. 
9) After the Sole Funding Period, if a Participant fails to contribute to Joint Venture 
Expenditure in accordance with their Joint Venture Interest when called, the Joint Venture 
Interest of that Participant shall be diluted in accordance with a straight-line formula that 
takes into account actual and deemed funding by each Participant, and if any Participant's 
Joint Venture Interest falls below 5%, such Participant's Joint Venture Interest will reduce to 
zero and will automatically be converted to a gross revenue Royalty, payable by the Joint 
Venture to such Participant. If the Vendors have their respective Joint Venture Interest 
diluted to a holding lower than 5%, each will be granted a separate Royalty (both Royalties 
aggregating to 3%). 
10) A Participant may withdraw from the JV by giving 30 days’ written notice to the other 
Participants. The withdrawing party is responsible for its share of the costs and liabilities 
incurred prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

ABOUT CULLEN: Cullen is a Perth-based minerals explorer with a multi-commodity portfolio 
including projects managed through a number of JVs with key partners (Rox, Fortescue, Capella 
and Lachlan Star), and a number of projects in its own right.  The Company’s strategy is to 
identify and build targets based on data compilation, field reconnaissance and early-stage 
exploration, and to pursue further testing of targets itself or farm-out opportunities to larger 
companies. Projects are sought for most commodities mainly in Australia but with selected 
consideration of overseas opportunities.
