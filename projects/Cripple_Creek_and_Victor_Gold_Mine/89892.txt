# SSR Mining Announces Closing of Cripple Creek & Victor Acquisition

SSR Mining Inc. (Nasdaq/TSX: SSRM; ASX: SSR) (“SSR Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the completion of the previously announced acquisition (the “Transaction”) of the Cripple Creek & Victor (“CC&V”) gold mine from Newmont Corporation (“Newmont”) on February 28, 2025. As consideration for the Transaction, SSR Mining made a $100 million cash payment to Newmont, with up to $175 million in additional milestone-based payments to be made in the future. 

CC&V is expected to meaningfully increase SSR Mining’s scale, free cash flow and portfolio diversification, and positions the Company as the third largest gold producer in the U.S.A. As of December 31, 2024, CC&V hosted 2.4 million ounces of gold Mineral Reserves, an 85% year-over-year increase from the 1.3 million ounces of gold Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2023. Newmont also reported an additional 0.8 million ounces of Measured and Indicated gold Mineral Resources and 0.9 million ounces of Inferred gold Mineral Resources  for CC&V as of December 31, 2024. SSR Mining expects to publish a technical report and life of mine plan for CC&V within the next 12 months. 

With the closing of the Transaction, production and free cash flow from CC&V are attributable to SSR Mining effective March 1, 2025. The Company anticipates reporting consolidated full-year 2025 production and cost guidance, including attributable guidance for CC&V, before the end of the first quarter. 

Rod Antal, Executive Chairman of SSR Mining, said, “We are thrilled to welcome CC&V and its team to SSR Mining. This transaction adds another long-lived, free cash flow generative asset to the portfolio, and we look forward to showcasing our longer-term plans for the operation.”

**_Information Regarding CC &V _ **

_All information related to CC &V’s 2023 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources is derived solely from Newmont Corporation’s (“Newmont”) press release (“Newmont Announces 2023 Mineral Reserves for Integrated Company of 136 Million Gold Ounces with Robust Copper Optionality of 30 Billion Pounds”) dated February 22, 2024, and all information related to CC&V’s 2024 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources is derived from Newmont’s press release “Newmont Reports 2024 Mineral Reserves of 134.1 Million Gold Ounces and 13.5 Million Tonnes of Copper”, dated February 20, 2025, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Newmont, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2025 (collectively, the “Newmont Disclosures”). You should closely review the Newmont Disclosures in their entirety to learn about the risk, considerations and qualifications to which this information is subject. We have not independently verified the information derived from the Newmont Disclosures. These “historical estimates” (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties (“NI 43-101”)) are provided solely for information purposes and have not been independently verified by SSR Mining. These historical estimates are based on work completed and estimates prepared by Newmont, they are not current and should not be treated as SSR Mining’s current estimates of Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources at CC&V. _

_Newmont’s Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for 2024 were based on a gold price assumption of $1,700 per ounce for Mineral Reserves and $2,000 per ounce for Mineral Resources. Newmont’s Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for 2023 were based on a gold price assumption of $1,400 per ounce for Mineral Reserves and $1,600 per ounce for Mineral Resources._

_Newmont has not prepared a technical report summary in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 1300 under Regulation SK of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a technical report in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101, and Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have not been calculated in accordance with NI 43-101. As a result, the production estimates made by SSR Mining are based on the Newmont Disclosure and have not been prepared, reviewed or verified by an independent, third-party qualified person and no such qualified person has done sufficient work to classify the Newmont Disclosures as Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves as prescribed by Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101 and SSR is not treating the historical estimate as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves for purposes of Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101._
