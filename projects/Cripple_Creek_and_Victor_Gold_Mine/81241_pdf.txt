    *   CC&V is expected to add approximately 170,000 ounces in annual gold production.
    *   The Company's total U.S. gold production is expected to average between 300,000 - 400,000 ounces annually.
*   **Accretive across all key metrics, with staged milestone-based consideration preserving balance sheet strength**

    *   Upfront consideration represents less than 10% of SSR Mining's current market capitalization.
*   **CC&V is expected to provide meaningful operating and free cash flow generation to support high-return growth initiatives**
    *   Newmont's 2024 guidance for CC&V of 170,000 ounces of gold production at an AISC of $1,610 per ounce.
*   **Adds a long-lived, established operation with meaningful brownfield upside to the SSR Mining platform**
    *   As of December 31, 2023, Newmont reported that CC&V had gold Mineral Reserves of approximately 1.3 million ounces, plus an additional 1.6 million ounces of Measured & Indicated Mineral Resources and 0.3 million ounces of Inferred Mineral resources.
*   **Leverages SSR Mining's proven track record**
    *   SSR Mining's in-house expertise operating the large tonnage operations at Marigold in Nevada is expected to help ensure the successful integration of CC&V.

**Rod Antal, Executive Chairman of SSR Mining, said,** “The acquisition of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine represents a rare opportunity to add a high-quality producing asset in a Tier-1 jurisdiction at an accretive valuation."

### Transaction Overview
Consideration for the acquisition of CC&V is comprised of:
*   A $100 million cash payment to be paid on closing of the Transaction.
*   Up to $175 million of milestone-based payments in cash, of which:
    *   $87.5 million will be payable upon final approval of the application to amend the CC&V Cresson Permit ("Amendment 14").
    *   Up to $87.5 million will be payable upon obtaining regulatory relief relating to flow-related permitting requirements for the Carlton Tunnel.

The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.
