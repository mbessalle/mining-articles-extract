Highlights
• Kali Metals Limited (ASX: KM1) (“Kali” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce it has entered into a
binding agreement with Florance Resources Pty Ltd which will see Kali:

Paul Adams, Managing Director of Kali Metals commented:
“Kali is very pleased to have finalized negotiations to acquire exploration licences E45/6429 and
E45/6430 from Florance Resources. With gold prices reaching record highs this month, Kali is
maintaining a key focus on the gold prospectivity of its 100%-owned Marble Bar Project in the Pilbara.
This new acquisition bolsters Kali’s landholding in this highly prospective gold region.
The recent exploration results at Marble Bar have been extremely promising. Reconnaissance to date
has identified two Prospects (Tiger and Sherman) with gold-bearing quartz veins on surface measuring
up to 7m in width, 120m in length and 4.0g/t on surface2, and we have only mapped 10% of our recently
discovered >9km gold-in-soil anomaly.
Our increased gold footprint in the Pilbara gives the Company the best chance to identify and define
potential gold targets for future drilling, and we look forward to commencing exploration on these
promising new tenements.”
