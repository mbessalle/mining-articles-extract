• As economies with large populations (eg. China, India) modernise, • Current mines face depleted grades
copper demand grows
• Copper exploration is not delivering substantial new deposits
• New age technologies (eg. electric vehicles, data centres) require

High Grade Copper Production History
One of Australia’s highest grade historic copper mines
• At Gulf Creek the copper occurs within three
parallel sulphide lenses
• Cornish Lode averaged 6 - 6.5% Cu
• Middle Lode averaged 3 – 3.5% Cu
• Big Lode averaged 2 – 2.5% Cu
• Mine samples show visible mineralisation in
the areas surrounding the main lodes
• Zinc assays show similar copper values
• No drilling has occurred based on modern
day exploration techniques
Historic mine plan showing 3 main lodes
As disclosed in publications by the Geological Survey of New South Wales such as:

After driving through sixteen feet of country rock, impregnated with
metalliccopper,a lode of black sulphide ore was struck averaging twelve
per centcopper,which, without a doubt, is one of the finestcopperlodes
found in Australia. Other crosscuts were driven, and these proved that
this enormous (second) ore body is running parallel with the old one.
When the ore was proved in the forty-eight feet level, crosscuts were
driven west at the ninety-eight feet level and these proved that the lode
was going down. From the old lode the north drives forty-eight feet, and
ninety-eight feet have produced some fine ore. The old main shaft was
sunk by the new Company to 168 feet, and a winze was also sunk in the
old lode to this level, from the 98, carrying ore all the way down.

Appendix 1: Gulf Creek History
1896 Discovery of high-grade gossanous samples at surface at Gulf Creek. Maitland Daily Mercury (1901)
1896-1912 Underground mine and on-site smelter – for a period, the best in the country employing 300 to 500 workers (Carne, 1908, Maitland Daily
Mercury, 1904, 1911, Manilla Express, 1899).
1912 Mine closed due to low copper prices and lack of transport logistics for product. (Maitland Daily Mercury, 1911)
1963-1964 Carpentaria Exploration (a subsidiary of Mt Isa Mines) conducted surface mapping and drilled two holes. One hole intersected old workings
and was terminated. The other hole drilled beneath the plunge of the mineral system, missing the main lodes, yet intersected copper and
silver mineralisation (no assays for zinc) over 3m. Carpentaria Exploration (1965) & Darlington (1964)
1967 Austminex reviewed the region for copper deposits as part of regional exploration. Austminex (1967).
1971-1975 Serpentine Resources and Western Mining Corporation reviewed the region as part of extensional exploration of the Woodsreef asbestos
mine located ~20km to the south of Gulf Creek; highlighting the presence of regional prospectivity for high-grade copper. Hall (1971),
Mckenna, 1987.
1982 Newmont Holdings assessed the area principally for gold associated with copper mineralisation, and withdrew citing poor outcrop
hampering mapping and prospecting activities. Newmont (1982)
1991– 1993 University of New England conducted geological investigations of the sediments and volcanics, including potential for Volcanogenic
Massive Sulphides. McCarron (1991), Lawie, (1993)
1992 - CRA Ltd mapped the regional geology and despite concluding there was potential for additional stacked lenses of blind mineralisation,
withdrew from the project. CRA, 1992
2001-2002 Rimfire Pacific explored the area, though their exploration was focused elsewhere in the region principally towards gold and diamonds.
Rimfire (2001,2002)
2006-2007 Graynic Minerals conducted surface reconnaissance and IP Geophysics. Despite identifying several high priority targets, did not undertake
any drilling. Graynic (2006,2008)
2011-2012 Corazon Minerals conducted reconnaissance and a scoping study showing as little as 2 to 3Mt of ore could be economic in this area.
Corazon (2011-2013); Byass & Roberts (2011)
2013-2014 Peel Mining conducted a review, concluding that Gulf Creek was a promising target, but could not divert exploration budget from their
projects in Cobar Basin. Marshall, (2013, 2014).
2017-2022 – Downes and Comet Resources carried minor amount of soil sampling and reconnaissance, and fly drone magnetics. This included
permitting for drilling, but due to delays on Heritage (now solved) and other issues, did not continue with the project, Laursen
(2017, 2018, 2019) & Rampe (2020, 2021, 2022)
2024 OD6 Metals agrees to acquire the project from Downes and is committed to the first substantial drill program on the project.
