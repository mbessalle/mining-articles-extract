ASX Announcement
30 October 2024
ASX: OD6
Acquisition of one of Australia’s Highest-Grade,
Historical Copper Mines
OD6 Metals Limited (OD6 or the Company) is delighted to announce the proposed
acquisition of the Historic Gulf Creek Copper Project—a high grade volcanogenic massive
sulphide (VMS) deposit located near the town of Barraba in New South Wales (the Gulf
Creek Project or Project).
Highlights:
• High-Grade Copper–Zinc VMS style deposit – historic underground mining averaged 2 to 6.5% Cu1
• Mined over 100 years ago (1896-1912) - with +100m vertical and +300m strike open in multiple
directions
• Mineralisation is associated with magnetite with geophysics showing repeat structures to the north
and west of existing Gulf Creek workings
• Significant greenfields and brownfields exploration potential with over >3km of untested strike
in the immediate mine-stratigraphy, and over >10km across the tenement
• Favourable deal metrics and structure based on $200k cash, and 6,000,000 shares, plus a deferred issue
of $200k shares (subject to shareholder approval) or cash on commencement of Phase 2 drill program
• Strong near-term catalysts with exploration to commence imminently - fully permitted to drill Phase
1 program around the historical workings
Brett Hazelden, Managing Director, commented:
“OD6 has reviewed over 40 potential new projects and is pleased to announce that we have entered into binding
documentation to acquire the license over the historic Gulf Creek Copper mine and its surrounding area, in NSW.
The project was mined at the turn of the last century, between 1896 and 1912, with very high grades averaging
between 2 to 6.5% Copper within the three main lodes. Exploration prospectivity is immense as there has been no
modern exploration of substance since the mine closed, with only two drill holes completed more than 60 years ago.
We intend to apply modern exploration technologies and have identified the linkage between copper and magnetite
in the shallow historic workings. Based on a review of a recent 2021 drone magnetic survey there is potential of over
10km of untested magnetic VMS target horizon.
Copper is rapidly becoming a critical mineral in Australia, with NSW recently announcing a royalty deferral program
for developing critical minerals projects. OD6 is committed to rapidly advancing this early-stage prospect and the
opportunity to build a larger copper focussed portfolio.”
1 The Competent Person cautions that while the Mines Department records in this instance have been collected in
accordance with official provisions at the time, they are not absolute measures of the tenor or quantity of mineralisation.
The Competent Person considers that these records provide a reasonable indication of the tenor of grades and potential
volumes of mineralisation present.

Gulf Creek Copper Project Background
The Gulf Creek Project is a historic high-grade Copper–Zinc, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) style deposit
that was mined from underground over 100 years ago (1896-1912) to +100m vertical depth and +300m of
strike. Historic records 2 describe the mineralisation as occurring within three parallel sulphide zones:
• Cornish Lode averaged 6% to 6.5% Cu
• Middle Lode averaged 3% to 3.5% Cu
• Big Lode averaged 2% to 2.5% Cu
Historic workings at the Gulf Creek Project will form the basis of initial exploration, the last drilling being two
holes, which were drilled in the 1960’s. As the Project has seen very little modern exploration and there are
numerous untested targets as well as potential for a larger and more expansive high-grade Cu–Zn system with
multiple repeat structures.
The exploration license, EL8492 (Tenement), covers an area of 2,375ha and is located near the town of Barraba,
approximately 400km by road to the port of Newcastle and 550km north of Sydney. The project geology sits
along the Peel Fault and encompasses the historic Gulf Creek and Murchison copper mines (see Figure 1).

These average grades were not reported in accordance with the provisions of the JORC Code or its precedents and the
Competent Person advises appropriate caution be exercised on the part of investors, potential investors or their advisers.
The Competent Person considers that the reported grades are indicative of but not absolute measures of the tenor of
mineralisation present at Gulf Greek.

The Project sits in a classic setting for Besshi Style Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposit (VMS). This Silurian-
Devonian age geologically is analogous to the Woodlawn Deposit (>20Mt @ 1.6% Cu, 9.1% Zn endowment)3
owned by Develop Global Ltd.
Initial Exploration Focus – Gulf Creek Historical Workings
A Phase 1 program has been designed to test the area in and around the historical workings and is fully
permitted to commence during early 2025. The permitted program consists of a 14 hole, 1,500 to 3,000m
diamond or RC drill program.
OD6 will investigate the use of downhole geophysics as a suitable targeting technique for mineralisation within
100m of drill holes.
The Company will examine re-processing and reinterpretation of Induced Polarisation (IP) and drone magnetics
with the latest modeling techniques.
A new drone geophysical survey across the whole tenement will also be considered.

Extensional Exploration Near Gulf Creek
The Cu–Zn mineralisation has a strong association between magnetite and massive sulphide units. This
association has been studied by students at the University of New England.4 This relationship permits use of
magnetic geophysics to identify targets that can be further tested with further geophysics and drilling.
A 2021 drone magnetics survey, shown in Figures 3 and 4 matches known mineralisation over +300m strike-
length of the historic ore-body, and identified additional magnetic anomalies which may contain sulphide
bodies.
Induced Polarisation (IP) Chargeability geophysics, to potentially map subsurface sulphide minerals, has been
utilised in a small area surrounding the historic workings with results being coincident with extensional magnetic
targets to the northwest.
The extended magnetic survey in Figure 3, indicates a series of NW plunging folds providing >3km of local
strike length of target high grade magnetite-VMS target horizons within the Gulf Creek Syncline.
The Competent Person cautions that this geophysical work is used to map potentially magnetic minerals
(magnetic survey) or sulphide minerals (IP chargeability survey), and that subsequent physical sampling may not
return results of economic interest.
Drilling in this area is planned as part of a future Phase 2 program.

Regional Exploration Potential
The 2021 drone magnetics survey was extended north to the historic Murchison Mine, which is also associated
with magnetic stratigraphy, as seen in Figure 4, and reported with copper grades up to 4%.5
There appears to be significant folded magnetic stratigraphy completely untested with potentially over
>10km of magnetic VMS target horizon.
Further follow up geophysics and drilling in this area is planned as part of a future program.

About OD6 Metals
OD6 Metals is an Australian public company pursuing exploration
and development opportunities within the critical mineral sector.
The Company has successfully identified clay hosted rare earths at
its 100% owned Splinter Rock and Grass Patch Projects, which are
located in the Esperance-Goldfields region of WA - about 30 to
150km northeast of the major port and town of Esperance.
REE are becoming increasingly important in the global economy,
with uses including advanced electronics and permanent magnets
electric motors in electric vehicles, wind turbines and robotics.
An updated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for the flagship
Splinter Rock Rare Earths Project was released in May 2024 and has
confirmed that Splinter Rock hosts the largest and highest-grade
clay-hosted rare earths deposit in Australia with a Resource of 682Mt @ 1,338ppm TREO.
The Splinter Rock MRE indicates that high-value Magnetic Rare Earths (MagREE) such Neodymium (Nd), Praseodymium (Pr),
Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb) represent ~23% of the deposit.
Metallurgical testing using hydrochloric acid to leach the rare earths have resulted in positive REE recoveries with
optimisation ongoing. The Inside Centre Prospect is a main focus of the company given its metallurgical recoveries, high
grade, low strip ratio and its considerable thickness.
As part of the exploration process the Company has entered into heritage agreements with Esperance Tjaltrjraak Native Title
Aboriginal Corporation and the Ngadju Native Title Aboriginal Corporation that serves to both enable exploration and protect
important cultural sites on Country.

Gulf Creek History
1896 Discovery of high-grade gossanous samples at surface at Gulf Creek. Maitland Daily Mercury (1901)
1896-1912 Underground mine and on-site smelter – for a period, the best in the country employing 300 to 500 workers (Carne, 1908,
Maitland Daily Mercury, 1904, 1911, Manilla Express, 1899).
1912 Mine closed due to low copper prices and lack of transport logistics for product. (Maitland Daily Mercury, 1911)
1963-1964 Carpentaria Exploration (a subsidiary of Mt Isa Mines) conducted surface mapping and drilled two holes. One hole intersected
old workings and was terminated. The other hole drilled beneath the plunge of the mineral system, missing the main lodes, yet
intersected copper and silver mineralisation (no assays for zinc) over 3m. Carpentaria Exploration (1965) & Darlington (1964)
1967 Austminex reviewed the region for copper deposits as part of regional exploration. Austminex (1967).
1971-1975 Serpentine Resources and Western Mining Corporation reviewed the region as part of extensional exploration of the
Woodsreef asbestos mine located ~20km to the south of Gulf Creek; highlighting the presence of regional prospectivity for
high-grade copper. Hall (1971), Mckenna, 1987.
1982 Newmont Holdings assessed the area principally for gold associated with copper mineralisation and withdrew citing poor
outcrop hampering mapping and prospecting activities. Newmont (1982)
1991– 1993 University of New England conducted geological investigations of the sediments and volcanics, including potential for
Volcanogenic Massive Sulphides. McCarron (1991), Lawie, (1993)
1992 CRA Ltd mapped the regional geology and despite concluding there was potential for additional stacked lenses of blind
mineralisation, withdrew from the project. CRA, 1992
2001-2002 Rimfire Pacific explored the area, though their exploration was focused elsewhere in the region principally towards gold and
diamonds. Rimfire (2001,2002)
2006-2007 Graynic Minerals conducted surface reconnaissance and IP Geophysics. Despite identifying several high priority targets, did not
undertake any drilling. Graynic (2006,2008)
2011-2012 Corazon Minerals conducted reconnaissance and a scoping study showing as little as 2 to 3Mt of ore could be economic in
this area. Corazon (2011-2013); Byass & Roberts (2011)
2013-2014 Peel Mining conducted a review, concluding that Gulf Creek was a promising target, but could not divert exploration budget
from their projects in Cobar Basin. Marshall, (2013, 2014).
2017-2022 Downes and Comet Resources carried out minor amount of soil sampling and reconnaissance, and fly drone magnetics. This
included permitting for drilling, but due to delays on Heritage (now solved) and other issues, did not continue with the project,
Laursen (2017, 2018, 2019) & Rampe (2020, 2021, 2022)
2024 OD6 Metals agrees to acquire the project from Downes and is committed to the first substantial drill program ever on
the project.
