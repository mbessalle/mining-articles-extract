About OD6 Metals
OD6 Metals is an Australian public company pursuing exploration and development opportunities within the critical
minerals sector, namely rare earths and copper.
Copper
The Company is advancing the Gulf Creek Copper-Zinc VMS Project located near the town of Barraba in NSW,
Australia.
Gulf Creek was mined at around the turn of the 20th century and was once regarded as the highest grade copper mine
(2% to 6.5% Cu) in NSW until its closure due to weak copper prices in 1912. Very little exploration has occurred at the
project in over 100 years, with OD6 aiming to apply modern day exploration technologies.
Mineralisation is associated with magnetite, with geophysics showing significant greenfields and brownfields
exploration potential exists with over >3km of untested strike in the immediate mine-stratigraphy, and over >10km
across the tenement.
Rare Earth
OD6 Metals has successfully identified clay hosted rare earths at its 100% owned Splinter Rock and Grass Patch
Projects which are located in the Esperance-Goldfields region of Western Australia.
The Company released a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for Splinter Rock in May 2024, confirming that the project
hosts the largest and highest-grade clay-hosted rare earths deposit in Australia with a Indicated Resource of 119Mt @
1,632ppm TREO and a Inferred Resource of 563Mt @ 1,275ppm TREO with an overall ratio of ~23% high-value
Magnetic Rare Earths (MagREE).
OD6 Metals believes that Splinter Rock has all the hallmarks of a world class rare earths project with a conceptual
development which utilises the large and high-grade Splinter Rock resource to support a long-life REE operation
supported by a low strip ratio
