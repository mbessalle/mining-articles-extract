INTRODUCTION 
The Company has entered into a binding Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with Chinova Resources 
Osborne Pty Ltd (Chinova) to acquire the highly complementary Trekelano copper gold 
deposit, which is located within a 20km radius of the existing high-grade Greater Duchess 
Project deposits (Figure 1). Under the ASA, Carnaby will acquire a 100% interest in the three 
mining leases, ML90128, ML90125 and ML90183 (Trekelano) (the Acquisition).  
To fund the Acquisition and ongoing works Carnaby is pleased to announce it has received 
firm commitments from new and existing institutional and sophisticated investors to raise 
approximately $17.0 million via a two-tranche placement of approximately 54.8 million new 
fully paid ordinary shares in the Company (New Shares) at an issue price of $0.31 per New 
Share (Placement). Glencore International AG or an affiliate (Glencore) has agreed to 
subscribe for ~10.7 million New Shares under tranche 1 of the Placement. In addition to the 
Placement, the Directors have committed to subscribe for $500,000 on the same terms as the 
Placement, subject to shareholder approval being obtained in accordance ASX Listing Rule 
10.11. 
The proceeds from the Placement will be used to fund Acquisition costs (including stamp duty 
and Estimated Rehabilitation Cost (ERC) Bonds), the Greater Duchess Pre-Feasibility Study 
(PFS), including the integration of Trekelano into the PFS, exploration and resource growth 
drilling as well as for general working capital purposes. 
Additionally, Carnaby has entered into a binding Tolling and Offtake Term Sheet with Glencore 
relating to the Greater Duchess Project with a commitment from Glencore to take 100% of the 
fresh sulphide ore and concentrate produced from the Project.  
 
GREATER DUCHESS COPPER GOLD PROJECT 
TREKELANO ACQUISITION (CNB 100%) 
Strategic Rationale 
Trekelano represents a rare bolt on high-grade copper resource in close proximity to Carnaby’s 
existing resources and includes an inferred JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 
5.2Mt @ 1.39% Cu, 0.36g/t Au, 1.64% CuEq, 85kt CuEq across three deposits (Tables A & 
B), delivering an immediate material increase in scale and critical mass to de-risk the Greater 
Duchess Project development. The deposits are expected to materially increase the potential 
annual production target by increasing the open pit target mine life and may also provide a 
fast track to commencement of production at the Project given they are located within granted 
mining leases. As such, the Trekelano deposits are expected to yield the fastest route through 
 
3 
 
permitting and into production of all the Greater Duchess deposits and have the potential to 
be the first mined due to its production history, environmental bonds already in place and 
baseline monitoring data which has already been established. 
 
Figure 1. Trekelano & Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project Location Plan 
Trekelano is located only 15km from Duchess along an existing road and is located within a 
20km radius of the existing Greater Duchess deposits. Given its high grade and close proximity 
to the CNB Greater Duchess deposits, railway and roads, Trekelano forms a highly synergetic 
asset that will add critical mass to the camp of IOCG deposits that Carnaby has discovered 
over the last three years.   
The main Mount Isa railway passes through Duchess as shown in Figure 1. A rail siding exists 
at Duchess and the potential to re-purpose the siding to be able to onload ore will form part 
of the PFS to determine optimal haulage options.  
 
4 
 
The Duchess deposit itself, which comprises a Mineral Resource of 3.7Mt @ 0.8% CuEq, is 
located approximately 500m from the Duchess siding and will also be economically evaluated 
as part of the PFS.  
Trekelano is also located 8km from the main Phosphate Road which is sealed over the entire 
length to Osborne and to Cloncurry to the north.   
Acquisition Terms 
On Completion of the Acquisition under the ASA, the Company will hold a 100% interest in 
Trekelano. Completion is subject to the following conditions precedent being satisfied (or 
waived): 
1. Receipt of indicative tenement transfer approval from the Queensland Department of 
Resources for the transfer to Carnaby of the mining leases comprising Trekelano (which 
is either not conditional or on conditions satisfactory to the parties), and such indicative 
approval remaining valid for no less than 10 business days after satisfaction or waiver 
of the condition in item 2 below; and 
2. Environmental bond de-amalgamation approval from the Queensland Department of 
Environment, Science and Innovation (DESI) (i.e. separation of Trekelano from the 
broader Osborne Mine Environmental Authority to be approved by DESI) and an 
estimated rehabilitation cost decision having been made by the Scheme Manager for 
the Financial Provisioning Scheme for the de-amalgamated environmental authority. 
The Company has paid a A$3M cash deposit upon signing the ASA which is to be held in 
escrow until completion. Upon completion, as final consideration, the Company will transfer 
to Chinova a yet to be determined cash payment of ~A$6M. This final payment consists of 
A$7M minus the environmental bond required to be placed with Queensland Treasury by 
Carnaby upon completion of the Acquisition, which is currently estimated to be ~A$1.0M and 
will only be finalised upon the de-amalgamation of Trekelano from the broader Osborne Mine 
Environmental Authority. 
Trekelano Mineral Resource Estimate 
As part of the due diligence process Carnaby has commissioned an independent Mineral 
Resource Estimate (MRE) for the Trekelano deposits. A full summary of the MRE is presented 
in Table A and the Trekelano Mineral Resource Summary is included at the end of this release.  
The Trekelano total MRE is: 
5.2Mt @ 1.4% Cu, 0.4g/t Au, 1.6% CuEq for 85,000t CuEq 
The high grade Trekelano deposit is complimentary to Carnaby’s existing MRE (see ASX release 
27 October 2023) and will result in a pro forma 27% increase to the Greater Duchess MRE. 
 
5 
 
Proforma combined MRE at Greater Duchess is: 
27.0Mt @ 1.3% Cu, 0.2g/t Au, 1.5% CuEq for 400,000t CuEq.  
Trekelano History 
The Trekelano mine has a proven history of high grade copper production, first producing 
188,000t @ 10.9% Cu during 1911-1945 from underground operations prior to Barrick Gold 
Corporation (Barrick) mining 2.4Mt @ 1.6% Cu, 0.42g/t Au from 2006-2009 from two open 
pits (Inheritance and Trekelano 2) (Figure 2). Ore from the Barrick open pits was processed at 
the Osborne copper-gold processing facility with operations ceasing due to the post-GFC 
complications. As such the primary Inheritance open pit, which was not mined to its full extent 
due to a now resolved mining lease boundary limitation, still contains a significant high grade 
copper gold resource below the open pit. 
 
Figure 2. Trekelano Mining Leases Plan. 
 
6 
 
A total of approximately 50,000m of RC and diamond core drilling has been historically drilled 
into the mining leases comprising Trekelano. 
Inheritance Deposit Upside 
As a result of the historical Inheritance open pit mined by Barrick during the GFC being 
constrained to the mining lease boundary of ML90125, a significant high grade portion of the 
orebody remains unexploited beneath the open pit (Figure 4). A mining lease application to 
allow for a larger pit was subsequently granted (ML90183) during the GFC however the larger 
open pit did not commence presumably because of poor prevailing economic conditions. 
 
Figure 3. Inheritance Cross Section 7624310N. 
Below the open pit are spectacular drill hole intersections of up to 93m @ 5.2% Cu, 1.1g/t 
Au (Figure 3). Several of these vertical holes were drilled from close to the bottom of the open 
pit towards the end of mining of the original open pit. A summary of these significant 
downhole intersections is shown below. As these holes were vertically drilled the true width is 
in the order of 40 to 50m wide: 
• 
TRRC0151 
93m @ 5.2% Cu, 1.2g/t Au from 55m 
• 
TRRC0152 
93m @ 2.4% Cu, 1.1g/t Au from 40m 
• 
TRRC0157A 128m @ 1.7% Cu, 0.4g/t Au from 32m 
• 
TRRC0153 
118m @ 1.9% Cu, 0.7g/t Au from 33m 
 
7 
 
The full drilling results from all holes intersecting the Trekelano Copper Gold Project are set 
out in Appendix One of this release. 
Carnaby plans to drill some angled infill holes across these broad high grade sections to 
confirm width and grade of the mineralisation and to collect metallurgical samples. 
The mineralisation beneath the open pit averages approximately 40m true width by 250m 
strike by 100m depth (Figure 4). Mineralisation remains completely open at depth and the 
main zone appears to be plunging moderately to the south however is also open to the north. 
Carnaby intends to complete extensional drilling targeting the south plunge and will likely use 
down hole EM to refine targeting. 
The Inheritance Mineral Resource of 2.9Mt @ 1.3% Cu, 0.3g/t Au, 1.5% CuEq will be 
incorporated into the Pre-Feasibility Study and will undergo an optimisation study including 
geotechnical drilling to determine whether the high grade mineralisation can be economically 
extracted by an open pit cutback or whether underground extraction will be more compelling 
from a potential decline from the base of the historical open pit.

Trekelano 1 Deposit – Historical Trekelano Underground Mine 
The Trekelano mine was continuously worked as an underground operation from 1911 to 
1945. Total recorded production was 188,000t @ 10.9% Cu. The underground workings were 
mined to approximately 245m below surface and were extremely selectively mined over 
narrow 1-2m wide stopes. Subsequent drilling has shown that the orebody is considerably 
wider in both the hangingwall and footwall with significant remnant mineralisation remaining 
insitu over a true width of approximately 10m. Carnaby considers there is excellent potential 
for an open pit to be developed over the historical underground workings to recover remnant 
mineralisation. 
A JORC Mineral Resource has been estimated at Trekelano mine of 1.5Mt @ 1.7% Cu, 0.5g/t 
Au, 2.0% CuEq. 
 
Figure 5. Trekelano 1 Cross Section. 
Previous exploration drilling below the historical workings intersected spectacular high grade 
intervals which remain completely open at depth (Figure 5), results include: 
TRNQ0165 
 
8m @ 10.6% Cu,3.3g/t Au from 266m 
AND   
 
8m @ 3.5%, 0.7g/t Au from 281m 
 
9 
 
 
TRNQ0166 
 
17m @ 7.2% Cu, 1.7g/t Au from 236m 
 
TRNQ0163 
 
15m @ 4.3% Cu, 0.7g/t Au from 255m 
The full drilling results from all holes intersecting the Trekelano Copper Gold Project are set 
out in Appendix One of this release. 
The Trekelano mine is also open to the south downplunge from where a downhole intersection 
of 4m @ 4.5% Cu, 0.3g/t Au has been recorded. Carnaby intends to complete economic 
evaluation of the Trekelano mine mineralisation. 
Trekelano 2 Deposit  
The Trekelano 2 deposit was mined as a shallow open pit by Barrick to a maximum depth of 
65m (Figure 6). The mineralisation extends over approximately 200m of strike and up to 30m 
wide and is completely open at depth below the level of drilling at approximately 100m below 
surface. Carnaby considers there is high potential for a modest open pit cutback. 
A JORC Mineral Resource has been estimated for the Trekelano 2 deposit of 0.9Mt @ 1.2% 
Cu, 0.3g/t Au, 1.4% CuEq. 
 
Figure 6. Trekelano 2 Long Section.

Trekelano Near Mine Corridor 
The Trekelano granted mining leases cover a highly prospective corridor over an area of 3.7 
km2. The northern mining lease in particular has had minimal exploration drilling even though 
it is directly along strike from the mineralised corridor to the south (Figure 2). 
Carnaby considers the Trekelano Near Mine corridor as highly prospective and while some 
geophysics including SAM, gravity and FLTEM has been completed, there remain highly 
prospective target areas that require follow up EM or IP surveys.   
 
TOLLING AND OFFTAKE TERMS WITH GLENCORE AGREED 
Carnaby has entered into a binding Tolling and Offtake Term Sheet with Glencore relating to 
the Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project and will complete definitive documentation for the 
tolling and offtake shortly. This significant long-term partnership is a commitment from 
Glencore to take 100% of the fresh sulphide ore and concentrate produced from the Project.  
The term sheet clears a path for Carnaby to pursue the preferred low up-front capex 
development pathway for the Project. However, key project optionality has been retained with 
an option for Carnaby to terminate the tolling agreement with 24 months written notice to 
Glencore upon a final investment decision by Carnaby to build a copper concentrator at the 
Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project. 
Some additional key terms are summarised as follows: 
• 
Ore delivery and processing schedules to be mutually agreed ahead of mining and 
processing of sulphide ores.  
• 
Ore delivery FCA Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project (Carnaby pay agreed ore 
Freight credit) or Carnaby delivers the ore DAP Processing facility. 
• 
Sales price for the metals contained in the copper concentrate is in line with the market 
commercial terms for copper concentrate, including adjustments for penalties, 
benchmark treatment and refining charges and a freight credit.  
• 
Tolling arrangement is on customary terms and conditions for a contract of this nature, 
including:  
• 
agreed tolling charge, which reflects current market rates for copper ore 
processing in the Mount Isa region of Queensland; and 
• 
agreed process for assaying, weighing, sampling and moisture determination 
in relation to copper concentrate produced.

Trekelano Mineral Resource Summary 
Mineral Resource Statement Overview 
A Mineral Resource estimate for the Trekelano project was completed in November 2024 by 
Payne Geological Services Pty Ltd (PayneGeo). The project comprises three separate deposits 
each of which has been mined historically either by underground (Trekelano 1) or by open pit 
(Inheritance, Trekelano 2). The underground mining was relatively small scale and occurred 
between 1911 and 1945. The open pit mining was carried out between 2006 and 2009 as 
satellite pits to the Osborne Copper Project. 
The mineralisation at Trekelano has been estimated using assay data from 202 surface drill 
holes. All drilling at the project is historic, completed between 1961 and 2012.  
The Inheritance and Trekelano 1 deposits have been modelled to a depth of 330m below 
surface while Trekelano 2 has been modelled to a depth of 150m vertical. Mineralisation has 
been modelled using a 0.3% Cu envelope to define the deposits which have been reported at 
a copper equivalent (“CuEq”*) cut-off grade of 0.5% CuEq above 100mRL (220m vertical depth) 
and at a cut-off grade of 1.0% CuEq below 100mRL.  
A summary of the Trekelano November 2024 Mineral Resource is provided in Table B below.

Geology and Geological Interpretation 
The Trekelano lease is located in the Kalkadoon - Leichardt belt of the Proterozoic Mount Isa Block. 
The Mount Isa Inlier is a multiply deformed and metamorphosed terrane subdivided into three 
blocks, the Western Fold Belt, the Kalkadoon - Leichhardt block and the Eastern Fold Belt, which are 
bounded by major north striking fault zones.  
 
Trekelano lies in the Mary Kathleen Zone of the Kalkadoon - Leichhardt belt, and is 5km west of the 
Pilgrim Fault Zone, the bounding structure between the Kalkadoon - Leichhardt belt and the Eastern 
Fold belt.  
The dominant lithologies on the Trekelano lease area are biotite schists and scapolitic granofels of 
upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies. The structure is dominated by north-south trending 
shear zones which dip 60-70o to the west. Shears commonly contain brecciated material ranging 
from matrix to clast supported breccias with rounded to angular clasts of altered host rock. 
The geometry for each of the deposits is consistent with mineralisation parallel to the main regional 
shearing. At Inheritance, mineralisation consists of several sulphide rich lenses within a 30-50 metre 
wide shear zone. At the minor deposits, the sulphides occur in steeply dipping tabular veins up to 
1m in thickness within broader shear zones. Typically, there is a continuously mineralised hanging 
wall shear and footwall shear, northeast striking splays off the mineralised hanging wall, and 
extensive but irregular breccia zones between the two shears. 
Primary mineralisation is chalcopyrite, pyrite and magnetite, with minor bornite and marcasite. 
Small isolated occurrences of galena, sphalerite and molybdenite have been recorded. Cobaltite is 
distributed throughout the chalcopyrite as small inclusions. The main gangue mineral is calcite, with 
subordinate amounts of actinolite, tremolite, augite, epidote and garnet. Quartz is rare. Gold occurs 
uniformly throughout with chalcopyrite. 
The base of oxidation occurs at 5-20m below surface.  
Drilling Techniques 
The Trekelano drilling database (TREK_DrillingDB_MGA.mdb) includes records for 1,117 drill 
holes for 52,666m of drilling. In addition, records for 2 surface costeans for 39m were included 
in the database. All drill holes and channel samples were completed by previous operators 
between 1961 and 2012.  
The Trekelano Mineral Resource is intersected by 200 drill holes and 2 costeans. The drilling 
include 87 RC holes and 113 DD holes for a total of 28,248m. Holes drilled prior to 1989 were 
excluded from the estimate. Holes have been drilled at a consistent azimuth of approximately 
075o to provide intersections on a relatively regular spacing orthogonal to the mineralisation. 
 
15 
 
The upper 150m of the deposit has been systematically intersected at 20m to 30m hole 
spacings. In the deeper part of the deposit the hole spacings are up to 60m. There is no drilling 
below the base of the reported Mineral Resources and the mineralisation remains open down 
plunge at each of the deposits.  
Drill hole collars were either surveyed in or transformed to MGA coordinates using RTK GPS 
or traditional survey methods. Down hole surveys were recorded for all drilling using either 
north seeking gyro or magnetic instruments.  
Sampling and Sub-sampling Techniques 
No details for the drilling and sampling procedures have been located for the Trekelano drilling. 
The majority of resource drilling was carried out by reputable companies after 2000, so it is expected 
that industry standard procedures and quality drilling equipment were utilised.  
Based on database records it is clear that RC samples were at 1m intervals for all drilling. It was 
reported that in RC drilling completed from 2004, samples were collected via a rig mounted riffle 
splitter. The majority of RC holes were sampled and assayed for the full length of the hole. Others 
appear to have been selectively sampled, also at 1m intervals. 
Core from diamond drilling was typically sampled to lithological boundaries then at 1m intervals 
within the mineralised zones. It appears that much of the core was not sampled where it was 
considered unmineralised. 
Core recovery from diamond drilling is not known but drilling conditions are expected to have been 
good with all core being drilled in fresh rock.  
Sample Analysis Method 
Since 1994, all samples were submitted to ALS laboratories in Brisbane, Townsville or Mount 
Isa and analysed for copper using aqua regia digest and AAS-ICP analysis and for gold using 
fire assay and AAS analysis. Assay methods prior to 1994 were not documented.  
Quality control data was collected from drilling carried out from 2003. QAQC data was not 
available for review however previous reports state that the data confirmed the quality of the 
assay data. The extensive and successful mining operation carried out at the project is 
considered by the Competent Person to further validate the data underpinning the current 
Mineral Resource. 
Estimation Methodology 
Mineralisation interpretations were prepared using 0.3% Cu envelopes. This was based on 
statistical analysis suggesting a natural cut-off to the mineralisation of 0.3% Cu. The wireframes 
were used as hard boundaries to all grade estimation. 
 
16 
 
The deposit was estimated using ordinary kriging (“OK”) grade interpolation of 1m composited 
data within the main mineralisation wireframes. Only copper and gold were estimated within 
the mineralisation wireframes. 
Interpolation parameters were based on the geometry of each mineralised zone and 
geostatistical parameters determined by variography. Search ranges of 40m with a minimum 
of 8 samples and maximum of 16 samples were used for grade estimation. These were 
expanded as required to allow interpolation in areas of sparse drilling.  
High grade cuts were applied to copper and gold. At Inheritance and Trekelano 1 a cut of 16% 
Cu and 4g/t Au was applied. At Trekelano 2 a high grade cut of 10% Cu was applied. 
The block dimensions used in the model were 10m NS by 5m EW by 10m vertical with sub-
cells of 2.5m by 1.25m by 2.5m. The parent block size was selected on the basis of kriging 
neighbourhood analysis (“KNA”) and is approximately 50% of the average drill hole spacing in 
the upper, well drilled part of the deposit. 
An extensive database of density determinations was available however due to the lack of 
information on methodology, the wide range of values recorded and the general tendency of 
pycnometer methods to overstate bulk density, it was considered that the arithmetic averages 
of the data (2.9t/m3 to 3.02t/m3) may not be appropriate. A reduced value of 2.85t/m3 was 
considered appropriate and aligns better with values determined for the CNB Greater Duchess 
deposits. For oxide and transitional material, no determinations were available so assumed 
values of 2.1t/m3 for oxide and 2.4t/m3 for transition were applied to the model. 
Mineral Resource Classification 
The detailed drilling at Trekelano is sufficient to confirm the continuity and extent of the 
mineralisation within the drilled extent of the deposit. There is limited drilling below the limit 
of the Mineral Resource and the main zones of mineralisation all remain open down plunge.  
At each of the Trekelano deposits, the geometry of the mineralisation is well defined and the 
continuity of grade and geology is clearly demonstrated through most of the deposit where 
drilling is at 20m to 30m spacings. Further confidence is gained from the successful modern 
mining history of the project as reported by Barrick in 2010. In addition, the new estimate 
reconciles well with the reported mine production. 
Typically, this confidence would allow a substantial portion of the deposit to be classified as 
Indicated Mineral Resource. However, the underlying dataset used to interpret and estimate 
the data is entirely historic, with no original records available to verify the data. A number of 
holes with clearly erroneous data have been excluded from the estimate but there is a 
possibility that other unrecognised errors remain in the data.  
 
17 
 
As a result, the Competent Person considers that the entire deposit should be classified as 
Inferred Mineral Resource until verification of historic data can be carried out, and when 
confirmatory drilling has been completed that supports the historic data.  
Copper Equivalent Calculation 
Copper is the dominant metal within the deposit however gold is present at sufficient levels 
that it may contribute to the economic potential of the deposit. Consequently, the combined 
value of copper and gold was considered by preparing a copper equivalent (“CuEq”) value 
within the model. 
For consistency of reporting of the Carnaby Mineral Resource inventory, the copper equivalent 
calculation from the 2023 Greater Duchess Mineral Resource estimates was utilised (see ASX 
release 27 October 2023). The CuEq calculation is CuEq=Cu% + (Au_ppm * 0.7) and is based 
on September 2023 spot prices of US$8,500/t for copper and US$1,950/oz for gold and an 
exchange rate of $AUD0.67 to $USD1.00. The use of current spot commodity prices would 
result in a slight increase to the CuEq grade for the project. 
Production records and 2006 Feasibility Study test work demonstrate that the Trekelano 
mineralisation is amenable to conventional processing as carried out at the Osborne Copper 
Mine. As specific metallurgical data was not available for the remaining resources at Trekelano, 
the parameters for the copper equivalent calculation were based on metallurgical test work 
from the Greater Duchess mineralisation. Copper and gold recovery values of 95% copper and 
90% gold are based on preliminary metallurgical test work carried out by Australian Minmet 
Metallurgical Laboratories in 2022. Results were reported by Carnaby in a release to ASX dated 
7 November 2022 and June 2023. 
Cut-off Grades 
The reporting cut-off grade of 0.5% CuEq was derived considering the potential for open pit 
mining of the upper portion of the deposit considered to be above 100mRL (220m vertical). It 
is unlikely that open pit mining will extend for the full depth extent of the reported Mineral 
Resource however there are clearly portions of the deposit with excellent potential for 
underground mining. Consequently, below 100mRL the deposit was reported at a 1.0% CuEq 
cut-off grade. As mining studies are developed and the mining scenario is clarified, the cut-
off grade should be modified accordingly. 
Metallurgy 
Metallurgical test work was completed by Placer Dome as part of the 2006 Feasibility Study 
for development of the Inheritance and Trekelano 2 open pits for processing at Osborne.  
Results demonstrated copper recovery of 85-98% and gold recovery of 42-90% based on the 
Osborne flowsheet.  
 
18 
 
The historic test work provides confidence that the project is amenable to conventional 
processing and supports the parameters used in the CuEq calculations. 
Modifying Factors 
No modifying factors were applied to the reported Mineral resources. Parameters reflecting 
mining dilution, ore loss and metallurgical recoveries will be considered during the planned 
mining evaluation of the project. 
The reported Mineral Resource has been depleted to account for the underground workings 
at Trekelano 1, and for the open pit operations at Inheritance and Trekelano 2.

APPENDIX TWO 
JORC Code, 2012 Edition | ‘Table 1’ Report 
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
  
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g., cut 
channels, random chips, or specific 
specialised 
industry 
standard 
measurement tools appropriate to the 
minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld 
XRF instruments, etc). These examples 
should not be taken as limiting the broad 
meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate 
calibration 
of 
any 
measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects 
of 
the 
determination 
of 
mineralisation that are Material to the 
Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work 
has been done this would be relatively 
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was 
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 
kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as 
where there is coarse gold that has 
inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg 
submarine 
nodules) 
may 
warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
• 
Since 2004, RC samples were collected at 1m 
intervals via a rig mounted riffle splitter to provide 
a 3kg sample. 
• 
Details of older RC drilling were not provided.   
• 
Diamond core was half cut typically on 1m or less 
intervals within the mineralised zone. One half of 
the core sampled on the same side was submitted 
to the lab for analysis. 
 
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (e.g., core, reverse circulation, 
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core 
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of 
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc). 
• 
Since 2004 RC holes were completed using a 5.5’’ 
face sampling bit. 
• 
Since 1989 diamond holes in the current 
announcement were completed using NQ size core. 
• 
Previous diamond drilling was undertaken using a 
combination of BQ sized core. 
Drill 
sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core 
and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature 
of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential 
loss/gain 
of 
fine/coarse 
material. 
• 
Sample recovery has not been documented. 
• 
Previous Mineral Resource reports confirm that 
core loss in fresh rock was insignificant.  
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to 
a level of detail to support appropriate 
Mineral Resource estimation, mining 
studies and metallurgical studies. 
• 
Whether 
logging 
is 
qualitative 
or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography. 
• 
RC and DD holes have been logged for lithology, 
weathering, mineralisation, veining, structure and 
alteration.  
• 
Reports refer to core photography being carried out 
for all holes, however core photographs have not 
yet been provided. 
• 
All intersections have been logged in detail.

The total length and percentage of the 
relevant intersections logged. 
Sub-sampling 
techniques 
and 
sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, 
rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet 
or dry.

For all sample types, the nature, quality 
and appropriateness of the sample 
preparation technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all 
sub-sampling 
stages 
to 
maximise 
representivity of samples. 
• 
Measures taken to ensure that the 
sampling is representative of the in-situ 
material collected, including for instance 
results for field duplicate/second-half 
sampling. 
• 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to 
the grain size of the material being 
sampled. 
• 
Since 2004 all RC samples were riffle split at the rig 
to create a 1m sample of 3kg.  
• 
Diamond core was half-sawn and half core 
submitted for analysis. 
• 
In many holes, visually unmineralized intervals were 
not sampled. 
 
Quality of assay 
data 
and 
laboratory tests 
• 
The nature, quality and appropriateness of 
the assaying and laboratory procedures 
used and whether the technique is 
considered partial or total. 
• 
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, 
handheld XRF instruments, etc, the 
parameters used in determining the 
analysis including instrument make and 
model, reading times, calibrations factors 
applied and their derivation, etc. 
• 
Nature of quality control procedures 
adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, 
external laboratory checks) and whether 
acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of 
bias) and precision have been established. 
• 
Since 1994, all samples were submitted to ALS 
laboratories in Brisbane, Townsville or Mount Isa 
and analysed for copper using aqua regia digest 
and AAS-ICP analysis and for gold using fire assay 
and AAS analysis.  
• 
Assay methods prior to 1994 were not documented.

database system as part of the Osborne Copper 
Project.  
• 
No adjustment to assay grades has been 
documented

surveyed by Reflex True North seeking gyro.   
• 
Prior to 2004, down hole surveys used magnetic 
and gyroscopic downhole survey methods. 
 
Data spacing and 
distribution 
• 
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
Whether the data spacing and distribution 
is sufficient to establish the degree of 
geological 
and 
grade 
continuity 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and 
Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and 
classifications applied. 
• 
The upper 150m of the deposit has been 
systematically intersected at 20m to 30m hole 
spacings.  
• 
In the deeper part of the deposit the hole spacings 
are up to 60m.

exploration by other parties. 
• 
All exploration data used in the Mineral Resource 
estimate were completed by previous project 
operators.   
Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting and style 
of mineralisation. 
• 
The prospects mentioned in this announcement 
are located in the Mary Kathleen domain of the 
eastern Fold Belt, Mount Isa Inlier. The Eastern 
Fold Belt is well known for copper, gold and 
copper-gold 
deposits; 
generally 
considered 
variants 
of 
IOCG 
deposits. 
Deposits 
are 
structurally controlled, forming proximal to 
district-scale structures which are observable in 
mapped geology and geophysical images. Local 
controls on the distribution of mineralisation at 
the prospect scale can be more variable and is 
understood to be dependent on lithological 
domains 
present 
at 
the 
local-scale, 
and 
orientation with respect to structures and the 
stress-field during D3/D4 deformation, associated 
with mineralisation. 
• 
The dominant lithologies on the Trekelano lease 
area are biotite schists and scapolitic granofels of 
upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies. The 
structure is dominated by north-south trending 
shear zones which dip 60-70o to the west. Shears 
commonly contain brecciated material ranging 
from matrix to clast supported breccias with 
rounded to angular clasts of altered host rock. 
Drill 
hole 
Information 
• 
A summary of all information material to 
the understanding of the exploration 
results including a tabulation of the 
following information for all Material drill 
holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill 
hole collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in 
metres) of the drill hole collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down 
hole 
length 
and 
interception depth 
o 
hole length. 
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the 
basis that the information is not Material and this 
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of 
the report, the Competent Person should clearly 
explain why this is the case. 
• 
All intersections defining the Mineral Resource are 
listed in Appendix 1 of this release. 
Data aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (e.g., cutting 
of high grades) and cut-off grades are 
usually Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate 
short lengths of high grade results and 
longer lengths of low-grade results, the 
procedure used for such aggregation 
should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should be 
shown in detail. 
• 
No metal equivalent values have been reported in 
drilling results. 
• 
All reported intersections are based on length 
weighted averages.

Criteria 
Explanation 
Commentary 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of 
metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
Average 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths 
and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These 
relationships 
are 
particularly 
important in the reporting of Exploration 
Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a 
clear statement to this effect (e.g., ‘down 
hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
The majority of holes are considered to intersect 
the mineralisation at a reasonable angle, being 
drilled at an orthogonal angle to the principal 
strike of mineralisation. 
• 
A series of RC holes (TRRC0151-TRRC0158) were 
drilled as vertical holes from the pit floor. The true 
width of mineralisation in these holes is 
approximately half of the down hole width. 
 
 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with 
scales) and tabulations of intercepts 
should be included for any significant 
discovery being reported These should 
include, but not be limited to a plan view 
of 
drill 
hole 
collar 
locations 
and 
appropriate sectional views. 
• 
See the body of the announcement.  
 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and 
high grades and/or widths should be 
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
All resource intersections are included. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but 
not limited to): geological observations; 
geophysical survey results; geochemical 
survey results; bulk samples – size and 
method of treatment; metallurgical test 
results;

Confidence in (or conversely, the uncertainty 
of) the geological interpretation of the mineral 
deposit. 
• 
Nature of the data used and of any 
assumptions made. 
• 
The effect, if any, of alternative interpretations 
on Mineral Resource estimation. 
• 
The use of geology in guiding and controlling 
Mineral Resource estimation. 
• 
The factors affecting continuity both of grade 
and geology. 
• The 
confidence 
in 
the 
underlying 
geological 
interpretation is considered to be high and is based on 
extensive RC and core drilling. Outcrop is present as 
exposures in the walls of mine workings. 
• Three discrete deposit areas have been estimated within 
the project area. These include Inheritance, Trekelano 1 
and Trekelano 2. 
• Geochemistry and geological logging have been used to 
assist with identification of lithology, mineralisation and 
weathering. 
• The deposits consist of well defined zones of copper 
sulphide mineralisation within shear zones and alteration 
within the host biotite schists.  Copper is dominantly 
present within chalcopyrite. Gangue sulphides include 
pyrite and pyrrhotite. 
• The controlling lithologies are well defined. The 
mineralised zones typically have gradational boundaries, 
with the limit of mineralisation based on a copper cut-off 
grade. 
• Detailed drilling has confirmed geological and grade 
continuity in most areas of the deposits. 
Dimensions 
• 
The extent and variability of the Mineral 
Resource expressed as length (along strike or 
otherwise), plan width, and depth below 
surface to the upper and lower limits of the 
Mineral Resource. 
• The Inheritance deposit comprises a single main 
mineralised zone with a strike length of 300m, is 20m to 
40m thick and defined over a dip length of 330m. The 
deposit has been drilled and interpreted to a maximum 
vertical interval of 330m from surface. 
• The Trekelano 1 deposit comprises a single main 
mineralised zone with a strike length of 290m, is 4m to 
20m thick and defined over a dip length of 290m. The 
deposit has been drilled and interpreted to a maximum 
vertical interval of 290m from surface. 
• The Trekelano 2 deposit comprises a two main 
mineralised zones with a strike length of 250m, is 10m to 
30m thick and defined over dip length of 150m. The 
deposit has been drilled and interpreted to a maximum 
vertical interval of 150m from surface. 
Estimation and 
modelling 
techniques 
• 
The nature and appropriateness of the 
estimation technique(s) applied and key 
assumptions, including treatment of extreme 
grade values, domaining, interpolation 
parameters and maximum distance of 
extrapolation from data points. If a computer 
assisted estimation method was chosen 
include a description of computer software 
and parameters used. 
• 
The availability of check estimates, previous 
estimates and/or mine production records and 
whether the Mineral Resource estimate takes 
appropriate account of such data. 
• 
The assumptions made regarding recovery of 
by-products. 
• 
Estimation of deleterious elements or other 
non-grade variables of economic significance 
(eg sulphur for acid mine drainage 
characterisation). 
• Using parameters derived from modelled variograms, 
Ordinary Kriging (“OK”) was used to estimate average 
block grades in up to three passes using Surpac software. 
• Linear grade estimation was considered suitable for the 
deposits due to the generally well defined, disseminated 
nature of the mineralisation and the absence of erratic 
high grade outliers in most of the mineralised zones. 
• Maximum extrapolation of wireframes from drilling was 
120m down-dip in the strongest zone of Inheritance 
where the host lithology was confidently defined.    
• Gold occurs throughout all deposits and has been 
estimated. Metallurgical test work has confirmed the 
potential to recover gold as a byproduct of copper 
production.  
• Only copper and gold were estimated. 
• A single block model encompassed all zonesand parent 
block dimensions used were: 10m y by 5m x by 10m z with

sub-cells of 2.5m by 1.25m by 2.5m,  
• The parent block size dimension was selected on the 
results obtained from Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis 
and the drill hole spacing in the well drilled parts of the 
deposits.  
• For the Mineral Resource area, an orientated ‘ellipsoid’ 
search was used to select data and adjusted to account 
for the variations in zone orientations, however all other 
parameters were taken from the variography. Multiple 
passes with expanded search ranges were used for some 
domains. 
• A first pass search range of 40m with a minimum of 8 
samples and maximum of 16 samples were used.  
• Poor correlation was observed between Cu and Au. No 
assumptions about correlation were made in the estimate. 
• Within 
the 
Mineral 
Resource 
area, 
the 
deposit 
mineralisation 
was 
constrained 
by 
wireframes 
constructed using either a 0.2% Cu or 0.3% Cu cut-off 
grade. The wireframes were applied as hard boundaries. 
• Statistical analysis was carried out on data from the 
individual estimation domains.  High grade cuts were of 
16% (Inheritance and Trekelano 1) and 4% (Trekelano 2) 
were applied to copper. For gold, the moderate to high 
CV and the erratic distribution of high grade values 
observed on the histogram for some of the domains 
suggested that high grade cuts were required. Cuts of 
either 7g/t or 8g/t were applied to the estimates. 
• Validation of the models included detailed comparison of 
composite grades and block grades by strike, cross strike 
and elevation.  Validation plots showed good correlation 
between the composite grades and the block model 
grades. 
Moisture 
• 
Whether the tonnages are estimated on a dry 
basis or with natural moisture, and the 
method of determination of the moisture 
content. 
• Tonnages and grades were estimated on a dry in situ 
basis.   
Cut-off 
parameters 
• 
The basis of the adopted cut-off grade(s) or 
quality parameters applied. 
• The model has been reported at a cut-off grade of 0.5% 
CuEq for the portion of the deposit above 100mRL (220m 
vertical depth). A cut-off grade of 1.0% CuEq was applied 
to the portion of the deposit below 100mRL. 
• The reporting cut-off parameters were selected based on 
peer comparisons of similar deposits and the generally 
favourable geometry, magnitude and grade of each of the 
deposits suggesting good potential exists for eventual 
economic  extraction.  
Mining factors 
or assumptions 
• 
Assumptions made regarding possible mining 
methods, minimum mining dimensions and 
internal (or, if applicable, external) mining 
dilution. It is always necessary as part of the 
process of determining reasonable prospects 
for eventual economic extraction to consider 
potential mining methods, but the 
assumptions made regarding mining methods 
and parameters when estimating Mineral 
Resources may not always be rigorous. Where 
this is the case, this should be reported with 
an explanation of the basis of the mining 
• The substantial size and shallow nature of the of the 
mineralisation suggests that the deposits could be mined 
with open pit mining techniques. Higher grade zones 
within the deposits also show potential for underground 
mining if sufficient Mineral Resources can be defined. 
• Drilling has not yet tested the depth extensions of the 
deposits so the potential for underground mineable 
mineralisation has not yet been fully defined.

assumptions made. 
Metallurgical 
factors or 
assumptions 
• 
The basis for assumptions or predictions 
regarding metallurgical amenability. It is 
always necessary as part of the process of 
determining reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction to consider 
potential metallurgical methods, but the 
assumptions regarding metallurgical 
treatment processes and parameters made 
when reporting Mineral Resources may not 
always be rigorous. Where this is the case, this 
should be reported with an explanation of the 
basis of the metallurgical assumptions made. 
• Preliminary metallurgical test work completed for the 
Feasibility Study in 2004 has been completed and 
confirmed the amenability of the mineralisation to 
conventional processing. 
• The extensive production history confirmed that high 
copper and gold recoveries were achieved via flotation of 
sulphides into a concentrate.  
• Anticipated 
metallurgical 
recoveries 
vary 
between 
deposits and average values for the project have been 
estimated at 85 to 98% for copper and 40 to 90% for gold. 
Environmental 
factors or 
assumptions 
• 
Assumptions made regarding possible waste 
and process residue disposal options. It is 
always necessary as part of the process of 
determining reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction to consider the 
potential environmental impacts of the mining 
and processing operation. While at this stage 
the determination of potential environmental 
impacts, particularly for a greenfields project, 
may not always be well advanced, the status 
of early consideration of these potential 
environmental impacts should be reported. 
Where these aspects have not been 
considered this should be reported with an 
explanation of the environmental assumptions 
made. 
• No 
assumptions 
have 
been 
made 
regarding 
environmental factors.  Carnaby will work to mitigate 
environmental impacts as a result of any future mining or 
mineral processing. 
Bulk density 
• 
Whether assumed or determined. If assumed, 
the basis for the assumptions. If determined, 
the method used, whether wet or dry, the 
frequency of the measurements, the nature, 
size and representativeness of the samples. 
• 
The bulk density for bulk material must have 
been measured by methods that adequately 
account for void spaces (vugs, porosity, etc), 
moisture and differences between rock and 
alteration zones within the deposit. 
• 
Discuss assumptions for bulk density 
estimates used in the evaluation process of 
the different materials. 
• Bulk density values applied to the Mineral Resource were 
based on a substantial number of density determinations 
carried out on drill core and RC chips. Competent core 
was tested using immersion methods. 
• The results were considered high for the style of 
mineralisaiton and lower densities were applied to the 
model. 
• Oxide 2.1t/m3, transitional 2.4t/m3, fresh 2.85t/m3  
• At Trekelano 1, a density of 2.52t/m3 was applied to 
represent the mining depletion (155,000t reported 
mined). 
Classification 
• 
The basis for the classification of the Mineral 
Resources into varying confidence categories. 
• 
Whether appropriate account has been taken 
of all relevant factors (ie relative confidence in 
tonnage/grade estimations, reliability of input 
data, confidence in continuity of geology and 
metal values, quality, quantity and distribution 
of the data). 
• 
Whether the result appropriately reflects the 
Competent Person’s view of the deposit. 
• The Mineral Resource estimate is reported in compliance 
with the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves’ by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee 
(JORC). 
• The detailed drilling at Trekelano is sufficient to confirm 
the continuity and extent of the mineralisation within the 
drilled extent of the deposit. There is limited drilling below 
the limit of the Mineral Resource and the main zones of 
mineralisation all remain open down plunge. 
• At the Trekelano deposits, the geometry of the 
mineralisation is well defined and the continuity of grade 
and geology is clearly demonstrated through most of the 
deposit where drilling is at 20m to 30m spacings. Further 
confidence is gained from the successful modern mining 
history of the project as reported by Barrick, 2010. In

addition, the new estimate reconciles well with the 
reported mine production. 
• Typically, this confidence would allow a substantial 
portion of the deposit to be classified as Indicated Mineral 
Resource. However, the underlying dataset used to 
interpret and estimate the data is entirely historic, with no 
original records available to verify the data. A number of 
holes with clearly erroneous data have been excluded 
from the estimate but there is a possibility that other 
unrecognised errors remain in the data.  
• As a result, the Competent Person considers that the 
entire deposit should be classified as Inferred Mineral 
Resource until verification of historic data can be carried 
out, and when confirmatory drilling has been completed 
that supports the historic data. 
•  Extrapolation of the mineralisation was generally limited 
to 40m along strike and 100m down dip of drill hole 
intersections. 
• The input data is comprehensive in its coverage of the 
mineralisation and does not favour or misrepresent in-
situ mineralisation. The definition of mineralised zones is 
based on a high data density producing  robust models 
of mineralised domains. 
• Quantitative validation of the block models using swath 
plots and statistical comparison shows good correlation 
of the input data to the estimated grades. 
• The Mineral Resource estimates appropriately reflect the 
view of the Competent Person. 
Audits or 
reviews 
• 
The results of any audits or reviews of Mineral 
Resource estimates. 
• No audits have been completed. 
Discussion of 
relative 
accuracy/ 
confidence 
• 
Where appropriate a statement of the relative 
accuracy and confidence level in the Mineral 
Resource estimate using an approach or 
procedure deemed appropriate by the 
Competent Person. For example, the 
application of statistical or geostatistical 
procedures to quantify the relative accuracy of 
the resource within stated confidence limits, 
or, if such an approach is not deemed 
appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the 
factors that could affect the relative accuracy 
and confidence of the estimate. 
• 
The statement should specify whether it 
relates to global or local estimates, and, if 
local, state the relevant tonnages, which 
should be relevant to technical and economic 
evaluation. Documentation should include 
assumptions made and the procedures used. 
• 
These statements of relative accuracy and 
confidence of the estimate should be 
compared with production data, where 
available. 
• The deposit geometry and continuity have been 
adequately interpreted to reflect the classification applied 
to the Mineral Resource.   
• The majority of data is of good quality and the drill holes 
have detailed logs produced by qualified geologists.  A 
recognised laboratory has been used for the majority of 
analyses. 
• The Mineral Resource statement relates to global 
estimates of tonnes and grade after depletion for known 
mine production.
