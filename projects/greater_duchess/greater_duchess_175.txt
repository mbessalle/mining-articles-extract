Trekelano Acquisition

Trekelano Acquisition Overview
Highly complementary copper gold acquisition delivering an immediate
material increase in scale and critical mass at Greater Duchess
✓
Acquisition of 100% of the historical Trekelano mine, located within 20km radius
of the Greater Duchess deposits
✓
Includes a JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 5.2Mt @ 1.4% Cu,
0.4g/t Au, 1.6% CuEq, 85kt CuEq1,2 across three deposits:
1. Inheritance
2. Trekelano 1
3. Trekelano 2
✓
Trekelano will be immediately integrated into the Greater Duchess Pre-Feasibility
Study, with potential to:
1. increase annual production target
2. provide a potential fast track to production (given location on granted MLs)
✓
Significant potential for growth:
• Extensional - open pit and UG extensions
• Exploration upside – opportunity to utilise district proven geophysical
techniques of EM and IP to generate new undrilled targets in the mine
corridor

Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project
OUTLOOK AND VALUE DRIVERS
1. Ongoing growth drilling at Greater Duchess:
• Short term high potential for new discoveries in first pass drilling of
VTEM conductors is in progress with ~2,000m RC drilling program
• Target open pit mineral resource growth across Greater Duchess
2. H1 2025 Maiden drilling program at Trekelano:
• Extension drilling to increase the MRE
• Confirmatory angled diamond holes through the high-grade zones
below the open pits to collect metallurgical samples
• Geotechnical drilling to determine open pit and underground
parameters
3. Q1 2025 updated Greater Duchess Mineral Resource
4. PFS study on track to be completed mid 2025:
• Integration of Trekelano
• Resource extension and infill drilling – mostly completed
• Geotechnical drilling – completed except for Trekelano
• Mineral Resource Estimate – Q1 2025
• Metallurgical studies – mostly completed
• Permitting and baseline studies - ongoing
• Mining and civil engineering studies – being awarded, start Q1 2025

Please Note - Rounding discrepancies may occur.
Note 1: The CuEq calculation is CuEq=Cu% + (Au_ppm * 0.7) and is based on September 2023 spot prices of US$8,500/t for copper and US$1,950/oz for gold, exchange rate of 0.67 and recovery of 95% copper and 90% gold.
as demonstrated in preliminary metallurgical test work carried out in 2023.
