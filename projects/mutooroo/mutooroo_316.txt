MUTOOROO AGREEMENT WITH JX ADVANCED METALS 
 
 
Havilah Resources Limited (Havilah or the Company) (ASX: HAV) is pleased to advise that it has entered 
into a binding Memorandum of Understanding with JXAM of Japan, for an exclusivity period and study 
program relating to Mutooroo in northeastern South Australia near Broken Hill (Figure 1). 
The exclusivity may extend until 30 September 2025, during which time JXAM will fund a study program on 
Mutooroo that will inform its decision on whether to acquire an interest in Mutooroo as part of a potential 
transaction. Subject to the results of the study program, JXAM and Havilah will negotiate in good faith the 
terms of a legally binding agreement for the potential transaction during the exclusivity period. 
Exclusivity will cover the entire 23 km2 area of exploration licence 6592 and mining lease 5678 that lies 
within it that are both 100% owned by Havilah and/or its wholly owned subsidiary.

Expenditure on the study program will be almost $3 million, with approximately two-thirds directed 
towards resource expansion and resource upgrade drilling, with the balance split between metallurgical 
studies and mining/infrastructure/environmental/permitting studies. 
 
• A binding Memorandum of Understanding signed with JX Advanced Metals Corporation (JXAM) of Japan 
for an exclusivity period and study program on the Mutooroo copper-cobalt-gold project (Mutooroo). 
• This will involve JXAM spending almost $3 million on resource expansion and resource upgrade drilling and 
other studies on a non-recourse basis to inform its decision on whether to acquire an interest in Mutooroo.

Commenting on the JXAM study program Havilah’s Technical Director, Dr Chris Giles, said: 
“We are delighted to have formed a relationship with JXAM, who is at the forefront of sustainable copper 
production and processing of recycled material that minimises the usage of fossil fuel.  
“JXAM has a deep knowledge of the entire metals cycle from exploration to mining and processing, to 
smelting and refining and production of specialised modern age metal products. 
“We believe JXAM is the ideal partner to help us unlock the value of copper, gold, cobalt and sulphur in the 
Mutooroo massive sulphide ore and Havilah looks forward to working with JXAM on the study program.”  
About JX Advanced Metals Corporation (JXAM) 
JXAM is a large Japanese nonferrous metals enterprise that conducts global operations related to 
nonferrous metals such as copper and rare metals. JXAM started out in mining and smelting operations and 
has expanded to cover the full range of operations from manufacture of advanced materials, smelting and 
refining, recycling of metals from end-of-life equipment to resource development. 
An important and growing part of JXAM’s business is semiconductor materials. In order to ensure a stable 
supply of mineral resources necessary for this operation, JXAM considers developing not only copper mines 
but also rare metal mines (including cobalt).    
Another important and growing part of JXAM’s business is the collection and pre-treating of recycled raw 
materials which is becoming even more important. Such recycled raw materials are regenerated into 
copper, precious metals, and rare metals at JXAM’s Saganoseki Smelter & Refinery. JXAM is progressively 
increasing its processing of recycled materials using ‘Green Hybrid Smelting’, which makes full use of the 
oxidation reaction heat generated by the copper ore itself in the smelting process, to minimise the usage 
of fossil fuel. 
JXAM invests in large-scale copper mines, including Caserones (30%), Los Pelambres (12.52%) and 
Escondida (3%) in Chile, to ensure a stable supply of copper concentrates to the Saganoseki Smelter & 
Refinery in Japan, which has a copper production capacity of approximately 450,000 tonnes per annum. 
JXAM procures copper concentrates, undertakes copper smelting, and sells refined copper and smelting 
byproducts, including sulphuric acid, chemical products, precious metals, and rare metals.

About Mutooroo 
Mutooroo is Havilah’s 100% owned advanced stage copper-cobalt-gold project that is located within 
commuting distance of Broken Hill, and roughly 16 km south of the Transcontinental railway line and Barrier 
Highway. It contains 195,000 tonnes of copper, 20,200 tonnes of cobalt and 82,100 ounces of gold in a 
predominantly massive sulphide ore lode (see Mutooroo JORC resource table below). As such, Mutooroo 
is one of the larger and higher grade undeveloped copper-cobalt sulphide deposits in Australia. Such 
sulphide cobalt deposits are generally rarer and smaller than nickel-cobalt laterite deposits, but they usually 
have significant mineral processing cost advantages.  
Havilah has been progressing studies on the Mutooroo project to determine the feasibility of a potential 1 
million tonne per annum throughput copper and cobalt operation, based on current JORC Measured 
Resources, initially from an open cut mine that transitions to a longer-term underground mining operation. 
This aspirational objective is favoured by the comparatively high grades of copper (1.53%) and cobalt 
(0.16%) in the sulphide ore and could be further enhanced by discovery of additional sulphide resources, 
which is another objective of the study program. Any revenues from byproduct cobalt, gold and sulphur 
(potentially as sulphuric acid) could improve returns from the Mutooroo project and this will also be a key 
focus of the JXAM study program.  
This announcement has been authorised on behalf of the Havilah Board by Mr Simon Gray.
