GREENVALE EXPANDS AUSTRALIAN ENERGY PORTFOLIO
WITH ACQUISITION OF A SECOND HIGH-POTENTIAL
URANIUM EXPLORATION PROJECT IN THE NT
The Tobermorey Uranium Project sits on the south-eastern margin of the Georgina Basin in
the NT and includes multiple high-priority targets
Highlights:
• Greenvale enters into a binding Heads of Agreement with Gempart Pty Ltd to
acquire an initial 80% interest in the Tobermorey Uranium Project, located
400km east-north-east of Alice Springs in the Eastern Arunta Mineral Field.
• Tobermorey comprises two large Exploration Licences, EL33692 (356 km2) and
EL33621(615 km2).
• The Project is highly prospective for sandstone-hosted uranium mineralisation,
with multiple U/Th ratio and uranium anomalies occurring within an extensive
uraniferous palaeodrainage hosted by 8m thick Tertiary limestone.
• The largest anomaly is located on EL33621, trending south-east for 20km x
15km at its widest point.
• The Tobermorey Project represents a complementary addition to Greenvale’s
energy portfolio following its recent acquisition of the Douglas Uranium Project
in the Pine Creek Mineral Field of the NT.
• The Tobermorey Project has numerous walk-up drill targets, offering the
potential for cost-effective exploration using shallow drilling methods.
Greenvale Energy Limited (ASX: GRV, “Greenvale” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise
that it has further enhanced its Australian energy portfolio with the acquisition of a new
highly prospective sandstone-hosted uranium project located in the eastern Arunta region
of the Northern Territory.
Greenvale has entered into an acquisition agreement with Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd over
EL33621 and EL33692 (Figure 1), comprising the Tobermorey Uranium Project, which is
located 400km east north-east of Alice Springs and straddles the Plenty Highway on the
Northern Territory side of the NT/Queensland border.

Greenvale has secured the rights to obtain an immediate 80% interest in the two
tenements with the original project owners, Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd, being free-carried
through to a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). Greenvale has incurred a small upfront cost
of approximately $10,000 payable to Gempart as reimbursement of data acquisition costs
to secure its 80% Interest in the tenements.
Management Comment
Greenvale CEO, Mark Turner, said: “This represents another attractive addition to our
growing Australian energy portfolio, complementing the recently acquired Douglas Project.
Like Douglas, the Tobermory Project has proven prospectivity for large-scale sandstone-
hosted uranium deposits in an attractive geological setting and comes with multiple high-
priority exploration targets.
“Importantly, the nature of the mineralisation means we can explore using cost-effective
shallow air-core drilling techniques, making this a project that is easy to access and explore
– allowing us to advance it rapidly. We are looking forward to getting on the ground and
commencing exploration activity as soon as possible.”

The Project
The Tobermorey Project area is flat-lying and dominated by uraniferous palaeodrainage
related to extensively outcropping Tertiary Austral Downs Limestone which is up to 8
metres thick.
A 400m line spaced airborne magnetics/radiometric survey completed by the NTGS (in
1999) has defined multiple U and U/Th ratio anomalies (Figure 2.) which are concentrated
within extensive paleochannels hosted by Tertiary limestone.
The largest uranium anomaly is over EL33621 trending east-south-east for 20km, 15km at
its widest point, straddling the Plenty Highway about 10km from the NT-QLD border.
Other Cenozoic basins and palaeodrainages in Central and Southern NT are currently
being explored for uranium. Many parallels can be drawn between Tobermorey and the
calcrete-hosted uranium occurrences within and south of the Ngalia Basin including
Napperby, Currinya and Cappers.
The most significant deposit, Napperby, was discovered in 1977 by Uranerz by a regional
airborne radiometric survey and follow-up auger drilling program. The Napperby uranium
resource was last updated in October 2018 (Core Lithium ASX: CXO) and is quoted as a
2012 JORC Code-Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 9.45Mt @ 382ppm U O for 8.03

Proposed Exploration Program
• 100m line space (north-south lines) airborne magnetic/radiometric geophysical
survey. Figure 3.
• Ground scintillometer survey over airborne defined anomalies, field mapping rock
and chip sampling.
• Auger, air-core, sonic drilling depending on ground conditions.

Key Terms of the agreement
• The tenements vendor is Gempart (NT) Pty Ltd.
• Purchaser is Greenvale Utilities Pty Ltd a 100% subsidiary of Greenvale Energy Ltd.
• Greenvale to earn an 80% project interest by completing a Definitive Feasibility
Study. The 80% interest is transferred to Greenvale upfront.
• There is no time limit on completing the DFS, Greenvale to maintain tenements in
good standing for duration of earn in period.
• Greenvale may withdraw at any time and the tenements will revert to Gempart.

• Once Greenvale has earned its 80% interest Gempart can opt to contribute pro rata
to maintain its 20% interest or 1. Negotiate to sell its interest to Greenvale 2. Convert
its 20% interest to a 1.5% NSR.
Historical Exploration Summary
NTGS databases “Historical Mineral Titles” and “GEMIS” were interrogated to capture past
exploration titles overlapping EL33621 and EL33692, and all relevant reports were
reviewed. Table 1 is a summary of historical titles and results reported. Drillhole locations
are shown in Figure 2.
