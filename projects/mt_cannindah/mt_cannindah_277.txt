Proposal to Conduct Due Diligence
The Board of Cannindah Resources Limited (ASX: CAE) has received a
proposal from Corporacion Naciional del Cobre de Chile ‘Codelco’ (“the

Mt Cannindah project in contemplation of entering into a potential

has executed a ‘consent deed’ detailing the conditions upon which the
Producer will be allowed to access the project and data. The deed gives
consent to the Producer to conduct low impact ground-based

Townsville in the coming weeks. The consent deed does not outline a
potential transaction, nor does it bind the Producer or CAE to enter into
a transaction. Either party may terminate the deed with 5 days’ notice.
The data from this planned exploration activity will be provided to CAE

attracted this continued international interest from a large copper
Producer. We look forward to receiving the benefits of their work as we
