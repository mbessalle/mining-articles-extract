Macro Metals Limited (ASX:M4M) (Macro or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has received
formal notification that its application for exploration licence 45/6365, being its Goldsworthy East
Project, had granted on 6 September 2024.
Immediately upon confirmation of licence grant, the Company lodged its programme of works
(POW) for its Stage 1 drilling programme. The programme is planned to comprise a minimum of
30 Reverse Circulation (RC) drilled holes, spaced 50 metres apart and to an average depth of 200
metres, for a total estimated drilling distance of 6-8,000 metres.
Based upon advice received from the environmental team of DEMIRS responsible for assessing the
POW, the Company expects to receive approval to commence drilling within 10 business days.
The Company’s technical team considered both the location of the recently discovered
surface/subsurface hematite as well as the latest geoscience interpretation of the additional
magnetic survey that the Company conducted in July 2024 when preparing the POW in order to
maximise the likelihood of the Stage 1 drilling programme being successful.
The Company has finalised all logistics planning, including fuel, water and accommodation, for its
Stage 1 drilling. The drilling contractor has been engaged and will mobilise to site during the week
commencing 21 September 2024. Based upon available information, the Company expects to
commence drilling on 25 September 2024.
Additionally, given the recent discovery of outcrop and sub-crop high grade hematite, the Company
will also undertake a third phase of detailed mapping and sampling across the entire project area.
The intention of this field work is to seek to identify additional high grade hematite outcropping
and sub-cropping in additional areas of interest recently identified in the magnetic survey
conducted in July 2024. The results of this project wide sampling and mapping programme will
also assist the Company refine its planning for its Stage 2 drilling programme which is anticipated
to extend into the northern target area.

Managing Director, Mr Simon Rushton said, “The Cook government recently reiterated its
commitment to supporting Western Australia’s mining industry by expediting approvals,
streamlining the approval process and providing incentives to exploration companies and
the department’s handling of our Goldsworthy East project has certainly reflected that
commitment.
I am particularly grateful to the office of the Minister for Mines as well as the heritage and
tenure teams at DEMIRS for accepting the two State Deeds that were executed on behalf
of the Ngarla and Nyamal people and thereafter granting our exploration licence in a quick
order of time.
I wish to congratulate our small but dedicated team for their hard work and commitment
in getting Macro Metals to this pivotal point so quickly. In the past 8 weeks, they have
successfully completed a heritage survey with the Ngarla People, completed a flora and
fauna survey, completed two mapping and sampling campaigns including the exciting
discovery of a high grade hematite outcrop proximal to our Southern Target, prepared our
Stage 1 drilling programme and have now finalised all logistics preparations so we are
ready to commence the first ever drilling of Goldsworthy East later this month. This is a
tremendous achievement and is ahead of schedule by some two months on what was
already an aggressive timeline for the project that was set when the new board were
appointed just six (6) months ago.
I am really looking forward to being on country later this month when we put the first drill
rods down at Goldsworthy East. There is a lot to be excited about as this project has the
potential to be a State significant one given its location is just 1,800 metres along strike from
the old Mt Goldsworthy Iron Ore Project that exported 55Mt of plus 63.5% Fe between 1965
and 1982.

Overview of Goldsworthy East
• The Goldsworthy East project is located:
o adjacent to BHP’s Mining Lease, directly along strike from Mt Goldsworthy which
produced 55Mt at 63.5% Fe between 1965 and 1982.
o less than 100kms from the multi-user, Utah Point Bulk Handling Facility along sealed,
all weather Great Northern Highway.
• High grade hematite float, scree and outcrop/sub-crop have been located in the southern
extent of the tenure. The outcrop/sub-crop is approximately 220 metres wide and runs
along a strike of 450 metres that remains open to the west.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors.

Cautionary Statement
The Company cautions that with respect to any visual mineralisation indicators, visual observations
and estimates of mineral abundance are uncertain in nature and should not be taken as a
substitute or proxy for appropriate laboratory analysis. Visual estimates also potentially provide no
information regarding impurities or deleterious physical properties relevant to valuations. Refer ASX
announcements dated 28 August 2024 for further details of the hematite sample GERK0036 and 18
July 2024 for further details of hematite sample 24GW001. Drill testing will be required to
understand the grade and extent of mineralisation and whether the sample material is
representative of an in-situ target.
