Catalina extends presence at Laverton  
Highlights 
 
• 
Grant of tenement E38/3847, located only 2 km from the 
Burtville Gold Mine.  
• 
Positioned at the northern end of the mineralized 
Burtville-Karridale mine corridor ¹. 
• 
This corridor is host to a very large bulk tonnage gold 
mineralisation system exceeding 1Moz ². 
• 
Historically, 
the new tenement 
area has been 
underexplored.  
➢ Historical limited & shallow, vacuum drilling 
done that was unable to penetrate the 
transported cover. 
➢ Only one RC hole has been drilled with a focus 
on nickel and not assayed for gold. 
 
 
Catalina Resources (“Catalina” or “the Company”) is pleased to 
announce the grant of exploration license E38/3847 following a 
successful ballot outcome for Catalina’s application. This tenement 
is interpreted to occur along strike of the Burtville and Karridale gold 
deposits. The hosting structure to these significant gold deposits is 
the Burtville-Karridale mine corridor (BKMC), which can be seen 
within Figure 1. This interpretation is based upon regional 
aeromagnetic and gravity images of the area.

Considering its proximity to the Burtville deposit, E38/3847 is an underexplored tenement area. The 
historical exploration has not been systematic, and the sporadic and widely spaced drilling has been 
ineffectual. Placer (Granny Smith) P/L undertook two traverses of shallow vacuum drilling in 2000 with 
hole depths not exceeding 10m and not penetrating the blanket of transported overburden ⁴. Crescent 
Gold focused on nickel exploration in 2009 and drilled one RC hole within the area of E38/3847 but 
did not assay for Au ⁵.

E38/3847 is a strategic addition of another tenement to add to Catalina’s existing exploration tenure 
within the highly mineralised Laverton Tectonic zone, Figure 2.

Next Steps. 
For the initial generation of drill targets within E38/3847, geochemical sampling will be conducted 
over the projected strike of the BKMC.
