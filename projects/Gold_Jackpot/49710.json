(&quot;<strong>SURGE</strong>&quot;) Lithium Discovery.</p><p><strong>51 LITHIUM and Carlin-style Gold CLAIMS FILED WITH BLM RENO OFFICE</strong></p><p><strong><u>CAT Lithium Claims</u></strong>: CAT filed 51 new Lithium-target lode claims with the BLM Reno, Nevada office on February 1, 2024, covering 1,053.66 acres (426 hectares). CAT's total property claims package now covers 241 claims comprising 4,979 acres (2,015 hectares). The outline of these claims is shown in red in Figure 1.</p><p>These 51 new claims cover a northern extension of the lithium-bearing tuff sequence (Humboldt Formation of Miocene age) that is being explored by Surge, as well as Grid Battery Metals, Peloton Minerals, Sienna Resources, and Red Mountain Mining. The 51 claims also enclose a significantly large body of the underlying Jarbidge Rhyolite (&quot;<strong>JR</strong>&quot;) that has high Lithium geochemical values and could be a hydrothermal source for lithium. The JR is of a similar Miocene age as the rocks of the McDermitt sequence holding the giant Thacker Pass lithium Mine owned by Lithium Americas, with a published measured and indicated resources of 13.7 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent, at an average ore grade of 2,231 ppm (0.22%) lithium, which is considered to be the world largest known lithium deposit (source: Lithium Americas, October 7, 2021).</p><p>Further sampling of the Jackpot Lithium claims will be done to determine the geochemical surface distribution of lithium present on the CAT claims.</p><p><strong>CAT NEIGHBOUR SURGE BATTERY METALS PUBLISHES MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE</strong></p><p>In a news release published on February 22, Surge announced a NI 43-101 compliant maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (&quot;<strong>MRE</strong>&quot;) that reported the highest-grade lithium clay resource in the USA with 4.7Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (&quot;<strong>LCE</strong>&quot;) grading 2,839 ppm Li at a 1,250ppm cutoff. The MRE includes over 4Mt of LCE grading 3,167 Li PPM at a 2,000 ppm Li cutoff. The Surge news release also stated that they have significant expansion potential of their resource as the MRE only covers a portion of the known footprint of mineralization that has substantial potential for growth.</p><p>As previously reported, CAT's Gold Jackpot property lies less than 1.5 km to the NE of the Surge NNLP and is in the same geologic formation and context as their discovery area and appears to contain similar distinct commodities. This suggests that the GJ project provides CAT shareholders with a unique opportunity to be in the presence of several potential discoveries; namely hydrothermal lithium, Carlin-style gold, porphyry/diatreme copper-gold silver, and a telluride metal system.</p><p>Robert Rosner, CAT's Chairman and CEO, stated; &quot;<i><strong>CAT's team is extremely encouraged by Surge's MRE and our close proximity to the discovery area. This confirms what we have always expected from our own internal evaluation of the area, and the location of our Gold Jackpot property, which was the recent catalyst for the Company staking new claims in the area. The confirmation of a lithium resource by our neighbour is what we have been waiting for to move forward with the next phase of our own exploration plans.&quot; </strong></i>Mr. Rosner went on to say, <i><strong>&quot;Both Carlin Style Gold and Copper-Gold Porphyries are well known deposit environments in Nevada. Historical exploration locally</strong></i> <i><strong>has shown high-grade Gold-Silver-Copper-Tellurium mineralization results up to 16 g/t Gold by Barrick, to 239 g/t Silver, and higher-grade Tellurium mineralization. The region is hydrothermally very active, and with hindsight, our geological team has shown us that it is not abnormal to find a potential for lithium similar to Thacker Pass. It's a huge step forward for our Gold Jackpot project but more importantly for all of our shareholders.</strong></i><strong>&quot;</strong></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/fbd3a41e-2c46-4486-85a5-8d2e328803d4/837290/image.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><p>Figure 1.

Gold mineralization has been found in the carbonate rocks, including one surface chip sample taken by Peloton Minerals that assayed 1.2 grams per tonne (g/t) gold. A study conducted by Warren Thompson for CAT suggests that Carlin-age gold mineralization could possibly be present in this area. A large Copper-Gold rich porphyry/diatreme system could be present at reasonably shallow depths at Stag's Leap, indicated by a large surface copper-gold-tellurium system present over a 1.5 km long by 0.5 km wide area (see press release of September 14, 2023). As a reminder, geochemical anomalies are open to the north and to the south of the target area and an IP survey atop this target by Zonge Geosciences for CAT showed an anomalous zone of high electrical conductivity at a yet undetermined depth.

While the Company was able to announce that it had been successful in staking additional ground around its original claim block and to renew these claims, numerous discussions were undertaken with various parties that had approached CAT and stated their interest in financing the Company and its projects. As a result of these discussions, several corporate changes were undertaken in order to better position the Company as a more attractive investment opportunity. Unfortunately, these discussions were not concluded successfully, mainly due to market conditions. Additionally, the decrease in the price of lithium over the past seven months has significantly impacted CAT's ability to move forward as planned, which resulted in a number of corporate plans and actions to be put on hold. For the past number of months, CAT has been able to maintain the basics of its business while it continues to seek outside investment capital.
