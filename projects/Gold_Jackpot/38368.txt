# CAT Strategic Continues to Increase Land Package at Gold Jackpot; 22 New Claims Staked in Lithium Discovery Area in Elko County, Nevada

  * _**22 New Lode Mining Claims Staked**_
  *  _**2 New Discoveries of Mineralization**_
  *  _**Samples Taken and Hand-Delivered to ALS**_



**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 24, 2023 /** CAT Strategic Metals Corporation (CSE:CAT)(OTC:CATTF)(FRA:8CH) ("**CAT** " or the "**Company** ") is pleased to provide an activity update on its Gold Jackpot Lithium Property located in Elko County, Nevada.

**22 ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS STAKED**

CAT deployed its consulting geologist to the Gold Jackpot property on July 11th to July 16th in order to continue an on-site review of the property and ongoing reconnaissance to determine additional lithium claim staking opportunities. This activity resulted in CAT staking a further twenty-two (22) claims to the east _and south_ west of the Company's existing claim block. **This has increased CAT's landholdings to 155 claims, which now totals 3,202 acres, or 1,296 hectares**. The updated map below shows CATs original claim block in blue and the newly staked claims in red. It also shows CAT's claims in relation to Surge Battery Metals Inc. ("**Surge** ") and Peloton Minerals Corporation ("**Peloton** "), the Company's neighbours in what is considered to be a new and emerging lithium discovery area.

**GOLD JACKPOT NEW LITHIUM AND GOLD-TELLURIUM SAMPLING**

Eleven rock chip samples were taken during the recent mid-July visit to the property. Several samples were collected from tuffaceous sediment units on CAT's new claims that could be host to Lithium mineralization. Two new discoveries of possible epithermal gold mineralization were staked and sampled. Also, four "bulk" samples of high-grade Au-Ag-Te mineralization taken at Stag's Leap in 2009 (Figure 1) were re-taken, to be analyzed by 1 Kg screen-fire gold analyses and by 4-acid dissolution method for tellurium, copper, silver, molybdenum, and other components. The screen-fire analyses will test the samples for larger particles of possible "nugget gold" in the samples. A previous sample was taken at Stag's Leap by Barrick Gold personnel that reportedly assayed 16 grams per tonne Au (Ed Cope, pers. comm. to Redfern). The new CAT samples were submitted to the ALS laboratory in Elko. The results of those samples will be reported when received by the company.

Mr. Richard R. Redfern, M.S., C.P.G. No. 10717, is the qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 who has examined the property on the ground, and wrote a Master's thesis on the Prince Mine area on Peloton's claim block, reviewed the geological information available from public sources related to the property, and is responsible for approving the technical contents of this press release.
