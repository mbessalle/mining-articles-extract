(CSE: HWTN) (\"<b>Hawthorn</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce that on February 20, 2025, it entered into a binding letter agreement (the \"<b>Letter Agreement</b>\") with Stampede Metals Ltd., a private Australian company, (\"<b>Australia Corp</b>\") to acquire  (the \"<b>Acquisition</b>\") its wholly-owned subsidiary, Stampede Metals Corporation, a private Nevada, USA Corporation (\"<b>Nevada Corp</b>\").</p><p>\"We are very excited to acquire Stampede Metals Corporation with its Prince Silver and Stampede Gap porphyry Cu-Mo projects in exchange for shares,\" states President Ralph Shearing, P.Geol. \"The Prince Silver project is a near surface silver-gold-zinc carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) with past production and extensive drilling that is open in all directions.  Hawthorn is eager to initiate a drill program on the Exploration Target, as described below, to advance the project towards the contractual Prince Project Milestone goal of a published NI43-101 Technical Report demonstrating aggregate inferred, measured and indicated resources of minimum of 100 million ounces silver equivalent.\"</p><p>Both the Exploration Target and the Prince Project Milestone are further described below. </p><p>Both Nevada Corp projects are located in southeastern Nevada near the town of Pioche and corresponding mineral claims are either owned directly by Nevada Corp. or held under several option to purchase agreements as described below.</p><p> <b>HISTORIC PRINCE MINE</b></p><p>The Prince Mine historic production between 1912 and 1949 was recorded at 1.12 Mt @ 4.5% Zn, 2.8% Pb, 10.2% Mn, 100g/t Ag, 0.5g/t Au (Gemmill, 1970). Most of this production was from high grade fissure veins with some production from small surface open cuts.  </p><p><b>PRINCE SILVER EXPLORATION PROJECT</b></p><p>To evaluate the mineral potential of the Prince Project, an exploration target (the \"<b>Exploration Target</b>\") was outlined in a 2024 independent report prepared following JORC guidelines <i>(JORC standards for the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves)</i> by OmniGeoX Exploration Consultants of Perth, <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/q8DreTn431\" target=\"_blank\">Australia </a>based on historical surface and underground drilling. The Exploration Target was based on 129 historic drill holes drilled through mineralised carbonate replacement beds and host Pioche Shale up to 500M depth. Mineralized polymetallic intersections based on historical block modelling suggests the immediate Exploration Target is between 25-43Mt with grades ranging as 1.44-1.57% Zn, 0.78-0.87% Pb, 0.003-0.005% Cu, 0.28-0.40g/t Au, 37-40g/t Ag and 3.62-4.30% Mn. The mineralization is open in all directions.</p><p><i><b>Readers are cautioned that the Exploration Target is not an \"inferred\", \"indicated\" or \"measured\" mineral resource compliant with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). The Exploration Target has been determined based upon 129 historic drill holes totalling 16,606 meters, historic production records including mine level plans and 3D modelling of mineralization and geology. The potential quantity and grade of the Exploration Target is conceptual in nature.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the Exploration Target being delineated as a mineral resource.</b></i></p><p>The Company's strategy will be to focus drilling towards establishing an initial NI 43-101 resource estimate amenable to open pit extraction. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the concurrent financing as follows:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li>Verify the historical drilling database for potential inclusion in an updated compliant resource calculation, </li><li>Expand the project resources using modern drilling and surface exploration methods, </li><li>Upgrade the historic internal block model to a maiden NI 43-101 compliant resource,</li><li>Conduct metallurgical testing to determine optimal recovery methods.</li></ol><p><b>STAMPEDE GAP PROJECT.</b></p><p>The Stampede Gap porphyry Cu-Au-Mo project has been barely tested but has already been established as a large Cu-Mo porphyry system. A target model type for this project is the large-scale Ely-Robinson-Ruth porphyry copper-gold deposit with measured and indicated resources of 358Mt@ 0.45% Cu, 0.18g/t Au. (PorterGeo Consultancy December 2014) Stampede Gap project is located approximately 150km south of the Ely-Robinson-Ruth Mine.</p><p><i><b>Readers are cautioned that any comparison to the established Ely-Robinson-Ruth porphyry copper-gold deposit is conceptional in nature and there has been insufficient work to demonstrate that the Stampede Gap property hosts comparable mineralization or would demonstrate comparable feasibility.</b></i></p><p>At Stampede Gap, 19 strong IP target anomalies have been identified and are coincident with magnetic anomalies and extensive alteration at surface. One 700m hole drilled at the Albatross target intersected over 400m of semi-continuous sulphidic skarns containing highly anomalous molybdenum and anomalous copper suggesting the possibility of a major Cu-Mo porphyry centre nearby. This drill hole ended in mineralization due to the drill reaching its maximum depth capability. Subsequent 3D IP inversions geophysical surveying demonstrated that the drilling missed the primary IP target. Stampede Gap contains a wealth of excellent IP drill targets, which warrant further future exploration. </p><p><b>FINANCING </b></p><p>In connection with the Acquisition, Hawthorn will conduct a private placement of subscription receipts for minimum aggregate proceeds of C$3.5 million, up to maximum aggregate proceeds of C$4.0 million at a price of $0.27 per subscription receipt.  In connection with closing of the Acquisition, each subscription receipt will automatically convert into one unit, where each unit will consist of one common share and &#189; of a share purchase warrant with each whole warrant exercisable into one common share at $0.40 per share for a period of eighteen months, provided that if the closing price of the Company's common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"<b>CSE</b>\") is equal to or greater that $0.60 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days, the Company will have the right, for a period of 15  business days, to accelerate the expiry date of the warrants upon notice given by press release and the warrants will thereafter expire on the 30th calendar day after the date of such press release (the \"<b>Initial Private Placement</b>\").

Hawthorn is eager to initiate a drill program on the Exploration Target, as described below, to advance the project towards the contractual Prince Project Milestone goal of a published NI43-101 Technical Report demonstrating aggregate inferred, measured and indicated resources of minimum of 100 million ounces silver equivalent.\" Both the Exploration Target and the Prince Project Milestone are further described below. Both Nevada Corp projects are located in southeastern Nevada near the town of Pioche and corresponding mineral claims are either owned directly by Nevada Corp. or held under several option to purchase agreements as described below. HISTORIC PRINCE MINE The Prince Mine historic production between 1912 and 1949 was recorded at 1.12 Mt @ 4.5% Zn, 2.8% Pb, 10.2% Mn, 100g/t Ag, 0.5g/t Au (Gemmill, 1970). Most of this production was from high grade fissure veins with some production from small surface open cuts. PRINCE SILVER EXPLORATION PROJECT To evaluate the mineral potential of the Prince Project, an exploration target (the \" Exploration Target \") was outlined in a 2024 independent report prepared following JORC guidelines (JORC standards for the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves) by OmniGeoX Exploration Consultants of Perth, Australia based on historical surface and underground drilling. The Exploration Target was based on 129 historic drill holes drilled through mineralised carbonate replacement beds and host Pioche Shale up to 500M depth. Mineralized polymetallic intersections based on historical block modelling suggests the immediate Exploration Target is between 25-43Mt with grades ranging as 1.44-1.57% Zn, 0.78-0.87% Pb, 0.003-0.005% Cu, 0.28-0.40g/t Au, 37-40g/t Ag and 3.62-4.30% Mn. The mineralization is open in all directions. Readers are cautioned that the Exploration Target is not an \"inferred\", \"indicated\" or \"measured\" mineral resource compliant with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). The Exploration Target has been determined based upon 129 historic drill holes totalling 16,606 meters, historic production records including mine level plans and 3D modelling of mineralization and geology. The potential quantity and grade of the Exploration Target is conceptual in nature.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the Exploration Target being delineated as a mineral resource. The Company's strategy will be to focus drilling towards establishing an initial NI 43-101 resource estimate amenable to open pit extraction. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the concurrent financing as follows: Verify the historical drilling database for potential inclusion in an updated compliant resource calculation, Expand the project resources using modern drilling and surface exploration methods, Upgrade the historic internal block model to a maiden NI 43-101 compliant resource, Conduct metallurgical testing to determine optimal recovery methods. STAMPEDE GAP PROJECT. The Stampede Gap porphyry Cu-Au-Mo project has been barely tested but has already been established as a large Cu-Mo porphyry system. A target model type for this project is the large-scale Ely-Robinson-Ruth porphyry copper-gold deposit with measured and indicated resources of 358Mt@ 0.45% Cu, 0.18g/t Au. (PorterGeo Consultancy December 2014) Stampede Gap project is located approximately 150km south of the Ely-Robinson-Ruth Mine. Readers are cautioned that any comparison to the established Ely-Robinson-Ruth porphyry copper-gold deposit is conceptional in nature and there has been insufficient work to demonstrate that the Stampede Gap property hosts comparable mineralization or would demonstrate comparable feasibility. At Stampede Gap, 19 strong IP target anomalies have been identified and are coincident with magnetic anomalies and extensive alteration at surface. One 700m hole drilled at the Albatross target intersected over 400m of semi-continuous sulphidic skarns containing highly anomalous molybdenum and anomalous copper suggesting the possibility of a major Cu-Mo porphyry centre nearby. This drill hole ended in mineralization due to the drill reaching its maximum depth capability. Subsequent 3D IP inversions geophysical surveying demonstrated that the drilling missed the primary IP target. Stampede Gap contains a wealth of excellent IP drill targets, which warrant further future exploration. FINANCING In connection with the Acquisition, Hawthorn will conduct a private placement of subscription receipts for minimum aggregate proceeds of C$3.5 million, up to maximum aggregate proceeds of C$4.0 million at a price of $0.27 per subscription receipt.  In connection with closing of the Acquisition, each subscription receipt will automatically convert into one unit, where each unit will consist of one common share and ½ of a share purchase warrant with each whole warrant exercisable into one common share at $0.40 per share for a period of eighteen months, provided that if the closing price of the Company's common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \" CSE \") is equal to or greater that $0.60 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days, the Company will have the right, for a period of 15  business days, to accelerate the expiry date of the warrants upon notice given by press release and the warrants will thereafter expire on the 30th calendar day after the date of such press release (the \" Initial Private Placement \").  Finders' fees may be payable to certain arm's length parties in connection with the closing of the Initial Private Placement. Transaction Terms Hawthorn has agreed to acquire 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Corp. from the shareholders of Australia Corp under the following terms: Consolidation: Hawthorn will conduct a share consolidation of all its issued and outstanding share capital at a ratio of 0.75 new shares to 1 existing share, such that Hawthorn will have 15,795,000 common shares outstanding post consolidation. Consideration Shares: In consideration of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Nevada Corp, Hawthorn will issue 15 million common shares (the \" Consideration Shares \") to the benefit of Australia Corp shareholders at a deemed price of $0.27 per Consideration Share.  The Consideration Shares will be subject to voluntary restricting re-sale for a period of one year from the date (the \" Closing Date \") of the closing of the Acquisition (the \" Closing \"). Prince Project Milestone Shares: Hawthorn will allot an additional 8.5 million shares (the \" Prince Milestone Shares \") to Australia Corp shareholders to be issued upon the publication of a NI 43-101 technical report for the Prince Silver project demonstrating aggregate inferred, measured and indicated resources containing a minimum of 100 million ounces of silver equivalent (the \" Prince Project Milestone \").  Should the Prince Project Milestone not be achieved within four years from the Closing Date, the allotment will expire. Hawthorn will have the option to accelerate the issuance of Prince Milestone Shares within one year of the Closing Date by issuing instead 6.8 million common shares to the Australia Corp Shareholders, representing a 20% reduction to the 8.5 million Prince Milestone Shares. Appointments: In connection with Closing, Hawthorn will: (i) appoint Robert Wrixon as a director of Hawthorn; and (ii) appoint Harrison Matson as consultant geologist for the Project. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company intends to issue an aggregate of 370,000 common shares as finder's shares, at a deemed price of $0.27 per share to an arm's length party. The final structure of the Transaction will be determined by the parties, based upon tax, securities and corporate law considerations, and will be governed by the terms of a definitive agreement governing the Transaction (the \"Definitive Agreement\") containing warranties, covenants, conditions, and agreements customary for transactions of the nature and magnitude of the Acquisition. If the Definitive Agreement is not executed by May 31, 2025, the Letter Agreement will terminate. Completion of the proposed Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, negotiation of a Definitive Agreement,  completion by parties of satisfactory due diligence, finalization of the terms of the Initial Private Placement, satisfaction by the parties of all applicable filing requirements pursuant to the policies of the CSE, and acceptance and receipt of all applicable regulatory, corporate and shareholder approvals, including the approval of the CSE. In accordance with CSE policies the Company will be seeking shareholder approval for the issuance of the aggregate common shares to be issued pursuant to the Acquisition and the Initial Private Placement. The Company intends to provide a further comprehensive news release providing further details of the proposed Acquisition, including the terms of any finder's fees payable in connection with the Initial Private Placement and upon the parties entering the Definitive Agreement.
