Critical Resources to Acquire the Amoco Antimony-Gold 
Project in NSW & Successful Placement to Raise $3 million 
 
 
Critical minerals exploration and project development company Critical Resources Limited 
ASX:CRR (“Critical Resources”, “CRR” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce a strategic 
acquisition of 100% of the Amoco Project (EL9293) in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, 
Australia.  
 
Highlights 
• 
CRR agrees to acquire 100% interest in the Amoco Antimony-Gold Project (EL9293), 
located adjacent to the Company’s existing Hillgrove South (Mayview Antimony-Gold 
prospect) and Halls Peak Projects, and 17km southeast of Larvotto Resources’ (ASX:LRV) 
Hillgrove Antimony-Gold operations, the largest known antimony deposit in Australia. 
• 
The Amoco project hosts highly anomalous rock chip and soil samples, over a length of 
over 1,000 meters from east to west, with elevated gold mineralisation at 17.9g/t, 12.9 
g/t and 10.4 g/t, antimony at 0.53% and silver at 80g/t. 
• 
The acquisition will cement the Company’s position as the largest landholder in the 
Hillgrove-Halls Peak region (981km2), with significant data indicating the area has the 
potential to host deposits analogous to the Hillgrove-style antimony-gold system.    
• 
The Amoco project compliments CRR’s existing strategic portfolio at Halls Peak that 
already includes the Mayview Homestead Antimony Prospect containing rock chip 
grades up to 1.55% Sb, situated only ~2.7km east of LRV’s Hillgrove Gold-Antimony 
Project. 
• 
Heavily subscribed capital raising with firm commitments for $3 million at an issue price 
of $0.0062 per share, with 1 for 2 free attaching options exercisable at $0.015 with a 3 
year expiry date. 
• 
Funds to advance activities at Halls Peak Project (including newly identified Mayview 
Target and Amoco Antimony Projects), drilling activities targeting the Northern 
Prospects and the Eastern zone of the Mavis Lake Main Project and working capital. 
• 
Board to participate $150k in the placement, subject to shareholder approval. 
• 
Local expert geological consultants have been appointed to expedite fieldwork across 
CRR’s known antimony prospects, with the data collected used to design a maiden 
drilling campaign. 
• 
China’s recent restrictive export policy on Antimony places further strategic importance 
on the Hillgrove South (Mayview Antimony-Gold) project, the Amoco Antimony-Gold 
project and the broader Halls Peak Project areas.

Antimony and gold assays and a plethora of structural features confirm the potential for a 
discovery of a Hillgrove-style Antimony-Gold system within the greater Halls Peak area. 
 
About the Amoco Antimony-Gold Project (“Amoco”) 
 
The Amoco Antimony-Gold grid (“Amoco”) covers an area of approximately 1.7km2 in size and is 
located within exploration licence EL9293. The licence is situated between and contiguous to the 
Company’s interest in existing Halls Peak Project licences.  
 
Amoco is located approximately 17km southeast of Larvotto Resources Ltd’s (ASX:LRV) Hillgrove 
Antimony-Gold operations, which is reported to host the largest known antimony deposit in 
Australia.  
 
The strategic addition of this Project further strengthens the Company’s dominant land interest 
position in the region (Figures 1, 2 & 10) with existing interests in the Hall Peak Project granted 
Exploration Licences (EL4474, EL7679, EL9428, EL9429, EL9430) encompassing at total of 946km2. The 
addition of the Amoco Anomaly further expands the Company’s Antimony-Gold prospects with 
several antimony prospects that have never been explored with modern exploration techniques 
being identified in recent desktop studies, in addition to the Gibson Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au polymetallic 
Mineral Resources estimate (“MRE”).  
 
Recent desktop review of MRE drilling on EL4474 by Critical Resources and from previous owners 
intersected elevated antimony assays within the Gibson prospect area within the Halls Peak 
Project. While drilling was primarily focused on intersecting the known base metals, 2 holes, DDHA6 
and CRR21DD_01, intersected significant Antimony (Sb) values within faulted arsenopyrite bearing 
fault structures, as shown in Table 1, which provides evidence of the Halls Peak project area being 
part of a larger Antimony-Gold system.

Valuable Data Base to Expedite Drill Target Definition 
 
Amoco comes with an extensive and valuable exploration database that will help fast track 
ground exploration to expedite drill target definition. This includes hundreds of soil samples and 
numerous rock chip assays.  
 
In 2012, Precious Metal Resources Ltd (ASX:PMR) conducted a closed-spaced Heliborne VTEM and 
Magnetic Survey*9 that covered all of the Amoco project and CRR’s adjoining EL4474. This high-
resolution magnetic data has never been interpreted for the Antimony-Gold hosting structures that 
will be readily identifiable through processing of the magnetic survey data. This presents a valuable 
opportunity and CRR will be engaging a specialist consultant geophysicist to use advanced 
propriety software filters to locate and map the Antimony-Gold structures, with the aim of testing 
predicted extensions of the structural controls of the large scale of system and define areas of 
potential new mineralisation.  
 
Geochemical surveys, rock chip sampling, petrographic studies and mapping*2-*5, *7-*15, *17-*27 have 
defined multiple diagnostic characteristics that confirm a large Hillgrove-style Antimony-Gold 
system is potentially present in the Amoco project and CRR’s adjoining EL4474.

workstream are anticipated to be completed in Q4 2024, with first results Q1 2025.  
 
Mr Michael Leu acted as a competent person for the Company and states that the information in 
this announcement is an accurate representation of the available data and studies for the Amoco 
Project. 
 
History of the Amoco Grid Antimony-Gold Discovery 
 
The vast amount of exploration conducted around Halls Peak has been focused on volcanic-
hosted massive sulphide deposits. Amoco Minerals Australia Co., in the early 1980s, appears to be 
the only company that conducted systematic exploration for gold (Gardiner, G., 1983. Final 
Report, Halls Peak, Exploration Licences 1427 and 1742, New South Wales, Amoco Minerals 
Australia Co., GS1983/360 R00014317)*3. Amoco Minerals Australia discovered a large gold and 
antimony anomaly (the “Amoco Grid Anomaly”) (Figures 5 and 6) however due to market 
conditions the target was never tested at the time. Amoco Minerals Australia rarely assayed for 
antimony but recorded some assays of up to 0.17% antimony (Sb) in rock chips taken on EL9293 
(Table 2). The Amoco Grid*2, *3 encompasses portions of both EL9293 and EL4474 (Figures 2, 5 and 
6).  
 
Amoco Minerals Australia gridded an area of approximately 1.7km2 (Figures 5 and 6). This grid had 
lines spaced 100 metres apart and staked at 25 metre intervals. Soil samples were taken at 25 
metre intervals along the lines. 
 
The Amoco Grid Discovery included an exceptionally high-grade Gold-in-soil anomalies, 31 soil 
samples (Table 3) ranging up to 1.8g/t Gold (Au) (most Gold-in-soil anomalies are reported in parts 
per billion (ppb))*2, *3. Amoco Minerals Australia’s geologists duplicated many samples, and assays 
by two different labs confirmed the same tenor of gold grade*2. This provides an exciting 
opportunity to further explore a significant gold opportunity.  
 
Two rock chip samples were taken by Amoco Minerals Australia’s geologists from the area of 
anomalous gold geochemistry, each representing 5 metres to 10 metres diameter of outcrop 
contained significant gold assays of up to 1.1g/t. These samples were taken from near 3000n:7650E 
(Amoco Grid coordinate) where previous rock chip samples assayed up to 5.2g/t Au. *3 
 
The Amoco Grid has high-grade Gold and Antimony mineralisation at grass roots: Rock chip 
samples up to 17.9g/t Gold (Au)*4, 0.53% Antimony (Sb)*5 and 80g/t Silver*3 (Table 2). 
 
This significant gold and antimony discovery lay forgotten in the literature until 1996 when 
consultant geologist Michael Leu commenced systematic exploration to understand the source 
of the Amoco Grid mineralisation*8, *19-*27 on the Amoco project. Multielement assays and 
petrographic studies of samples collected by Mr Leu confirmed a strong association of antimony, 
gold and silver (Table 2). This exploration works conducted over 1996 to 2024 progressively led to 
the discovery and identification of a large-scale orogenic Gold-Antimony fault vein, quartz 
stockwork-breccia-type system. This system is similar to the multimillion ounce gold deposits of the 
Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Project (NSW), the Victorian Goldfields (e.g. Stawell and Fosterville), and 
the Hodgkinson Goldfield (Far North Queensland). 
 
   
Page 6 of 29 
 
Vein systems associated with these styles of Antimony-Gold systems can be present in multiple, 
close-spaced faults hundreds of metres long, with extensive vertical continuity of hundreds of 
metres to kilometres.  
 
The under explored Amoco Antimony-Gold Anomaly Discovery has significant potential as 
evidenced by the Larvotto Resources’ Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Project (Total JORC 2012 Mineral 
Resources Ore Reserve Estimate: 3.154Mt @ 3.2g/t Au & 1.2% Sb for a total of 320,000 ounces of 
Gold and 39,000 tonnes of Stibnite; Total JORC 2012 Mineral Resources: 7.264Mt @ 4.4g/t Au & 1.3% 
Sb, for a total of 1,036,000 ounces of Gold and 93,000 tonnes of Stibnite (refer Larvotto Resources 
ASX release of 10 September 2024*6). 
 
With both Antimony and Gold at record prices, the Company will expediate exploration field 
works, which will help delineate maiden drilling programs to finally unlock the potential of the asset. 
The Company will continue to utilise the extensive datasets that support the potential of the dual 
Antimony-Gold and Massive Sulphide drill targets at the Amoco project and the broader Halls Peak 
area.  
 
The Amoco Anomaly antimony-gold system has a topographic setting analogous to that of the 
Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Mine when mining started in 1878, i.e. at grass roots. Significant potential, 
with high-grade gold and antimony mineralisation located over 1km at surface, and multiple 
mineralised structures.

The Hillgrove and Amoco Orogenic Deposits Share Multiple Diagnostic Features.

The strategic addition of the Amoco project to the Company’s Halls Peak portfolio interest, adds 
significant exploration potential to the Company’s dominant tenure portfolio, further adding to the 
numerous antimony prospects recently identified and which a number of have never been 
explored with modern exploration techniques. 
 
The Company’s Hillgrove South Mayview Antimony prospect is part of the considerable Halls Peak 
Project’s tenement footprint located south-east of Armidale, New South Wales, in the highly 
prospective New England Fold Belt, which also hosts LRV’s Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project.  
 
Mayview Homestead Antimony Prospect   
 
CRR’s South Hillgrove Prospect (EL9428), which is part of the boarder Halls Peak Project is 
contiguous to the southern and southeastern boundaries of LRV’s Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project, 
and contains the Mayview Homestead Antimony Prospect (Figures 3 and 8).  
 
Mayview Homestead Stibnite prospect grading 1.55% Sb, is situated ~2.7km east of LRV’s Hillgrove 
Antimony-Gold Project. It is potentially a continuation of Australia’s largest Antimony-Gold System, 
occupying a southeast trending fault or shear zone, similar to many lodes at LRV’s nearby large 
Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project. CRR’s expert geologist will be sampling and mapping the 
Mayview Homestead Prospect as part of the Company’s recent announced fieldworks programs. 
 
 
Figure 6: CRR’s Mayview Homestead Antimony Prospect directly adjacent to the LRV Hillgrove Operations  
 
The records of the Geological Survey of New South Wales (GSNSW) document massive stibnite 
(Sb₂S₃) at the Mayview Homestead Antimony Prospect*29. The GSNSW mapped historical 
underground workings, shafts and adits with one working 100m long and 5m wide. The antimony 
mineralisation occupies a fault or shear zone, similar to the dominant stibnite ore structures at the 
adjacent LRV Hillgrove Antimony-Gold Project. The structures at the Hillgrove Project have been 
proven to extend laterally and vertically for hundreds of metres. An assay sample collected by the 
GSNSW about a shaft consisted of quartz veins in mudstone and assayed 1.55% Sb and 0.13ppm 
Au. Further work is required to determine if the Mayview Homestead antimony mineralisation is 
potentially a continuation of the Hillgrove Project orogenic Antimony-Gold system. 
 
 
 
   
Page 10 of 29 
 
CRR’s Halls Peak Broader Antimony Prospects  
 
CRR’s EL9430 contains a further two antimony prospects (Figure 1). The Riverview and Kempsey 
Road Antimony Prospects were recorded by the Geological Survey of NSW in the early 1980’s*29. 
The Riverview Prospect consists of adits and underground workings developed on multiple 
(stockwork or sheeted) antimony veins developed in granodiorite and is recorded as an intrusion-
related system that could potentially be large scale. Both the Riverview and Kempsey Road 
Antimony Prospects are accessible from the Kempsey Road.  
 
Orogenic Antimony-Gold Veins West of Gibsons Prospect.  
 
Further Confirmation Potential Large Scale, Late Stage System Superimposed on Volcanogenic 
Massive Sulphides 
 
In addition to the elevated antimony drilling assays within the Gibson prospect Area within the Halls 
Peak Project (noted above), rock chip samples, taken from multiple locations in along the regional 
scale mapped fault zones, suggest that antimony mineralisation is widespread and not limited to 
isolated pockets*26. The presence of antimony at surface provides a strong indication of potential 
for substantial subsurface mineralisation (refer CRR ASX announcement 3 October 2024). 
 
This further supports the potential for the Amoco Orogenic Antimony-Gold System to be, like the 
Hillgrove System, hosted in very extensive structures that are potentially continuous from the 
Amoco Antimony-Gold Grid. Sample RC1’s elevation is 674m (AHD, Australian Height Datum) in 
contrast to location 3000n 3000E (Amoco Grid) at 934m, a difference in elevation of 260m. This 
possibly indicates deep tapping structures, another predictable diagnostic feature of Hillgrove-
style Antimony-Gold orogenic systems. Short term planned exploration will focus on intensive 
sampling and mapping within the broader Halls Peak Project to trace and test potential large scale 
orogenic fault feeder structures. Figure 2 shows three large growth faults that are continuous 
through EL9293 and EL4474 and antimony-gold mineralisation has been confirmed in the large 
Khans Creek Fault.

Next-Steps 
 
CRR’s management has engaged geological consultants including Mr Leu to expedite data 
processing, ground mapping and sampling surveys across its many antimony-gold prospects within 
its greater Halls Peak Project with a view to delineate and designing future drilling campaigns. 
Additionally, the Company will be engaging a specialist consultant geophysicist to use advanced 
propriety software filters in its reinterpretation of closed-spaced heliborne VTEM and magnetic 
survey to locate and map the Antimony-Gold structures, with the aim of testing predicted 
extensions of the structural controls of the large scale of system and define areas of potential new 
mineralisation.  
 
Critical Resources’ Chairman, Robert Martin, commented;  
 
“We are excited to have the opportunity to add such highly prospective ground to our broader 
Halls Peak Project area which now sits at over ~981km2. The consolidation of this highly prospective 
ground package allows us to start fieldwork campaigns to identify and delineate high priority drill 
targets on ground that has never been explored with modern exploration techniques. 
 
CRR has a proven record of fast-tracking exploration and aggressive drilling with the objective of 
defining major resources, to be able to do this in what is potentially a repetition of a Hillgrove-
style Gold Antimony system is something the Company is looking forward to”. 
 
Halls Peak Resource Overview  
 
The Company’s Hall Peak maiden Inferred Mineral Resource of 884,000t grading 3.7% zinc, 1.5% 
lead, 0.4% Copper, 30ppm Silver and 0.1ppm Gold has been estimated, modelling has shown that 
mineralisation is still open along strike to the east/north-east and west/south-west, providing 
immediate potential to increase the MRE with follow-up drilling.

APPENDIX A 
The Tenor of Amoco Gold-Antimony Discovery is Supported by Multiple Coincident Data Sets: 
Studies of the structural, temporal, petrological, geochemical, geophysical and mineralogical controls 
confirm a large orogenic Gold-Antimony system that has many of the diagnostic characteristics of the key 
Australian Orogenic Gold Provinces that host the multimillion ounce gold deposits of the Victorian Goldfields 
(e.g. Stawell and Fosterville), the Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Project (NSW) and the Hodgkinson Goldfield (Far 
North Queensland). These types of gold systems can comprise fault vein arrays that can have a vertical 
extent of 1-2km. 
Structural and Tectonic Data Confirm Large Orogenic Fault Vein Au-Sb Mineralisation 
The Amoco Gold-Antimony Discovery has the key diagnostic Orogenic gold characteristics defined Groves 
et al (1998*16) 
• 
Structurally-controlled deposits developed during the latest stages of an orogenic event in 
metamorphic terrain 
• 
The structural, mineralogical and alteration evidence confirm orogenic gold-antimony mineralisation 
within large scale growth fault structures that channelled the gold mineralisation. The major fault zones 
(fluid conduits) exhibit more than one growth period. 
• 
The Gold-Antimony system potentially formed during deformational processes at a convergent plate 
margin modified by rifting 
Petrographic Studies Confirm Orogenic Fault Vein Gold-Antimony System (Petrographic Reports*16, *17, *18) 
Samples collected over hundreds of metres confirm a plethora of diagnostic characteristics 
Mineralisation 
Suite: 
Gold-quartz-arsenopyrites-pyrite-stibnite-chalcopyrites-galena-sphalerite-rare 
tennantite-tetrahedrite. Diagnostic minerals common to the key Australian Orogenic Gold-Antimony 
Provinces that host the multimillion ounce gold deposits of the Victorian Goldfields (e.g. Stawell and 
Fosterville), the Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Project (NSW) and the Hodgkinson Goldfield (Far North 
Queensland). 
*16 Petrographic Report on Nine Rock Samples from the Barraba Area, Northern NSW, and North and Central 
Queensland, Ashley, P.M. August 2024 states “Two samples from the original Amoco grid in the Halls Peak 
area: Quartz textures in the apparent hydrothermal infill in both samples are consistent with development in 
a “shallow mesothermal” environment, with imposed deformation features inferring possible syn-tectonic 
emplacement. 
The geochemical characteristics of these two samples, with high values of Au, As and Sb, and relatively low 
base metals (and Ag), together with mineralogy and quartz textures, are considered to be consistent with 
an orogenic gold mineralised system. These characteristics contrast significantly with the geological and 
geochemical setting of the Halls Peak massive sulphide system to the west, and provide some analogy with 
the Hillgrove Au-Sb-As-W deposit."  
Petrographic Studies have Confirmed Multiple Characteristics Diagnostic of an Orogenic Fault Vein Gold-
Antimony System – some of these are as follows: 
*17. England, R.N., 2003, Petrographic Notes for 9 Samples from the Hall’s Peak Area, Southern New England 
Fold Belt 
*18. England, R.N., 2004, Petrographic Notes for 17 Samples from the Hall’s Peak Area. 
• 
The variation in fluid-inclusion density suggests boiling or phase separation 
• 
Kfeldspar alteration, quartz-adularia stockwork veinlets, colloform-crustiform quartz veins indicate low 
sulphidation, Epizonal 
• 
Large fluid inclusions, the timing of overlap between the stylolites, veins and early cleavage, cataclasis 
cleavage development 
• 
The large size of the fluid inclusions in some coarse veins is more typical of mesothermal conditions 
• 
Formed in a low-T, high-strain environment similar to that in the Hodgkinson and Victorian Gold Fields 
• 
Brittle-ductile deformation in the large growth faults (Khans Creek Fault is several kilometres long) 
   
Page 15 of 29 
 
• 
Fairly coarse grained (<1.5-mm) quartz with undulose extinction and sutured grain boundaries (stress), 
cockade to comb and fibre textures, some quartz veins disrupted and/or stretched into quartz pods; 
in places parallel weakly lenticular vein fragments; are all typical of veins which grew during brittle-
ductile deformation. Demonstrates a low sulphidation environment, all typical of orogenic gold 
occurrences. 
• 
Crack and Seal style, multiple quartz vein events, breccias (crackle, clast and matrix supported), two 
foliations 
The Hillgrove and Amoco Orogenic Systems Share and are Both Characterised By: 
• 
The gold-antimony mineralisation is structurally controlled in multiple steeply dipping vein/shear 
systems 
• 
The deposits exhibit various styles of hydrothermal activity, with veining ranging from simple single veins 
through parallel stringers to quartz stockwork and wall rock breccias 
• 
Petrographic studies confirm the Amoco Gold-Antimony System shares many characteristics of the 
Hillgrove Gold-Antimony Mine where the shear system has been subject to multiple hydrothermal fluid 
events and structural reactivation. 
• 
An initial phase of pervasive sericite-silica alteration is overprinted with a broader ductile event 
consistent with the gold-quartz-arsenopyrite-pyrite phase 
A Selection of Gold-Antimony Mineralised Samples from the Amoco Grid Area 
 
Sample S671*5, 12.9ppm Gold (Au), 0.53% 
Antimony (Sb) and 18.5ppm Silver (Ag). Vein 
composed of brecciated quartz-arsenopyrite 
(scorodite)-quartz-brecciated metasediments 
(protolith siltstone); Sample: floater, (from EL5339 
now EL9293) (Ruler: cm). Sample collected by M. 
Leu around coordinate 3000N 7700-7600E based 
on Amoco’s grid. Results reported in Certificate of 
Analyses BR12233601 – finalised 25 10 2012. 
 
 
Sample AG(1) *4 (Petrographic sample HP6), 
17.9ppm Gold (Au) and 6.2ppm Silver (Ag), not 
assayed for Antimony.  Breccia-vein material of 
quartz-arsenopyrite 
(scoroditised)-pyrite-very minor chalcopyrites); 
Sample: 20cm block broken off large embedded 
boulder, possibly outcrop, (from EL5339 now EL9293) 
(cm scale bar drawn on specimen). Sample 
collected by M. Leu around coordinate 3000N 
7393.5E based on Amoco’s grid. Results reported in 
ALS Certificate of Analyses ST37207 – 2003.

(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g., cut 
channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate 
to the minerals under investigation, such as down 
hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, 
etc.). These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure 
sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems 
used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that 
are Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been 
done this would be relatively simple (e.g., ‘reverse 
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples 
from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g 
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more 
explanation may be required, such as where there 
is coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation 
types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant 
disclosure of detailed information. 
• 
No new field work has been undertaken by the 
Company. The announcement contains a review 
of available exploration data comprising soil and 
rock chip samples, detailed in Criterion: Quality of 
assay data and laboratory tests listed in 
Exploration done by other parties. 
• 
The information contained in this announcement is 
considered to be suitable for determining future 
drilling targets but will not be suitable for 
supporting the disclosure of a mineral resource 
estimate.  
Drilling 
techniques 
• 
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole 
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, 
etc.) and details (eg core diameter, triple or 
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is 
oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
• 
Not applicable, soil and rock chip sampling 
program 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip 
sample recoveries and results assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and 
ensure representative nature of the samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain 
of fine/coarse material. 
• 
Not applicable, rock sampling program 
 
• 
N/A, rock sampling program 
 
 
• 
N/A, rock sampling program 
Logging 
• 
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level 
of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource 
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical 
studies. 
• 
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in 
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) 
photography. 
• 
The total length and percentage of the relevant 
intersections logged. 
 
• 
N/A, no drill hole data, reporting Data comprising 
soil and rock chip samples. 
 
 
• 
Not applicable, rock sampling program 
 
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 
• 
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, 
half or all core taken. 
• 
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary 
split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry. 
• 
For all sample types, the nature, quality and 
appropriateness of the sample preparation 
technique. 
• 
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-
sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
samples. 
• 
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is 
representative of the in situ material collected, 
including for instance results for field 
duplicate/second-half sampling. 
• 
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain

Information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the 
understanding of the exploration results including 
a tabulation of the following information for all 
Material drill holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation 
above sea level in metres) of the drill hole 
collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down hole length and interception depth 
o 
hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the 
basis that the information is not Material and this 
exclusion does not detract from the 
understanding of the report, the Competent 
Person should clearly explain why this is the case. 
• 
N/A, no drilling undertaken or reported.

Data 
aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting 
averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high 
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material 
and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short 
lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of 
low grade results, the procedure used for such 
aggregation should be stated and some typical 
examples of such aggregations should be shown 
in detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal 
equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
• 
No weighting of averaging techniques has been 
utilized.  
 
• 
No aggregations are reported.  
 
 
• 
No metal equivalents were used or calculated. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in 
the reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect 
to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should 
be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths

are reported, there should be a clear statement 
to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width 
not known’). 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and 
tabulations of intercepts should be included for 
any significant discovery being reported These 
should include, but not be limited to a plan view 
of drill hole collar locations and appropriate 
sectional views. 
• 
Pertinent maps for this stage of Project are 
included in the release.  
• 
Coordinates in MGA94  
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration 
Results is not practicable, representative reporting 
of both low and high grades and/or widths should 
be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of 
Exploration Results. 
• 
Results for single known historical rock samples 
reported in the release.  
• 
All results described in this announcement have 
been reported. 
Other 
substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and 
material, should be reported including (but not 
limited to): geological observations; geophysical 
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk 
samples – size and method of treatment; 
metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
groundwater, geotechnical and rock 
characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
 
• 
Historical exploration data  
• 
A desktop geophysical review is underway to 
delineate target areas for field investigation. The 
review is assessing previous work carried out.  
 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg 
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or 
large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible 
extensions, including the main geological 
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided 
this information is not commercially sensitive. 
 
• 
All historical exploration data is being reviewed 
and compiled into a central data base. 
• 
Field crews will be mobilised to site to commence 
orientation field reconnaissance and rock chip 
and soil geochemical sampling.
