Flynn Secures Strategic Addition to 
its Gold Portfolio in NE Tasmania with 
EL Application at Beaconsfield  
Highlights 
• New FG1 Exploration Licence Application (EL13/2024) 
submitted over 40km2 of highly prospective exploration tenure  
surrounding the Beaconsfield Gold Mine lease in NE Tasmania  
• Beaconsfield is the largest gold mine in NE Tasmania with 
historical production of 3.79Mt @ 14.5g/t Au for 1.77Moz Au1 
• EL13/2024 covers brownfields targets with several known gold 
occurrences outside of the Mining Lease offering excellent 
discovery potential using modern exploration techniques 
• Securing EL13/2024 aligns with Flynn’s strategy of targeting 
orogenic gold in NE Tasmania which is recognised as an 
extension of the prolific Victorian gold belts 
• Once EL13/2024 is granted, data compilation and reconnaissance 
exploration programs will commence to identify priority targets 
• Concurrently, Flynn has reduced by 30% (457km2) its existing 
land-holdings in NE Tasmania as its exploration activities focus on 
higher priority areas based on recent results

Investor Hub at https://investorhub.flynngold.com.au/link/8r6A0e 
 
Flynn Gold Limited (ASX: FG1, “Flynn” or “the Company”) is 
pleased to advise that it has submitted an Exploration Licence 
Application (EL13/2024) strategically located surrounding the 
historical Beaconsfield Gold Mine, located approximately 35km north-
west of Launceston in North-East Tasmania (see Figure 1).  
The 40km2 Exploration Licence Application surrounds the privately 
held Mining Lease over the high-grade Beaconsfield Gold Mine and 
covers a prospective 12km corridor along the Cabbage Tree thrust 
block that contains numerous historic gold workings and prospects.

Flynn Gold Managing Director & CEO Neil Marston said: 
“This is an important strategic addition to our extensive portfolio of high-quality gold 
exploration tenure in North-East Tasmania. The new Exploration Licence Application 
encompasses highly prospective ground covering the strike extensions to the 
Beaconsfield Gold Mine host sequence. This was the largest gold mine in North-East 
Tasmania with historical production of about 1.8 million ounces of gold when 
underground mining operations ceased at Beaconsfield in 2012. 
“The acquisition complements our strategic focus on exploring for high-grade gold in 
North-East Tasmania, a recognized extension of the prolific Victorian goldfields. 
“While the Mining Lease is excluded from our application, we believe there is 
significant potential for fresh gold discoveries to be made within the licence application 
area. Once the Exploration Licence is granted, we’ll compile and evaluate the historical 
information to generate targets before commencing field activities.”

About the Beaconsfield-Salisbury Goldfield 
Alluvial gold was first discovered in the Beaconsfield-Salisbury area in 1869 and, in 
1877, the cap of the Tasmania Reef (now known as the Beaconsfield Gold Mine) was 
discovered outcropping on Cabbage Tree Hill.  
Gold production commenced almost immediately, and the mine operated continuously 
until 1914. The mine was reopened in more recent times, operating between 1999 and 
2012, with the gold processing plant still largely intact within the Mining Lease. The 
historical production of 3.785Mt @ 14.51g/t Au (1,774koz Au) makes Beaconsfield 
the largest gold mine in NE Tasmania.

The Tasmania Reef at the Beaconsfield Gold Mine is a Devonian aged structurally-
controlled orogenic gold style quartz reef similar in type to gold deposits hosted in the 
Victorian orogenic belts. The reef is hosted by sediments located in the Cabbage Tree 
thrust block which is bound by the underlying and overlying Cabbage Tree and 
Cobblestone Creek Thrusts respectively (see Figure 2).   
Concurrent with the early development of the Beaconsfield Gold Mine, several other 
small-scale mining and prospecting activities were undertaken throughout the wider 
goldfield, many of which are within Flynn’s licence application area, with upwards of 
70 historical small-scale mines and prospects recorded over a 10km strike length. 
Most of these prospects are located within the same geological host rocks as the 
Beaconsfield deposit. Previous exploration outside of the Beaconsfield Gold Mine area 
was limited and many targets within Flynn’s Exploration Licence area remain poorly 
tested using modern techniques.  
Next Steps 
Following successful granting of the Exploration Licence, the Company will undertake 
data compilation and reconnaissance exploration programs to identify priority targets 
for follow-up exploration activities. The Company looks forward to providing updates 
as the initial work progresses. 
NE Tasmania – Tenement Surrenders 
Concurrent with its application for EL13/2024 at Beaconsfield, the Company has 
reviewed its existing land tenure position in NE Tasmania.  
As a result, the surrender of EL18/2018 (Telegraph) and partial surrenders of 
EL18/2016 (Cameron Tin), EL4/2020 (Lyndhurst) and EL3/2020 (Lisle) have recently 
occurred, reducing the Company’s overall land-holding by 457km2 to approximately 
1,020km2 (see Figure 1). 
This 30% reduction in area will enable the Company to focus its exploration efforts and 
expenditure on the most prospective areas, guided by recent exploration results. The 
surrenders also reduce holding costs with annual rent and minimum annual 
expenditure commitments significantly reduced. 
 
Approved by the Board of Flynn Gold Limited.
