Golden Horse's Managing Director & CEO Nicholas Anderson commented:
"We are excited to enter into the Sale Agreement with Torque Metals, which will significantly
expand our footprint in the highly prospective Yilgarn Mineral Field. The acquisition of the Bullfinch
Gold Project will add 422km² of tenure adjacent to our existing holdings and enhances our
exploration potential as it includes the high-grade Withers prospect which has recorded grades of
35.7 g/t gold.
We look forward to leveraging our expertise and the existing geological data to advance exploration
at Bullfinch, with the goal of unlocking its full potential. This acquisition strengthens Golden Horse's
presence in the Yilgarn Mineral Field, and we are eager to commence further exploration to build on
the promising results already identified."
Bullfinch Overview
The Bullfinch project (see Figure 1) is located on Archaean greenstone lithologies prospective for
gold deposits, massive sulphide nickel-copper deposits, iron ore and lithium. Three historic workings -
Withers, Reynolds Find and Rutherford Find - are the most advanced exploration prospects on the
tenure and all warrant follow up exploration4 .

Withers
The Withers prospect, which lies 6km WNW of the historic Copperhead mine site, consists of over
three kilometres of historical workings and has recorded past production of 1,472 tonnes of ore at a
recovered grade of 35.7 g/t (1,688 ounces).
Results from grab-sampling undertaken by Torque Metals suggested probable high-grade gold
structures in some of the already identified geophysical anomalies. These gold results indicate
significant potential for additional gold discoveries. Significant results of the grab-sampling are as
follows with locations shown in Figure 2:
(TMGS10001) - grab sample (Old workings) 16 g/t Au;
(TMGS10011) - grab sample (Old workings) 2.05 g/t Au; and
(TMGS10016) - grab sample (Mafic sequence outcrop) 9.79 g/t Au.

Rutherfords Find
The Rutherfords Find prospect has had limited exploration with only twelve historic reverse
circulation ("RC") holes drilled to date (see Figure 3). However, these drill holes produced 10
significant gold intersections with two holes hitting wide zones:
8m @ 5.4 g/t Au, including 4m @ 10.1 g/t Au, and open at depth (BRC30); and
8m @ 3.9 g/t Au, including 2m @ 9 g/t Au, (BRC19).
There has been no follow-up drilling of these holes. Historical production was also carried out at
Rutherfords Find of 194 ounces of gold from 308 tonnes at an average recovered grade of 19.6 g/t
Au.

Reynolds Find
The Reynolds Find prospect has been explored by several previous title holders. The best intercepts
were encountered in 3 of the 4 holes drilled on a section immediately east of the historical workings.
