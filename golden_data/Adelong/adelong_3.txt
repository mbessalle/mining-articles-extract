ASX Release
12 March 2025
Completion of Adelong Venture Definitive Agreement
Great Divide Mining Ltd (ASX:GDM) is pleased to announce that it today completed Definitive
Agreements with Adelong Gold Ltd (ASX:ADG) for the Farm-in at its’ Challenger Gold Mine in
Adelong, NSW.
Key Points:
• GDM will pay $300,000 to Challenger Mines Pty Ltd, (Challenger) owner of the Challenger
Gold Mine and wholly owned subsidiary of ADG, for a 15% interest in Challenger. These funds
are to be deployed towards maintenance, refurbishment and restart of the Challenger gold
processing plant.
• GDM becomes the operator of the Challenger Gold Mine and will rapidly move to complete
the restart of processing operations.
• GDM will free-carry ADG to first gold pour at the Challenger Gold Mine, at which point, GDM
will increase its holding to 51% of Challenger.
Commenting on the completion of the Farm-in, CEO of GDM, Justin Haines, said:
“Finalisation of the Definitive Agreements puts GDM squarely onto the path to produce first gold from
the Challenger Gold Mine. Our aim is to produce first gold as rapidly as possible then expand the
operation to primary mining and increase the plant capacity. The planning for this phase will advance
once the initial production is confirmed.”
GDM announced on 11 November 2024 that it had signed a binding term sheet with ADG and its
wholly owned subsidiary Challenger to recommence operation of the historic Challenger Gold Mine
(Adelong Venture). This agreement, and the change in the nature of GDM’s business from explorer
to that of miner and processor, was approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting
held on 7th January 2025.
GDM completed due diligence on Challenger on 23 January 2025. The parties have now finalised
binding agreements for GDM to acquire an initial stake of 15% in Challenger and become operator
of the Challenger Gold Mine. GDM’s focus will be on rapidly moving the Challenger Gold Mine back
on to a production footing.
GDM thanks both its shareholders for their continuing support, and ADG for their co-operation in
reaching this significant milestone.
