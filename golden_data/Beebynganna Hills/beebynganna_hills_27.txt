FENIX ACQUIRES BEEBYNGANNA HILLS 
IRON ORE PROJECT 
NEW TENEMENTS EXPAND STRATEGIC POSITION IN 
THE WELD RANGE 
Highlights 
• 
Strategic Acquisition of Weld Range Iron Ore Projects significantly expands regional land 
package and includes near mine opportunities for discovery of new high-grade iron ore.  
• 
Beebynganna Hills Iron Ore Project acquired from Spartan Resources Limited (ASX:SPR) 
where previous exploration by Giralia Resources NL identified hematite grading up to 65% 
Fe and located only ~18km from Iron Ridge and ~13 km to Beebyn-W11  
• 
Beebyn North exploration tenement application by Fenix secures strategic position at the 
northeast end of the Weld Range located ~14 km from Beebyn-W11 
• 
New tenements provide logical opportunities for resource expansion in close proximity 
to Fenix’s existing mining operations at Iron Ridge and Beebyn-W11 and with access to 
Fenix’s infrastructure and transport logistics solutions 
Fenix Resources Limited (ASX: FEX) (Fenix or the Company) is pleased to announce the 
Company has secured two new tenements in the Weld Range including the historic Beebynganna 
Hills Iron Ore Project (Beebynganna Hills) and, subject to grant, a new exploration tenement to the 
north of Beebyn-W11 (Beebyn North). The new near-mine exploration assets expand Fenix’s 
strategic holdings in the region and provide additional opportunities to identify high-grade satellite 
iron ore deposits with access to the existing infrastructure at Iron Ridge and Beebyn-W11. 
Fenix’s Executive Chairman, Mr John Welborn, commented: 
“Fenix has demonstrated the extraordinary value that we can unlock from the iron ore deposits of 
the Weld Range. Since 2020, we have mined more than six million tonnes of high-quality iron ore 
products from our Iron Ridge Iron Ore Mine, generating more than $800 million in revenues. We are 
currently preparing to commence mining in the nearby Beebyn-W11 deposit. The fully integrated 
mining, logistics and port operations we have established in the Mid-West continue to demonstrate 
we can unlock value from previously stranded ore bodies and deliver exceptional cashflows, profits, 
and outstanding return on investment.  
“In 2025 we expect to increase annualised production from 1.3 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes and 
have confidence our excellent regional infrastructure has significant capacity to support further 
growth. Historic exploration activity in the Weld Range has identified numerous high-quality iron ore 
deposits and the expansion of Fenix’s regional footprint is a priority to support our plans to continue 
to grow production volumes. We are committed to unlocking the full potential of the region’s iron ore 
assets for the benefit of all our stakeholders.”

Strategic Expansion of Regional Tenure 
The Weld Range – a prolific iron ore region 
The Weld Range is located in Western Australia’s Mid-West, approximately 65 km South-West of 
Meekatharra, 50 km North-West of Cue and approximately 500 km via road to Geraldton Port. The 
range extends over a length of nearly 60 km and has a width of between 3 km to 5 km. Iron 
mineralisation was first discovered in the Weld Range in the late 19th century and modern 
exploration since the 1960’s has defined high-quality hematite ore bodies at Beebyn, Madoonga, 
and Iron Ridge.   
While several high-grade low impurity ore bodies have been identified, much of the Weld Range 
remains underexplored by modern standards, particularly in areas where access was deemed 
difficult, or outdated exploration techniques were employed. These factors present a compelling 
opportunity for further discoveries of high-grade hematite ore bodies.

Beebynganna Hills (E 51/1681) 
Beebynganna Hills is located approximately 18 km southeast of Iron Ridge within an area 
prospective for hematite mineralisation. Historical exploration, including drilling campaigns 
conducted by previous owner Giralia Resources NL (ASX: GIR) (Giralia) up to 2009, identified

multiple zones of significant high-grade hematite iron mineralisation with samples grading up to 65% 
Fe.   
Surface sampling programs identified rock chip samples exceeding 60% Fe identified across the 
11km strike length.  
Drilling programs conducted by Giralia targeted three of the seven identified hematite zones with 
notable intersections include RCBH021, which returned 58% Fe over 14 metres, RCBH102 (59.1% 
Fe over 28 metres) and RCBH103 (58.3% Fe over 24 metres). The mineralisation remains open to 
the north, presenting clear opportunities for future resource expansion (See Reference Notes). 
Beebynganna Hills Acquisition Terms  
The Company has agreed binding terms with Spartan Resources Limited to acquire E51/1681 on 
the following terms: 
• 
Cash consideration of A$250,000 and a milestone payment of A$1,000,000 upon the 
extraction and sale of 1,000,000 tonnes of iron ore from the area of E51/1681. 
• 
E51/1681 is acquired subject to the gold and other rights held by E79 Exploration Pty Ltd 
(E79) and is conditional on the parties entering into a deed of covenant in respect of the 
mineral rights sharing agreement and E51/1681 whereby E79 holds all mineral rights in the 
tenement save as for the iron ore and ferrous mineral rights which shall be held by Fenix. 
• 
The transaction, and conditions precedent for completion, are otherwise on customary terms 
and conditions for a transaction of this nature. 
Beebyn North (E 51/2245)  
Beebyn North, located 14 km northeast of Beebyn-W11, is a 5 km strike-length tenement within the 
Weld Range greenstone belt, specifically in the Widgie Mia Formation, the hosting sequence for 
high-grade banded iron formation (BIF) deposits. This geological setting is consistent with the iron-
rich lithologies that define the region’s major hematite deposits. 
Historical exploration, including aeromagnetic surveys flown by Crosslands Resources Ltd 
(Crosslands) in 2008 (A100021, WAMEX) and rock chip sampling conducted by Murchison Metals 
Ltd (ASX: MMX) in 2009 (A74016, WAMEX), returned iron grades up to 63% Fe, underscoring the 
potential for high-grade mineralisation. The geological and geophysical data, and the project’s 
proximity to Beebyn-W11, highlight Beebyn North as having obvious potential for the identification 
of a significant deposit of high-grade hematite mineralisation (see Reference Notes). 
Next Steps 
Fenix has commenced a regional evaluation of historic exploration work on the Company’s expanded 
Weld Range exploration portfolio. The objective of this work is to validate and map potential hematite 
targets across the Weld Range and to plan an exploration drilling program in 2025 aimed at resource 
definition.

APPENDIX 2 
JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1  
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
The following JORC Table 1 is completed on the basis of providing context for information available regarding the tenements acquired (E 51/1681 
and E 51/2245). (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Sampling 
techniques 
• 
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, 
such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These 
examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
• 
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple 
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation 
may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may 
warrant disclosure of detailed information. 
E 51/1681: 
• 
The exploration was overseen by Giralia Resources NL, based in Perth, Australia 
between 2008-2011.  
• 
Reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 2 m samples from which 1-3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 100- 150 g pulp for XRF and LOI analysis. 
• 
Sample QA/QC included field duplicate samples and standards to ensure sample 
representivity and appropriate calibration of tools.  
E 51/2245: 
• 
The exploration was overseen by Murchison Metals NL and Crosslands Resources, 
based in Perth, Australia between 2006-2008.

the dip of the mineralisation. 
E 51/2245: 
• 
No drilling has been conducted to date. 
 
Drill sample 
recovery 
• 
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results 
assessed. 
• 
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
samples. 
• 
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample 
bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
E 51/1681: 
• 
RC cuttings were collected through a cyclone riffle splitter, which ensured efficient 
retrieval. 
• 
Reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 2m riffle split composites. 
E 51/2245: 
No drilling has been conducted to date 
Logging 
•

Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting 
and style of mineralisation. 
E 51/1681 & E 51/2245: 
• 
The deposits are located in an Archaean granite-greenstone terrain within the Yilgarn Craton. 
• 
The mineralisation includes a blend of banded hematite (in both specular and earthy forms), goethite, and shaly limonite. 
• 
The regional geography is characterised by metabasalts, primarily consisting of doleritic formations, along with some minor basaltic and 
gabbroic formations. This area stretches for nearly 60 km in length and spans a width of 3 to 5 km. 
• 
These formations are indicative of ancient volcanic activity and play a crucial role in hosting mineral deposits. 
• 
The presence of banded iron formations is important, as they serve as primary sources of iron ore. At Beebynganna Hills, the mineralisation 
is primarily associated with hematite and goethite, which are commonly found in BIFs.  
Drill hole 
Information 
• 
A summary of all information

information for all Material drill 
holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill 
hole collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – 
elevation above sea level in 
metres) of the drill hole collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down hole length and interception 
depth 
o 
hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information 
is justified on the basis that the 
information is not Material and this 
exclusion does not detract from 
the understanding of the report, 
the Competent Person should 
clearly explain why this is the 
case.

If it is not known and only the down 
hole lengths are reported, there 
should be a clear statement to this 
effect (eg ‘down hole length, true 
width not known’).
