The Stellar Lithium Property has seen minimal historical exploration, yet it holds potential for
spodumene-bearing pegmatite, due to the regionally mapped greenstone belt rocks on the property.
The majority of the spodumene-bearing LCT-style pegmatites in the James Bay region are hosted
within greenstone-belt rock types. The Stellar Lithium Property will be explored along-side the
spring/summer exploration work that is planned at the Mia Lithium Property.
"The addition of the Stellar Lithium Property cements our potential as the next premier lithium
exploration story in Quebec, and with our strong treasury we look forward to rapidly advancing both
assets to the benefit of our shareholders," said Alicia Milne, President & CEO of Q2 Metals.
Stock Option Grant
Pursuant to its equity incentive plan and subject to the acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange,
the Company has granted 1,250,000 stock options to directors, officers, and consultants of the
Company to purchase an aggregate of 1,250,000 common shares in the capital of the Company at
