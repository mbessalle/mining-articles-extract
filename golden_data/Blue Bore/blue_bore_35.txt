OPTION AGREEMENT SIGNED OVER THE BLUE BORE COPPER 
PROJECT NORTHERN TERRITORY 
 
TechGen Metals Limited (“TechGen” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has executed an Option 
Agreement pursuant to which the Company will be granted an option to acquire an 80% legal and beneficial interest 
in the Blue Bore Copper Project in the Northern Territory, Australia (Project).  
The Project offers a rare first-mover advantage in an untouched region of the Northern Territory, with exceptional 
scale potential. Located in a geologically compelling setting analogous to world-class sediment-hosted copper deposits 
like the Kupferschiefer deposits in Europe, this project presents a unique opportunity to uncover a significant copper 
discovery. Historical evidence, including potentially anomalous copper levels in a water sample and thick intervals of 
unexplained blue shale and blue limestone, combined with its proximity to key geological features, positions the 
Project as a high-upside investment in a region that has never been explored for minerals. 
 
BLUE BORE COPPER PROJECT - STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS 
 
➢ 
A Unique Copper Opportunity in an Untouched Region: A conceptual copper project located in an 
unexplored region of the Northern Territory with no previous mineral exploration activity, offering first-
mover advantage and significant scale potential.  
➢ 
Historic Water Bore Evidence: A 315-metre-thick interval of blue rocks (blue shale and blue limestone) was 
logged between 27 and 342 metres downhole in a government water bore drilled to 381 metres in January 
1900. The source of the blue colour remains unknown, warranting further investigation.  
➢ 
Anomalous Copper in Water Sample: A single water sample taken from the bore in August 2000 returned a 
copper concentration of 653 µg/l (equivalent to 0.653 ppm Cu), which is considered potentially anomalous 
for a water sample. However, rock samples from the bore were not analysed at the time.  
➢ 
Geological Setting: The Project is situated in the intracratonic Pedirka Basin (Permian–Triassic age), overlying 
the Amadeus and Warburton basins, which in turn sit atop Proterozoic-aged basement rocks4.  
➢ 
Prospective for Sediment-Hosted Copper: Geoscience Australia has identified the Amadeus and Warburton 
basins as prospective for sediment-hosted copper mineralisation2. 
➢ 
Proximity to Key Geological Features: Studies show 85% of the world’s sediment-hosted base metal deposits 
occur within 200 km of thick lithospheric edges.3 The Project is located within this critical 200 km range. 
➢ 
Analogous to World-Class Copper Deposits: The Pedirka Basin is age-equivalent to the Zechstein Basin in 
Germany-Poland, host to the world-class Kupferschiefer sediment-hosted copper deposits1.   
 
                    
TechGen’s Managing Director, Ashley Hood, commented: “The Blue Bore Copper Project is a unique opportunity to 
secure a first-mover advantage in an untouched region with immense discovery potential. This area, often referred to 
as ‘elephant country’ in exploration terms, presents a rare chance to uncover a world-class sediment-hosted copper 
deposit. With no prior mineral exploration, the project offers a low-cost entry into a region with significant scale 
potential, aligning perfectly with our strategy of pursuing assets capable of delivering transformative value. 
Copper is at the forefront of global efforts to decarbonise, driven by increasing demand from battery and solar 
industries targeting cleaner emissions and a greener future. The Blue Bore Project, alongside our existing copper assets, 
positions the Company to capitalise on these growing market dynamics while striving to deliver a discovery of 
significance for our shareholders.”

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE BLUE BORE COPPER PROJECT 
The Project is located 300 km to the southeast of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory (Figure 2). The Project consists 
of 6 Exploration Licences, EL33313 – EL33318, covering a combined area of 3,950 km2. The Project is a conceptual 
grass-roots copper exploration project which the Company considers high-risk yet potentially high-reward. The Project 
area has not been previously explored for minerals. 
Some intriguing information comes from a government water bore drilled within the southern Project area in January 
1900 (Figure 2 & 3). A 315-metre-thick interval of blue rocks (blue shale & blue limestone) was logged in the hole from 
27 metres downhole through to 342 metres downhole with the hole ending at a 381-metre depth. A depiction of the 
geological log of the water bore is shown as Figure 3. The source of the blue colour referred to in the water bore logs 
is currently unknown and no mention of mineralogy or the potential cause of the blue colour is made in the water 
bore log. 
A single water sample taken from a pool of water at the water bore in August 2000 returned a copper analysis of 653 
µg/l (equivalent to 0.653 ppm Cu) which is considered potentially anomalous for a water sample (Table 1). A single 
sample is insufficient to gain a clear understanding of copper levels in ground water across the area, therefore 
additional ground exploration work is required in the near-term. Rock samples from the water bore were not sent for 
analysis. 
LOCATION AND GEOLOGY OF THE BLUE BORE COPPER PROJECT 
The Project area is located in the intracratonic Pedirka Basin (Permian – Triassic age), which overlies the Amadeus and 
Warburton basins which sit above Proterozoic-aged basement rocks (Munson & Ahmad, 2013). The Pedirka Basin is 
up to 1.5 km thick and contains fluvioglacial, fluvial, lacustrine and coal swamp, and continental red bed deposits. The 
basin has an area of approximately 100,000 km2 across the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland.

SEDIMENT-HOSTED COPPER STUDY INFORMATION (AUSTRALIA & INTERNATIONAL) 
A study completed by Geoscience Australia assessed the potential for the occurrence of sediment-hosted copper 
mineral systems across Australia (Cloutier et al., 2023). This study produced three mineral potential models utilising a 
large volume of precompetitive geoscience data combined with mineral systems expertise. The mineral potential 
models successfully predict the location of major known sediment-hosted stratiform copper and Mount Isa-type 
copper deposits while also highlighting new areas of elevated prospectivity in under-explored regions with no 
currently known mineralisation occurrences. This assessment study highlighted the Amadeus and Warburton basins, 
which underlie the Pedirka Basin, as prospective areas for sediment-hosted copper mineralisation and a map of Model 
2 from the study is included as Figure 1 with the location of the Project added. 
International research studies indicate that 85% of the world’s sediment-hosted base metal deposits regardless of 
their age, and all giant deposits (> 10 Mt of contained metal), occur within 200 km of the edge of thick lithosphere 
(Czarnota et al., 2020; Hoggard et al., 2020). These studies have used seismic tomography to outline the edge of thick 
lithosphere, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, and the 170 km deep contour is used to represent this edge. 
The Project occurs within the 200 km range of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as shown on Figure 4. 
Studies published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) show that sediment-hosted copper deposits are 
known to mostly occur from the Proterozoic through to the Phanerozoic (2,100 Ma – 250 Ma ago; Cox et al., 2007). 
The Pedirka Basin is equivalent in age to the Zechstein Basin in Germany-Poland which is host to the giant 
Kupferschiefer sediment-hosted copper deposits (Borg et al., 2012).   
The Exploration Licences are currently under application and the Company will move to get the licences granted as 
soon as possible so on ground exploration activities can commence.

Cautionary statement on blue rocks logged in water bore - Visual estimates of mineral abundance should never be 
considered a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses where concentrations or grades are the factor of principal 
economic interest. Visual estimates also potentially provide no information regarding impurities or deleterious 
physical properties relevant to valuations.

Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
• 
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. 
• 
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple 
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation 
may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling 
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may 
warrant disclosure of detailed information.

Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures 
and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. 
• 
If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised 
structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed 
and reported if material. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
A single water sample was taken in August 2000 from water pooled on the surface 
around the water bore (Anacoora Bore RN 977). 
 
Sample security 
• 
The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
The measures taken to ensure sample security are unknown. 
Audits or reviews 
• 
The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
No formal audit has been completed on the data being reported.

Section 2 Reporting of Exploration Results 
(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section.) 
Criteria 
JORC Code explanation 
Commentary 
Mineral tenement 
and land tenure 
status 
• 
Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or 
material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding 
royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and 
environmental settings. 
• 
The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known 
impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. 
 
• 
The Blue Bore Project comprises 6 Exploration Licence Applications, namely EL33313 
– EL33318. The licences cover a combined area of 3,950 km2 and are owned 100% by 
Norman McCleary. The Company has executed an Option agreement with Norman 
McCleary. The 6 Exploration Licence Applications are still at the application stage. The 
Company does not know how long it will take for the Exploration Licences to be granted. 
The Company understands that prior to the granting of the Exploration Licence 
Applications agreement with relevant Native Title Parties will need to occur. 
Exploration done 
by other parties 
• 
Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. 
• 
To the best of our knowledge the only exploration completed in the project area has 
been exploration for coal and oil and gas. 
• 
We are not aware of any exploration undertaken for minerals. 
Geology 
• 
Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. 
• 
The project is situated in the intracratonic Pedirka Basin (Permian–Triassic age), 
overlying the Amadeus and Warburton basins, which in turn sit atop Proterozoic-aged 
basement rocks4.  
Drill 
hole 
Information 
• 
A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results 
including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: 
o 
easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
o 
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill 
hole collar 
o 
dip and azimuth of the hole 
o 
down hole length and interception depth 
o 
hole length. 
• 
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not 
Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the 
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
Water bore information is tabulated in the body of the announcement. 
Data aggregation 
methods 
• 
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated. 
• 
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer 
lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
• 
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly 
stated. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
A single water sample was taken in August 2000 from water pooled on the surface 
around the water bore (Anacoora Bore RN 977). 
• 
Only water sample results are mentioned. 
• 
No intercept widths are discussed. 
• 
No metal equivalent values have been made. 
Relationship 
between 
mineralisation 
widths 
and 
intercept lengths 
• 
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported. 
• 
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’). 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
A single water sample was taken in August 2000 from water pooled on the surface 
around the water bore (Anacoora Bore RN 977). 
• 
Only water sample results are mentioned.. 
Diagrams 
• 
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
• 
Suitable diagrams and tables have been included in the body of the report.

Commentary 
Balanced 
reporting 
• 
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced 
to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. 
• 
All data is previous. 
• 
A single water sample was taken in August 2000 from water pooled on the surface 
around the water bore (Anacoora Bore RN 977). 
Other substantive 
exploration data 
• 
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not 
limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey 
results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk 
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or 
contaminating substances. 
• 
All meaningful and material exploration data has been discussed and no new 
exploration data is known. 
Further work 
• 
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth 
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). 
• 
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main 
geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not 
commercially sensitive. 
• 
Future work at the project is likely to include field visits.
