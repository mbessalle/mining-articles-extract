ABOUT ADELONG GOLD 
Adelong Gold Limited (ASX: ADG) is a minerals explorer that owns the Adelong Gold Mine in New South Wales 
(NSW) and highly prospective Lithium Tenement packages in the prolific ‘Lithium Valley’ of Minas Gerais and 
in Paraiba Province within the Borborema Region, both located in Brazil. The Company is on the path to 
becoming a mineral producer at its Adelong Goldfield Project. 
In May 2020, Adelong took control of the Adelong Goldfield which covers 70km2, comprising the old Adelong 
Gold Project situated in Southern NSW located approximately 20km from Tumut and 80km from Gundagai.   
 
The Project now carries a JORC (2012) Resource of 188,000oz, following  a maiden JORC Resource for the 
Perkins West deposit at Gibraltar of 18,300oz with the potential to expand that resource at depth and along 
strike. Project resources have now increased by 45% from project resources in place on acquisition.  Until 
recently, Adelong was a producing mine. 
 
In December 2023, Adelong finalised its acquisition of a 100% interest in three applications for lithium 
exploration permits (Santa Rita do Aracuai Lithium Project) located in the world-class ‘Lithium Valley' in Minas 
Gerais, in Brazil. This acquisition represents a pivotal transaction for the Company as it secures a strategic 
landholding in a globally significant, mining friendly region for hard-rock lithium spodumene deposits.  
 
The ‘Lithium Valley’ accounts for all officially recognised lithium reserves in Brazil and is an emerging world-
class lithium-producing region. Significant lithium discoveries by industry peers include Sigma Lithium’s 
(NASDAQ: SGML) Grota do Cirio Deposit, Latin Resources’ (ASX:LRS) Salinas Project – Colina Deposits and 
Lithium Ionic’s (TSX.V:LTH) Itinga Project - Bandiera Deposit. 
 
At the Santa Rita Do Araçuaí Project, exploration activities commenced in December 2023 with the initial 
reconnaissance program, completed in February 2024, identifying two key areas for further lithium

exploration. The geological assessment identified indicators for potential lithium mineralisation in 
Neoproterozoic formations, including the Macaúbas Group and Salinas Formation. Future exploration plans 
include detailed mapping and stream sediment/float geochemical analysis to pinpoint potential pegmatitic 
bodies and lithium indicators.  
 
In March 2024, the Company announced they had been granted a further 10 Brazilian licenses at the Paraiba 
Province Project. These licenses further increase the exploration ground under license by 162.8km2. These 
extra licenses are prospective for lithium pegmatites and are located within the Borborema Region, which 
comprises Proterozoic rocks that form part of the Brasiliano Fold belt and which host plutonic intrusions 
similar to the “Lithium Valley” region of Minas Gerais Province. This region contains known lithium 
pegmatites and many deposits/occurrences of tantalum, beryl, niobium, and aquamarine, which are 
commonly associated with lithium-type pegmatites.
